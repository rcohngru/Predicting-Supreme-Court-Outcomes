2010,"PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing",114,Elena Kagan,"Well, Mr. Lefkowitz, why should-- --Do you contest, Mr. Lefkowitz, your ability to make that request? I know that you contest your obligation to make that request, but do you think you could go to the FDA and make that request and set a process in motion? Well, if you could go to the FDA, why shouldn't we look at this suit in this way: That the plaintiffs are bringing a standard failure to warn claim; that you then have a preemption defense, that you'll say it's impossible; and then in order to litigate that preemption defense, the question will be, well, if you had gone to the FDA, what would the FDA have done? Would it in fact have required both brand names and generics to change the label? And if it would have, you would not have had -- been put in an impossible position. But Mr. Lefkowitz, I think what the Respondents would say is that you are mischaracterizing their complaint and making it into something that it's not. Their complaint is a standard state failure to warn claim. Now, you have a preemption defense to that claim, and in that preemption defense there's going to be questions about your disclosure obligations and whether the FDA would have responded in a certain way to your disclosure obligations, but it's in a fundamentally different posture than the one that you're suggesting. Well, I agree that you don't have any ability yourself to change the warning, but here's what the FDA has said. The FDA has said if an ANDA applicant -- and that's you; you're an ANDA applicant -- believes new safety information should be added to a product's labeling, presumably because they've gotten information that suggests that the product's labeling is wrong, then it should contact the FDA, and the FDA will determine whether the labeling for the generic and listed drugs should be revised. Mr. Kneedler, suppose that I'm not sure I agree with you that there is an obligation of the kind that you say for a generic drug manufacturer to come forward and request a label, but I do think that there's an opportunity for that manufacturer to come forward and ask the FDA to revise a label. If that's the way I read the law, does your result follow? Do you think, then, that State law claims should be able to go forward? Well, Mr. Lefkowitz, if you had asked, you would be in a different situation. If you had asked and the FDA had sat on it or was negotiating, then you could say, look, we've done all we can right now. But you're not in that situation. You, in fact, have not done all you can right now to change the label because you never wrote that letter. ",well mr lefkowitz why should do you contest mr lefkowitz your ability to make that request i know that you contest your obligation to make that request but do you think you could go to the fda and make that request and set a process in motion well if you could go to the fda why should not we look at this suit in this way that the plaintiff be bring a standard failure to warn claim that you then have a preemption defense that you will say it be impossible and then in order to litigate that preemption defense the question will be well if you have go to the fda what would the fda have do would it in fact have require both brand name and generic to change the label and if it would have you would not have have be put in an impossible position but mr lefkowitz i think what the respondent would say be that you be mischaracterizing their complaint and make it into something that it be not their complaint be a standard state failure to warn claim now you have a preemption defense to that claim and in that preemption defense there be go to be question about your disclosure obligation and whether the fda would have respond in a certain way to your disclosure obligation but it be in a fundamentally different posture than the one that you be suggest well i agree that you do not have any ability yourself to change the warning but here s what the fda have say the fda have say if an anda applicant and that be you you be an anda applicant believe new safety information should be add to a product s labeling presumably because they have get information that suggest that the product s labeling be wrong then it should contact the fda and the fda will determine whether the labeling for the generic and listed drug should be revise mr kneedler suppose that I be not sure i agree with you that there be an obligation of the kind that you say for a generic drug manufacturer to come forward and request a label but i do think that there be an opportunity for that manufacturer to come forward and ask the fda to revise a label if that be the way i read the law do your result follow do you think then that state law claim should be able to go forward well mr lefkowitz if you have ask you would be in a different situation if you have ask and the fda have sit on it or be negotiate then you could say look we have do all we can right now but you be not in that situation you in fact have not do all you can right now to change the label because you never write that letter ,152.48000000000005,Roberts Court,"Mar 30, 2011","PLIVA, Inc., et al.",Gladys Mensing,09-993,"Dec 10, 2010","Jun 23, 2011",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2010,J.D.B. v. North Carolina,114,Elena Kagan,"Do we need either imaginative powers or empirical data to know that when a 13-year-old is brought into a room in his school, taken out of class, four people are there, two are police officers, one is assistant principal, threatened with custody, that that person is not going to feel free to take off and leave? General Cooper, I'm not sure how I understand or that I understand how this would be turning Miranda upside down. Miranda is already an incredibly complicated test about when those warnings need to be given, all right. So there are all manner of circumstances which go into the determination of whether a person would feel free to learn -- leave, whether a person would feel as though he were in custody, a thousand things, how many people are in the room, how long the interrogation is, where the interrogation is, the particular circumstances of the interrogation. So, this is not a bright line test, and all that we would be doing here would be adding an additional objective factor to an already multifaceted inquiry. Counsel, do you agree with the solicitor general's view that a blind person should be treated as a blind person for -- for these purposes? And a deaf person should be treated as a deaf person for these purposes? As is youth. As is youth, an obvious external circumstance that this boy was 13 years old. You know, I don't agree with that. You are trying to understand this situation as the blind person would have seen it or as the deaf person would have seen it or as the 13-year-old would have seen it, and I don't understand why it's different. But that's all we're doing with the young person. And in fact, most of us, many of us, have a great deal more experience understanding the world through the eyes of a young person or children, perhaps, than understanding the eyes -- the world through the eyes of a severely sensory deprived person. We're asking the exact same thing in both contexts: What is this person -- what is this -- what do the objective circumstances appear to a person in this situation? Mr. Feigin-- --I'm sorry.

Was there anything other than the medical testimony and the billing sheets, or is that the extent of it? Although that-- --Well, Mr. Bilderback, going back to your question of what's a claim. So the claim here could be ineffective assistance at the penalty stage. Or you could be saying, no, the claim is ineffective assistance for failing to present evidence of organic brain damage. That would be a narrower understanding of the claim. Or still narrower, it might be ineffective assistance for failing to present evidence of a particular kind of brain damage, frontal lobe brain damage, which is what the new doctor said, as opposed to what the old doctor said, which was bipolar disorder. So how do we choose the level of generality, if you will, when we try to figure out what the claim is? But, Mr. Kennedy, do you agree with the State that there are two thing at issue here, there is the new medical testimony and there is also the billing sheets? Oh, but that's not -- that was not presented as evidence in the State court, the billing sheets?

Roche Molecular Systems, Inc.",114,Elena Kagan,"Do those policies ever distinguish between Federally funded projects and Non-Federally funded projects? Mr. Stewart, could I ask you just a factual question? When the Federal Government contracts with universities or other nonprofits, does it require those universities to get assignments from their employees? And if so, how? So why doesn't the Federal Government just require assignments from employees to the university? Mr. Stewart, do you know, is this a Stanford-specific problem or is it a more general problem? In other words, are there many universities that have agreements like Stanford's that would be subject to the Federal Circuit's ruling? Or is this just an example of one university that unfortunately has a bad agreement? Do you have an explanation, Mr. Fleming, of why it is that Congress left such a big problem off the table? In other words, clearly Congress was thinking about how to protect the government's interests with respect to these patents, and to say, well, we have these interests with respect to patents that the university owns, but we don't have those same interests with respect to patents that the individual researcher owns, just seems bizarre.

2010,"J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. v. Nicastro",114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Fergenson, in your question presented to this Court, you asked whether there's personal jurisdiction -- and I'm quoting here -- ""solely because the manufacturer targets the United States market for the sale of its product. "" So I'm taking from that, that you acknowledge that this manufacturer, McIntyre, a British manufacturer, targeted the United States market for the sale of its product. That's correct, yes? That's your question presented-- --Did this -- well, I'll just ask you, then: Did this manufacturer target the United States market? Did it want to sell its products in the United States? Okay. So what does that mean, exactly, Mr. Fergenson? Because the United States is the United States. It's made up of 50 States. So I assume that what that means is the manufacturer wanted to sell its products in each of the 50 States. Is that right? It only wanted to sell its product in a few States? Right, anywhere. So if the distributor came up with California, that was great. If the distributor came up with a customer in New Jersey, that was great. As many as possible, more the better, all over the United States. Is that right? Exactly. So you targeted New Jersey no less than you targeted California or New York or Illinois or Massachusetts or anything else. You targeted the entire United States? Why shouldn't there be jurisdiction in each of the States you targeted? Well, suable in any State where the incident arises. This is not general jurisdiction. This is specific jurisdiction. So the question is, when you target the entire United States and each of the 50 States within that and an accident occurs within one of those States, are you subject to jurisdiction in that State for that accident, for a claim based on that accident? Not generally, but just for a claim based on that accident. Didn't even Justice O'Connor -- you referenced the Asahi opinions, but Justice O'Connor said as long as there's purposeful availment, there is specific jurisdiction, and there is purposeful availment when there's an active effort to target a market. Mr. Fergenson, just picking up where Justice Ginsburg left off, Ohio is a perfectly good place for jurisdiction over a claim between the British manufacturer and its distributor in Ohio. Any kind of contract claim, a claim based on the agreement between the two, Ohio is the appropriate place for jurisdiction. But Ohio does not seem the appropriate place for jurisdiction -- and again, we're talking about specific jurisdiction, not general -- as to a claim based on an accident that occurred in New Jersey. The entire idea of specific jurisdiction is that you need a relationship between the defendant and the forum and the claim, and here the claim arose in New Jersey and was in fact not related to Ohio. Mr. Fergenson, could I try another hypothetical? But, Mr. Fergenson, the question is whether seeking to serve a market -- and here you're seeking to serve a market in each of the 50 States -- is purposeful availment. So let me just try a different hypothetical. Suppose you had the same arrangement with your distributor in Ohio, but the arrangement was not to serve the entire United States market. Instead, the arrangement was to serve only five States in the Midwest. That's what you wanted, your client wanted, the market to be. So it was going to be Ohio and Indiana and Illinois and Michigan and Iowa, all right? So now a machine blows up in Illinois. Is there jurisdiction in Illinois? There is jurisdiction in Illinois, even though your relationship with your distributor was in Ohio. But there's jurisdiction in Illinois because the machine blew up there and you were seeking to serve the market; that's right? Okay. Now we have -- now we say this is working very well. Let's get another nine distributors on board. We'll give each of them five states, all right? Now, if I understand you correctly, now you're liable all over the United States because you've had this relationship with ten different distributors, each of whom are going to serve five states. So there's personal jurisdiction in any state where a machine blows up. And now I say: Let's forget these ten distributors. Who needs ten distributors? I'll just have one distributor. Why is there any difference? Mr. Fergenson, with respect, this distributor was told to sell as many products as it could in as many States as it could. Mr. Ross, do you think if there's a small business in the United States that sells a product and that actively seeks to serve a foreign market, maybe it's Great Britain, maybe it's China, and that product blows up in that foreign country -- Great Britain, China -- do you think that the manufacturer, the American manufacturer is subject to jurisdiction there? All -- all over the world this is true; is that right? Mr. Ross, we do that now; isn't that right? And Mr. Ross, isn't the point that he was selling by using large convention sites in the United States, expecting that people from other -- would show up to those large convention sites? I know that Justice Alito doesn't want to hear this, but New Jersey doesn't have all that many large convention sites like Las Vegas does. Newark is not such a hot place, but they're expecting people from Newark to go and look at these machines and buy these machines. That's the marketing system that's used for these massive machines that they're trying to sell nationwide. And Mr. Fergenson, isn't that what Justice O'Connor said in Asahi, that the component manufacturer may have all the knowledge in the world -- for Justice Brennan, that was enough; for Justice O'Connor, it was not enough that knowledge was insufficient, that there had to be purposeful availment, that there had to be an active decision, a choice to seek the market. And -- and I understand that, on your view, McIntyre made that choice. Mr. Fergenson, could I ask you a question? Mr. Fergenson, Toyota, Honda, Volkswagen -- pick your car company -- sells many millions of cars to the United States. They start flowing up here, they operate through independent distributors only. Can they be subject to jurisdiction in any of the States? ",mr fergenson in your question present to this court you ask whether there be personal jurisdiction and I be quote here solely because the manufacturer target the united state market for the sale of its product so I be take from that that you acknowledge that this manufacturer mcintyre a british manufacturer target the united state market for the sale of its product that be correct yes that be your question present do this well I will just ask you then do this manufacturer target the united state market do it want to sell its product in the united state okay so what do that mean exactly mr fergenson because the united state be the united state it be make up of state so i assume that what that mean be the manufacturer want to sell its product in each of the state be that right it only want to sell its product in a few state right anywhere so if the distributor come up with california that be great if the distributor come up with a customer in new jersey that be great as many as possible more the good all over the united state be that right exactly so you target new jersey no less than you target california or new york or illinois or massachusetts or anything else you target the entire united state why should not there be jurisdiction in each of the state you target well suable in any state where the incident arise this be not general jurisdiction this be specific jurisdiction so the question be when you target the entire united state and each of the state within that and an accident occur within one of those state be you subject to jurisdiction in that state for that accident for a claim base on that accident not generally but just for a claim base on that accident do not even justice oconnor you reference the asahi opinion but justice oconnor say as long as there be purposeful availment there be specific jurisdiction and there be purposeful availment when there be an active effort to target a market mr fergenson just pick up where justice ginsburg leave off ohio be a perfectly good place for jurisdiction over a claim between the british manufacturer and its distributor in ohio any kind of contract claim a claim base on the agreement between the two ohio be the appropriate place for jurisdiction but ohio do not seem the appropriate place for jurisdiction and again we be talk about specific jurisdiction not general as to a claim base on an accident that occur in new jersey the entire idea of specific jurisdiction be that you need a relationship between the defendant and the forum and the claim and here the claim arise in new jersey and be in fact not relate to ohio mr fergenson could i try another hypothetical but mr fergenson the question be whether seek to serve a market and here you be seek to serve a market in each of the state be purposeful availment so let me just try a different hypothetical suppose you have the same arrangement with your distributor in ohio but the arrangement be not to serve the entire united state market instead the arrangement be to serve only five state in the midwest that be what you want your client want the market to be so it be go to be ohio and indiana and illinois and michigan and iowa all right so now a machine blow up in illinois be there jurisdiction in illinois there be jurisdiction in illinois even though your relationship with your distributor be in ohio but there be jurisdiction in illinois because the machine blow up there and you we be seek to serve the market that be right okay now we have now we say this be work very well let us get another nine distributor on board we will give each of them five state all right now if i understand you correctly now you be liable all over the united state because you have have this relationship with ten different distributor each of whom be go to serve five state so there be personal jurisdiction in any state where a machine blow up and now i say let us forget these ten distributor who need ten distributor I will just have one distributor why be there any difference mr fergenson with respect this distributor be tell to sell as many product as it could in as many state as it could mr ross do you think if there be a small business in the united state that sell a product and that actively seek to serve a foreign market maybe it be great britain maybe it be china and that product blow up in that foreign country great britain china do you think that the manufacturer the american manufacturer be subject to jurisdiction there all all over the world this be true be that right mr ross we do that now be not that right and mr ross be not the point that he be sell by use large convention site in the united state expect that people from other would show up to those large convention site i know that justice alito do not want to hear this but new jersey do not have all that many large convention site like la vega do newark be not such a hot place but they be expect people from newark to go and look at these machine and buy these machine that be the marketing system that be use for these massive machine that they be try to sell nationwide and mr fergenson be not that what justice oconnor say in asahi that the component manufacturer may have all the knowledge in the world for justice brennan that be enough for justice oconnor it be not enough that knowledge be insufficient that there have to be purposeful availment that there have to be an active decision a choice to seek the market and and i understand that on your view mcintyre make that choice mr fergenson could i ask you a question

2010,"Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes",114,Elena Kagan,"I don't think that's quite fair, Mr. Boutrous. I think their argument was that the common policy was one of complete subjectivity, was one of using factors that allowed gender discrimination to come into all employment decisions. And in Watson, we suggested that that was a policy, a policy of using subjective factors only, when making employment decisions. That's exactly the policy that was alleged here. I -- I guess I'm just a little -- a little bit confused as to why excessive subjectivity is not a policy that can be alleged in a Title VII pattern and practice suit or in a Title VII disparate impact suit. Mr. Boutrous, I think that that suggests that the plaintiffs would have to demonstrate discrimination in every individual case, and that's never been the law. All that the plaintiffs have to demonstrate and, especially at this stage in the proceedings, is that there is a practice, a policy of subjectivity that on the whole results in discrimination against women, not that each one of these women in the class were themselves discriminated against. I thought your position was that this could not be certified under Rule 23(b)(3), either; is that correct? But you're not suggesting that they would be precluded on individual discrimination claims, are you?

2010,Turner v. Rogers,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Waxman-- --suppose the Court thinks that -- suppose the Court looks at this record and thinks this is a broken system and a violation of due process, but requiring a counsel in every case may go too far, and there may, in fact, be alternate procedures that a State could adopt that would comply with due process. And I know that this is not your submission, it's instead the solicitor general's submission, but if pressed on that point, what procedures do you think would be capable of giving a person in this situation a fair shake at this? Ms. Kruger, you say that the procedures here were inadequate, but that counsel in every case is not necessarily required. You say alternate procedures can provide people in this situation with a fair shake. But then when you look at the procedures that you actually say would comply with due process, they are remarkably anemic. Basically, you say that a form has to be provided. You don't require that there be anybody attached to the court, the kind of person that Justice Powell might have been talking about in Vitek, some kind of caseworker to assist the person with whatever questions he might have about the form or about how to fill it out. You don't require that the court make any findings. You don't require that the court even ask any questions. Apparently, your idea of the procedure is just to give a person a form. Am I reading you right? Ms. Kruger, could you say a bit more about the question that Mr. Waxman and Justice Scalia were talking about: how often these proceedings have the State on one side, how often they have the custodial parent on one side, whether there is counsel for the opposite side in many of these cases? Well, we couldn't really tell, could we, Mr. Bibas? Because he completely ignored the question. The entire transcript is less than two pages long. Mr. Turner talked about how he had no money and he was disabled. The court completely ignored him. The court also ignored the questions on the form for the order of contempt about whether he had any money. The court ignored that as well. Practically when those forms are used, the person fills out a form, and mostly they're just accepted, aren't they?

2010,"Erica P. John Fund, Inc. v. Halliburton Co.",114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Boies, what's the difference then? Why could that be disputed at the certification stage, but not the question of price impact? Well, how about materiality? Could you rebut materiality at the certification stage? Well, now I'm a little confused, because the efficient market and materiality are all part of the prima facie case triggering the Basic presumption. So, why couldn't you rebut one part of that case but not another part of that case? Well, whether there's an efficient market is also common to all members of the class, so why would you make an exception for that? But, Mr. Sterling, if I think -- if I disagree with you and I think that Oscar said that loss causation needs to be shown at the certification stage, you agree that that is not a correct statement of the law; is that correct? Mr. Sterling, I wasn't sure what argument you were making in your brief. One possible argument you could be making is that the plaintiffs have to show a price impact. Another possible argument you could be making is that you have to have the opportunity to rebut the plaintiff's use of the Basic presumption by yourself showing that there was no price impact. And you seemed often to be saying the first, even though I would think that the second is the most you can make as a -- as a plausible argument. Mr. Sterling, maybe this is just to repeat Justice Ginsburg's question, but what else is there? I mean, what would not be proper to introduce in the way that you're talking about at the certification stage? The Fifth Circuit suggested that scienter could come in at the -- at the certification stage. You're disclaiming that? On your rebuttal proof point, you said just now that all you had to do was come forward with some evidence, but that the burden remains on the plaintiff. Is that -- what kind of evidence do you think you have to come forward with in order to flip the burden back to the plaintiff? So you're saying you can put an expert on the stand and the expert will say there was no price impact, and then the plaintiffs have to make the case that there, in fact, was a -- a price impact at the certification stage, that the plaintiffs have to prove that by a preponderance? Once you put a expert on the -- on the stand. Well, that does suggest that the Basic presumption isn't worth much in your world. That you put an expert on the stand, and the Basic presumption falls away, and the plaintiffs have to actually prove their case at that very early stage that there was no price impact.

You're basically saying the judge cannot consider rehabilitation, but the judge can consider educational programs, vocational programs, treatment programs, and so forth. I think most people would think that all of those things are rehabilitation, that there's nothing left over when you say that the judge can consider all of those things. Yes. Well, I'll ask the same question. You're saying they can consider rehabilitation in imposing a sentence, they cannot consider rehabilitation in imposing a sentence, but they can consider all these programs in imposing a sentence. And I'm saying what's the difference between all these programs and rehabilitation? Once you say they -- they can consider all these programs, what's left over that they can't consider? Mr. Bibas, just practically speaking what does this clause instruct a court not to do in your view? Well, really who thought that? This was 1984.

Concepcion,114,Elena Kagan,"I was under the impression-- --I was under the impression, Mr. Pincus, that Discover Bank specifically cites a case which arose not in the arbitration context, but instead in the general litigation context, which is this America Online case, and thereby made clear that its rule, however different it may seem to you from normal contract provisions, its rule applied both in the arbitration sphere and in the litigation sphere. Well, this-- --But Mr. Pincus-- --But, Mr. Pincus, I'm not understanding what test you are asking us to formulate. Justice Scalia started this by saying, how about a provision prohibiting certain kinds of attorney's fees? How about a provision prohibiting certain kinds of -- a law prohibiting certain kinds of discovery provisions? And you said that would be fine, for the State courts to hold those things unconscionable, but it's not fine for the State court to hold a class arbitration prohibition unconscionable. So what separates the two? How do we know when something is on one side of the line and something is on the other? Both procedures, but you say some are fine, to say that those procedures are unconscionable, but other procedures if you held them unconscionable that would not be sufficient. The State says yes. The State says it absolutely is. Now, who are we to say that the State is wrong about that. But, Mr. Pincus, the State says, well, our unconscionability doctrine may not have done that in the past, but now in the year 2010 it actually applies to more things than it did in the past, and we do take into account third parties and that's our new unconscionability doctrine. Now, it may be a good unconscionability doctrine or it may be a bad unconscionability doctrine, but it's the State's unconscionability doctrine. Mr. Gupta, AT&T says that nobody would ever choose class arbitration; it's the worst of both worlds. You get all the procedures, you get broad liability, but at the same time you have no judicial review, so that this will effectively kill off arbitration in the consumer context.

2010,DePierre v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Pincus, if -- if I understand your interpretation correctly, it would exclude freebase. How is that a sensible interpretation of the statute, one that would exclude freebase, a commonly known substance? Congress was aware of it. The Richard Pryor incident had occurred. Everybody knew it was dangerous. Wasn't it at least true that Congress meant to incorporate that substance as well? That means prepared from the powder, in theory-- --is that right? Would it be enough for you if it had the right chemical definition and it was a rock-like substance, just those two things? Would that be enough? If the government could show it has the right chemical definition, it's rock-like, it's solid, does it have to show anything else? I'm asking the same kind of question that Justice Alito is asking, whether the government has to show anything particular to demonstrate that it was prepared from powder cocaine. It's a bizarre term, Ms. Saharsky. It's -- I mean, cocaine base means the same exact same thing as cocaine, because cocaine is a base. It's like referring to an apple by saying ""apple fruit"" or referring to a poodle by saying ""poodle dog"". I mean, it's a strange way to speak about it. It's a strange way to be extra clear, to -- to use a different phrase that's meant to mean the same thing as another phrase. To use two different phrases that are meant to mean the same thing is not a very good way of being clear. But they don't need to do that, Ms. Saharsky. Suppose we just said it needs the right chemical definition, and it's rock-like, rock-like, crystalline, whatever you want to call it. So it's rock-like. It's not a paste; it's not a leaf; it's a rock. But this is -- but this is, Ms. Saharsky, just a strange statute, where you are -- your definition creates all kinds of issues about why it is that Congress used two different phrases to mean the same thing, and then how it is that if they did use two different phrases to mean the same thing, you're effectively reading cocaine out of the statute in Romanette (ii), right? Well, but no, cocaine is the same as cocaine base. So it's like saying -- it's like saying apples, oranges, and bananas cost one dollar; aforesaid apples cost three dollars. That's a strange way to write a statute. But why would it say apples cost one dollar in Romanette (ii) if it was going to say apples cost three dollars in Romanette (iii)?

2010,Fowler v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Crawford, what's your standard? Sometimes you say ""certain""; sometimes you say ""likely""; sometimes you say ""plausible"". Which -- which is your standard? Mr. Crawford, do you think this is right, that the statute says that the person has to prevent the communication to a law enforcement officer? The statute also says that the law enforcement officer, in fact, has to be a Federal law enforcement officer, but because of subsection (g), the statute does not require that the person intend the communication to be to a Federal law enforcement officer, and that's what we're struggling over, correct? And -- and in doing that -- I mean, I guess my question to you is the same as my question to the Government, which is where any of these standards come from. And I agree that the statute does not provide a lot of guidance, but how does one pick between a realistic likelihood or a possibility or a theoretical possibility or any of those things? Mr. Crawford, what would happen if you were dealing with a Federal offense that was a distinctly Federal offense, that really didn't have a State counterpart, like hijacking an airplane? Would that itself be sufficient to support a prosecution under this statute? Is that actually similar to this case? These guys were going to rob a bank, which I take it is mostly prosecuted by Federal officials. Well, where does that reasonable possibility standard come from, Ms. Harrington? Ms. Harrington, what would be -- what would happen if instead of Officer Horner, the custodian of the cemetery had come across these people and the exact same thing had happened, would you then say that there would be -- that there would be a prosecution -- there could be a prosecution under this statute? So is that the difference, that Officer Horner was on his cell phone? So Ms. Harrington, suppose Officer Horner had come to the scene and instead of seeing evidence that there was a robbery about to occur, had seen evidence only of drug use. Now that might be a Federal offense, but typically it wouldn't be prosecuted in -- in a Federal court. Would you say then that the statute is not satisfied? Because? Oh, but that's 4 years later. That was way past the time when this incident occurred. You're saying the fact that they got this information 4 years later, shared it with law enforcement officers after they knew that a murder had occurred as a result of an incident would be the same kind of inquiry that they would make at that time? Before the murder? ",mr crawford what be your standard sometimes you say certain sometimes you say likely sometimes you say plausible which which be your standard mr crawford do you think this be right that the statute say that the person have to prevent the communication to a law enforcement officer the statute also say that the law enforcement officer in fact have to be a federal law enforcement officer but because of subsection g the statute do not require that the person intend the communication to be to a federal law enforcement officer and that be what we be struggle over correct and and in do that i mean i guess my question to you be the same as my question to the government which be where any of these standard come from and i agree that the statute do not provide a lot of guidance but how do one pick between a realistic likelihood or a possibility or a theoretical possibility or any of those thing mr crawford what would happen if you we be deal with a federal offense that be a distinctly federal offense that really do not have a state counterpart like hijack an airplane would that itself be sufficient to support a prosecution under this statute be that actually similar to this case these guy we be go to rob a bank which i take it be mostly prosecute by federal official well where do that reasonable possibility standard come from ms harrington ms harrington what would be what would happen if instead of officer horner the custodian of the cemetery have come across these people and the exact same thing have happen would you then say that there would be that there would be a prosecution there could be a prosecution under this statute so be that the difference that officer horner be on his cell phone so ms harrington suppose officer horner have come to the scene and instead of see evidence that there be a robbery about to occur have see evidence only of drug use now that might be a federal offense but typically it would not be prosecute in in a federal court would you say then that the statute be not satisfy because oh but that be year later that be way past the time when this incident occur you be say the fact that they get this information year later share it with law enforcement officer after they know that a murder have occur as a result of an incident would be the same kind of inquiry that they would make at that time before the murder ,146.48999999999995,Roberts Court,"Mar 29, 2011","Charles Andrew Fowler, aka Man",United States,10-5443,"Nov 15, 2010","May 26, 2011",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2010,Connick v. Thompson,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Duncan, could I give you a hypothetical-- --just to test how strong your position is here. So let's say that there is a new D.A. comes to town and he says, there's going to be one attorney per case from now on and it will be a random assignment system. So sometimes important cases will be tried by experienced attorneys, but sometimes they'll be tried by people right out of law school. And there will be no Brady supervision at all, no Brady training. And there is a closed file system, that we only turn over what we are required to turn over and not anything else. And in addition to that, if I, the D.A., find that you have turned over things that you are not required to turn over, that will be taken into account in your yearly review for promotion purposes, for salary purposes, et cetera. That will be very severely frowned upon. So the new D.A.-- --If you turn over anything that you didn't have to. Okay? If you give any material that you are not required to do by law. And so he puts into place this whole system and says, okay, go to it. And what happens is that there are Brady violations. And there is a Brady violation in a capital case and the person sits on death row, or the person is executed, whichever, and there is a claim brought. Is that claim not a good claim? There is not a pattern, because he just came to town and he just, you know, instituted all these policies, and this is the first Brady violation. But the failure to train or supervise in any way and setting up a structural system that's pretty much guaranteed to produce Brady violations, that would not be enough? In other words, even if the jury said yes, you are liable under that second theory -- not the policy theory, but the failure to train and supervise theory -- that would have to be rejected? Could I add to my hypothetical, then? Suppose that this new district attorney said -- every day he came into the office and he said: I think Brady is just crazy, and I think it's just the worst decision that the Supreme Court has ever issued; and as long as you don't get caught, anything you do is okay by me. It's not a policy. He's just, you know, making his views known around the office. Then the policy is just that you have to turn over what you have to turn over, nothing else, and if you turn over anything else you will get penalized for doing so? That's the policy? Well, don't they make it available? So what would have been enough? I mean, is an hour a year enough? Is an hour a month enough? Mr. Cooney, I'm still confused as to sort of how much is enough by way of training and how you would ask a court or a jury to decide that. You suggested to the Chief Justice formal training wasn't -- isn't necessary if there is some supervision, if there is some mentoring. But, you know, this seems to give cities no sense of what they have to do. No safe harbors. Is that your position? Mr. Duncan, that I think you can't say, because that's just overturning what the jury found. The jury found that there was inadequate training. In fact, the jury found -- I think, if you look at the record -- the jury could have found, a reasonable jury could have found, that there was no training here.

2010,Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, do you actually have studies that show that video games are more harmful to minors than movies are? Suppose a new study suggested that movies were just as violent. Then, presumably, California could regulate movies just as it could regulate video games? Mr. Morazzini, could I take you back to Justice Scalia's original question, which was what counts as deviant violence or morbid violence. Because I read your briefs all the way through and the only thing that I found you said that was clearly covered by this statute was Postal 2. But presumably the statute applies to more than one video game. So what else does it apply to? How many video games? What kind of video games? I mean, how would you describe in plain English what morbid violence is, what you have to see in a video game for it to be covered? So anything that has those kinds of violence counts? Well, so how do we separate violent games that are covered from violent games just as violent that are not covered? So is what is covered here the mature category in the ratings? Is that what this statute covers? Is that what it's meant to cover? Some but not all. So could I just make -- make sure I understand that, Mr. Morazzini, because as I understand the State has given up its argument that the interest protected by this law is an interest in preventing minors who see these games from going out and committing violent acts themselves; that the State is not saying that that's the interest in the law; is that correct? That instead the State is saying that the interest in the law is in protecting children's moral development generally? Well, Mr. Smith, is there any showing that the States could make that would satisfy you, that would say yes, that's a sufficient showing for this law to go forward? You know, I understand that you think that the current studies don't suggest much of anything about harm. But are there studies that would be enough? Mr. Smith, do you think all video games are speech in the first instance? Because you could look at these games and say they're the modern-day equivalent of Monopoly sets. They are games. They are things that people use to compete. You know, when you think about some of them -- the first video game was Pong. It was playing tennis on your TV. How is that speech at all? So are we going to separate video games into narrative video games and non-narrative video games? You think Mortal Combat is prohibited by this statute? It's a candidate, meaning, yes, a reasonable jury could find that Mortal Combat, which is an iconic game, which I am sure half of the clerks who work for us spend considerable amounts of time in their adolescence playing.

2010,Chase Bank USA v. McCoy,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Waxman? Can I ask you about the deference that we should give to the briefs that have been filed in the First Circuit and the invitation brief in this case? Auer deference seems pretty four-square with this. It's a brief that was filed to interpret an agency regulation. But I'm wondering whether Auer continues to remain good law after Christensen and Mead. In Christensen the Court held, and I quote, ""Interpretations such as those in opinion letters, like interpretations contained in policy statements, agency manuals, and enforcement guidelines, all of which lack the force of law, do not warrant Chevron-style deference. "" And Mead said pretty much the same thing. So it seems to me that there are three possibilities for why Auer remains good law. One is that briefs are somehow different from all those other things that we talked about in Christensen. Another is that an agency gets more deference when interpreting regulations than when interpreting its own statutes -- something that I think I just don't quite understand, but maybe you could convince me of it. And a third is, well, look, they are just basically inconsistent, but Auer was Auer and we don't feel like overruling cases, and we're not so sure we got it right in Christensen and Mead anyway. So which is it? Absolutely right, Mr. Waxman, but in each of those cases it was basically a sentence or two. We never really addressed the possible conflict between Auer and Christensen and Mead. But Mead did put a lot of emphasis on procedural formality. So, you know, Justice Scalia sort of snidely, but I think accurately, described Mead as saying: ""Only when agencies act through adjudication, notice and comment rulemaking, or some other procedure indicating comparable congressional intent, whatever that means, is Chevron deference applicable. "" So-- --This is not an adjudication. It's not a notice and comment rulemaking, and it's hard to see why there is some procedure here indicating comparable congressional intent, as Mead would require. Mr. Palmore, what would the Board's position be on the following hypothetical: That a card issuer says when any of 50 different things happen, so 50 different triggering events, the issuer can raise the rate to -- anywhere up to 300 percent, so has complete discretion if any of a quite large number of triggering events occurs. And then one of those 50 triggering events occurs, and the card issuer says, okay, we will raise the interest rate to 42 percent. Would there need to be notice for that? Under the old rule? Mr. Beck, just to clarify your position, if the initial agreement said your rate is 10 percent, but if you are delinquent, your rate will be 20 percent, so not up to 20 percent, just 20 percent, it's an automatic increase in your rate -- in that case, would notice -- would subsequent notice be required? So if you don't need to disclose this, and I think that this is the import of Justice Ginsburg's question-- --what's the difference between going, okay, we will do the initial agreement, 10 percent to 20 percent; then we can always lower the rate without providing notice; we will go back down to 12 percent, and now you have a 12 percent rate. What's the difference between doing that and on the other hand doing what the card issuer said here, which is if you are delinquent, we have the discretion to go up to 20 percent, but you know, we could also go to 12? Mr. Bauer, most of your argument seems to rely on the official staff commentary, but the official staff commentary itself seems to me to cut against you. It says no notice need be given if the specific change is set forth initially. And then it gives examples of what that means. And it says such as, an increase that occurs when the consumer has been under an agreement to maintain a certain balance in a savings account in order to keep a particular rate and the account balance falls below the specified minimum. So the example they give is an example where there is a triggering event and there is a penalty rate that comes into effect as a result of the triggering event. And that is exactly what is true here. Well, on the triggering event first. It's true that you might know your account balance, but it's also true that you might know whether you paid your bills on time. What's the difference? Well, I don't see that in the example that's given. I don't see that it limits it to a situation in which there is an automatic increase in your rate rather than a discretionary increase in your rate. ",mr waxman can i ask you about the deference that we should give to the brief that have be file in the first circuit and the invitation brief in this case auer deference seem pretty four square with this it be a brief that be file to interpret an agency regulation but I be wonder whether auer continue to remain good law after christensen and mead in christensen the court hold and i quote interpretation such as those in opinion letter like interpretation contain in policy statement agency manual and enforcement guideline all of which lack the force of law do not warrant chevron style deference and mead say pretty much the same thing so it seem to me that there be three possibility for why auer remain good law one be that brief be somehow different from all those other thing that we talk about in christensen another be that an agency get more deference when interpret regulation than when interpret its own statute something that i think i just do not quite understand but maybe you could convince me of it and a third be well look they be just basically inconsistent but auer be auer and we do not feel like overrule case and we be not so sure we get it right in christensen and mead anyway so which be it absolutely right mr waxman but in each of those case it be basically a sentence or two we never really address the possible conflict between auer and christensen and mead but mead do put a lot of emphasis on procedural formality so you know justice scalia sort of snidely but i think accurately describe mead as say only when agency act through adjudication notice and comment rulemaking or some other procedure indicate comparable congressional intent whatever that mean be chevron deference applicable so this be not an adjudication it be not a notice and comment rulemaking and it be hard to see why there be some procedure here indicate comparable congressional intent as mead would require mr palmore what would the board s position be on the following hypothetical that a card issuer say when any of different thing happen so different trigger event the issuer can raise the rate to anywhere up to percent so have complete discretion if any of a quite large number of trigger event occurs and then one of those trigger event occurs and the card issuer say okay we will raise the interest rate to percent would there need to be notice for that under the old rule mr beck just to clarify your position if the initial agreement say your rate be percent but if you be delinquent your rate will be percent so not up to percent just percent it be an automatic increase in your rate in that case would notice would subsequent notice be require so if you do not need to disclose this and i think that this be the import of justice ginsburg s question what be the difference between go okay we will do the initial agreement percent to percent then we can always lower the rate without provide notice we will go back down to percent and now you have a percent rate what be the difference between do that and on the other hand do what the card issuer say here which be if you be delinquent we have the discretion to go up to percent but you know we could also go to mr bauer most of your argument seem to rely on the official staff commentary but the official staff commentary itself seem to me to cut against you it say no notice need be give if the specific change be set forth initially and then it give example of what that mean and it say such as an increase that occur when the consumer have be under an agreement to maintain a certain balance in a saving account in order to keep a particular rate and the account balance fall below the specified minimum so the example they give be an example where there be a trigger event and there be a penalty rate that come into effect as a result of the trigger event and that be exactly what be true here well on the trigger event first it be true that you might know your account balance but it be also true that you might know whether you pay your bill on time what be the difference well i do not see that in the example that be give i do not see that it limit it to a situation in which there be an automatic increase in your rate rather than a discretionary increase in your rate ,280.7,Roberts Court,"Dec 8, 2010","Chase Bank USA, N.A.","James A.

2010,Borough of Duryea v. Guarnieri,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Ortiz, can I try a hypothetical on you? Suppose that there is a city employee and unrelated to the fact that he is a city employee the government takes some part of his property without just compensation. And he sues the government, and the government says, somebody says, his employer, that his supervisor said: Do you know what he's just done? He's just sued the city; I think we should fire him. And he brings a retaliation claim. Is that protected under the Petition Clause? Really? What has he done that's protected under the Free Speech Clause? He has brought a suit saying: I'm entitled to just compensation. It seems to me -- the reason I ask is because this seems to me a purely private matter which would not get protection under your test. I see, so that goes back to Justice Scalia's difference test, which is it's not a matter of public concern versus private concern, but it's a matter of employment-related versus not employment-related, correct? Is that correct? Mr. Palmore -- I'm sorry. Suppose a State legislature passes a law depriving all State employees of collective bargaining rights, and a State employee files a lawsuit saying that this law violates the State constitution, and the State employee is thereupon fired. Is that a matter of public concern or not? And suppose -- now going back to Justice Sotomayor's example, suppose that there were a -- a class action alleging systemic discrimination in some governmental workplace. Would that be a matter of public concern? Mr. Palmore, on that matter, one last hypothetical. Suppose the New York City council passed a resolution that said a precinct house would be closed all night long from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m., and the chief of -- of that precinct filed suit saying that this was micromanagement and it was going to affect the public safety of the citizenry, and then that chief of police was fired. Is that a matter of public concern? Well, Mr. Schnapper, can I ask Justice Kennedy's question in maybe a little bit of a different way? In -- in the Connick inquiry, you have a threshold inquiry and then you have a balancing test. Now, you're suggesting that the threshold inquiry, the public concern inquiry, is kind of apples and oranges here; it's just not appropriate for the Petition Clause. But the question that then follows is, should there be a replacement threshold inquiry before you get to the balancing that Connick suggests is the second stage of the process? Mr. Schnapper, isn't the real question in these cases whether the employee is acting as a citizen or instead whether the employee is acting as an employee? And in the speech cases, that distinction suggests a public concern threshold inquiry. Maybe in the petition cases it suggests something else, but that that's really the question we should be asking is, is this employee acting as an employee or as a citizen?

The receiver has done everything he can.

2010,"American Electric Power Co., Inc. v. Connecticut",114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Keisler, the Court did say that, but it's cut off from the Court's actual analysis in the case. When the Court goes through injury and causation and redressability, the Court never refers to the statutory cause of action. But the Court clearly understood that in Massachusetts v. EPA and said that it was enough, and I would think under traditional standing principles the standing there was actually harder to find because one had to go through the EPA first. One had to say the EPA should regulate, and then the EPA would regulate, and then the question was would that reduce emissions levels? Here the EPA is out of the picture. The action is much more direct. Is the consequence of that argument, Mr. Keisler, that there in fact is no Federal common law of interstate pollution claims? But it seems, General Katyal, that there also is no case where we've ever used this language of generalized grievance as a prudential matter rather than as an Article III matter. So am I wrong about that? But Newdow -- Newdow quoted the language of generalized grievance that came from Warth, but it didn't specifically pin anything on that language. Well, General Katyal, how about the Aiken case, because in the Aiken case I think the government came in and made the same argument, that even though the injury was concrete, it was too generalized and therefore there should be no standing, the Court specifically rejected that argument both as to Article III and as to prudential standing. But, General Katyal, suppose that the EPA had decided not to issue the endangerment finding. Would your argument still apply? But if I insisted you answer the hypothetical I gave you, what would the answer be? No endangerment finding. Is there displacement? Do you have a position on whether there's anything to be displaced here? Do you have a position on whether there is, in fact, a Federal cause of action? But I'm sorry, General, because I was understanding your answer differently, and maybe I misheard you, as saying that if there were no legislation here, you doubted that there was a Federal law cause of action. Is that correct? No, but as to whether the cause of action exists under Federal common law in a case like this, where you said it was so different from the other Federal common law cases that the Court has seen. General, could I take you back on that last point to another threshold question, which is the political question doctrine? Because a lot of your arguments really sound like prongs two and three from Baker v. Carr, but you say that we shouldn't go there, that we should instead address this matter on prudential standing grounds. But the political question doctrine actually seems more natural, given the kinds of arguments you're making. So why not? But, General, they're usually facts that are determined by an administrative agency. I mean, even just reading that part of your complaint, it sounds like the paradigmatic thing that administrative agencies do rather than courts. But if there were no and if there were no, we would be living in a different world. There is an administrative agency and there is a Clean Air Act. What if the EPA made a judgment, but it just was not the judgment that you liked? Suppose that the EPA said: We've looked at stationary sources; we're not going to regulate. Would that displace? General, do you think that you have a Federal common law cause of action against anybody in the world? Your briefs talk a lot about how these are the five largest emissions producers, but I saw nothing in your theory to limit it to those five. Is there something that you think limits it to large emissions producers rather than anybody in the world? But, General, much of your argument depends on this notion that this suit is really like any other pollution suit, but all those other pollution suits that you've been talking about are much more localized affairs. One factory emitting discharge into one stream. They don't involve these kinds of national/international policy issues of the kind that this case does. I mean, there's a huge gap, a chasm between the precedents you have and this case, isn't there? ",mr keisler the court do say that but it be cut off from the court s actual analysis in the case when the court go through injury and causation and redressability the court never refer to the statutory because of action but the court clearly understand that in massachusetts v epa and say that it be enough and i would think under traditional standing principles the stand there be actually hard to find because one have to go through the epa first one have to say the epa should regulate and then the epa would regulate and then the question be would that reduce emission level here the epa be out of the picture the action be much more direct be the consequence of that argument mr keisler that there in fact be no federal common law of interstate pollution claim but it seem general katyal that there also be no case where we have ever use this language of generalized grievance as a prudential matter rather than as an article iii matter so be i wrong about that but newdow newdow quote the language of generalized grievance that come from warth but it do not specifically pin anything on that language well general katyal how about the aiken case because in the aiken case i think the government come in and make the same argument that even though the injury be concrete it be too generalized and therefore there should be no standing the court specifically reject that argument both as to article iii and as to prudential standing but general katyal suppose that the epa have decide not to issue the endangerment finding would your argument still apply but if i insist you answer the hypothetical i give you what would the answer be no endangerment finding be there displacement do you have a position on whether there be anything to be displace here do you have a position on whether there be in fact a federal because of action but I be sorry general because i be understand your answer differently and maybe i misheard you as say that if there we be no legislation here you doubt that there be a federal law because of action be that correct no but as to whether the because of action exists under federal common law in a case like this where you say it be so different from the other federal common law case that the court have see general could i take you back on that last point to another threshold question which be the political question doctrine because a lot of your argument really sound like prong two and three from baker v carr but you say that we should not go there that we should instead address this matter on prudential stand ground but the political question doctrine actually seem more natural give the kind of argument you be make so why not but general they be usually fact that be determine by an administrative agency i mean even just read that part of your complaint it sound like the paradigmatic thing that administrative agency do rather than court but if there we be no and if there we be no we would be live in a different world there be an administrative agency and there be a clean air act what if the epa make a judgment but it just be not the judgment that you like suppose that the epa say we have look at stationary source we be not go to regulate would that displace general do you think that you have a federal common law because of action against anybody in the world your brief talk a lot about how these be the five large emission producer but i saw nothing in your theory to limit it to those five be there something that you think limit it to large emission producer rather than anybody in the world but general much of your argument depend on this notion that this suit be really like any other pollution suit but all those other pollution suit that you have be talk about be much more localized affair one factory emit discharge into one stream they do not involve these kind of nationalinternational policy issue of the kind that this case do i mean there be a huge gap a chasm between the precedent you have and this case be not there ,221.16000000000003,Roberts Court,"Apr 19, 2011","American Electric Power Company Inc., et al.","Connecticut, et al.",10-174,"Dec 6, 2010","Jun 20, 2011",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

When does the State think, okay, that's too late? Well, I'm trying to get to even around, not -- not exact. My standard is not exact. It's just around. Around what? Around 6 months, around 3 years, around someplace in the middle? What happens if a -- a person in this position is trying to investigate multiple claims at once, and some of them are ready to be put before the court and others are not? How does he know, look, I really better get in there right now and put whatever I have before the Court; or look, I have a little bit more time in order to investigate some of my claims further? How does he make that determination? Why is it, Mr. Marshall, that the -- the California courts have not been a little bit more transparent about what the presumptive time limits are? You know, look, it's around a year unless have you a good reason. You know, at least we are taking 3 years off the table. I mean, why don't we have decisions like that from the California courts that would -- would help folks here? Mr. Bigelow, is that right? I take your point that nobody can say exactly when Mr. Martin's claims became untimely, but five years is untimely, isn't it? If there is a very good reason, but five years without an explanation is -- why is that a hard question? Why was this petition not filed for 5 years? Why -- why was this petition not filed for 5 years? Mr. Bigelow, isn't this similar to the rule that governed Federal habeas review prior to AEDPA? A similar kind of delay standard, whatever ""delay"" means? ",when do the state think that mr martin s claim become untimely so you think it but if we can take out the second and successive aspect of this and just focus on the timeliness when do the state think that this that these claim become untimely well you have the circumstance here so under those circumstance when do the claim become untimely the month would be reasonable so be a year unreasonable be month the outer bound you know assume you do not have a good reason i understand that if you have a good reason that can lengthen it but suppose you do not have a good reason when do the state think okay that be too late well I be try to get to even around not not exact my standard be not exact it be just around around what around month around year around someplace in the middle what happen if a a person in this position be try to investigate multiple claim at once and some of them be ready to be put before the court and others be not how do he know look i really good get in there right now and put whatever i have before the court or look i have a little bit more time in order to investigate some of my claim far how do he make that determination why be it mr marshall that the the california court have not be a little bit more transparent about what the presumptive time limit be you know look it be around a year unless have you a good reason you know at least we be take year off the table i mean why do not we have decision like that from the california court that would would help folks here mr bigelow be that right i take your point that nobody can say exactly when mr martin s claim become untimely but five year be untimely be not it if there be a very good reason but five year without an explanation be why be that a hard question why be this petition not file for year why why be this petition not file for year mr bigelow be not this similar to the rule that govern federal habeas review prior to aedpa a similar kind of delay standard whatever delay mean ,146.86,Roberts Court,"Nov 29, 2010","James Walker, Warden, et al.",Charles W.

2010,Sykes v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Marsh, I take it that you would agree that (b)(1)(B) is a violent felony under -- under ACCA; is that right? Well, if we think that (b)(1)(B) is a violent felony under ACCA and we know that (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) can receive the same punishment, that they're both classed as a class D felony, why should we make the distinction between the two under ACCA? But these are not nested offenses. These are not -- these are not lesser included offenses. Each has an element that the other lacks, and both are classed with -- apparently that the -- that the State thinks of them as equally severe. And if one is a violent felony under ACCA, there's an argument that the other should be treated in the exact same way. Well, Mr. Wall, wouldn't that suggest that if I just ran from a police officer, it would be a violent felony under ACCA? Mr. Wall, do you think that speeding or drag racing qualifies under your understanding of the test? But Mr. Wall, suppose they were? I understand your point that they're not, and you might be right about that. But let's suppose that they were. Let's suppose you had a three-tier set-up. One was simple flight; one was flight that causes risk of injury; one that is a flight that causes injury. And let's even say that the simple flight -- no, let's -- let's call them all felonies, but different classes of felonies. What would happen in that case? Would you still be here saying that the simple flight felony is a violent crime? I -- I asked my clerk to just do a survey of the States, and he came up with -- and I'm sure that this is rough -- but that 46 of the States have these tiered systems. Now, there may be some questions as to some of them, like you've raised some questions about Indiana's, but that 46 States essentially conceive of this as two different kinds of conduct, one which is the violent kind and the other which is the not violent crime. Well, on this question of whether this statute is greater or lesser, it's greater or lesser if you just understand (b)(1)(A) as confined to vehicular flight. In other words, if one looks only at vehicular flight, then (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) are indeed greater or lesser offenses. Do you think that if I flee in a vehicle, I could be prosecuted under both and receive sentences under both? But as a vehicular flight only, it would be greater or lesser.

2010,"Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano",114,Elena Kagan,"Well, Mr. Hacker, you were saying that the question of whether there is support is reducible to the question of whether there are statistically significant findings. Now, as I understand it, the FDA takes action all the time as to drugs -- they force the withdrawal of a drug from the market, they force relabeling of a drug -- on the basis of findings that are not statistically significant. Now, clearly in those cases the market has a right to know the very things that are going to make the FDA take action against a product and that are going to severely affect the product's value to the company. Not statistical significance there. Well, it could and eventually it did. And you are suggesting a test for what -- what counts as material, which is statistically significant, a test that the FDA itself doesn't use when it thinks about what it should what it should regulate. In most cases we don't know whether the claim is false or not. So let me give you a hypothetical. There's a pharmaceutical company and it comes out with its first and only product, it's 100 percent of the sales, and it's a new contact lens solution. And it sells this product to many, many, many hundreds of thousands of people. And most of them use this product with no adverse effect whatsoever, but there are ten cases where somebody uses this product and they go blind. Three of those ten cases, the person had to borrow a contact lens from a friend, only used it in one eye, they go blind only in that one eye. This is not statistically significant. There is no way that anybody would tell that you these ten cases are statistically significant. Would you stop using that product and would a reasonable investor want to know about those ten cases? There are a lot of contact lens solutions in the world. So if I heard that, ten people went blind, three used it in one eye, three went blind in that eye, I'd stop using the product; and if I were holding stock in that company, I would sell the stock. But Mr. Frederick, suppose you are the CEO of a pharmaceutical company with a new drug, you've just put it back on the market, and you get a report back, this drug has caused a death, right? This is your first adverse effect report. Do you have to disclose it? Mr. Shah, what deference do you think that the SEC's understanding of materiality it's entitled to and why?

2010,General Dynamics Corp. v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Phillips, could I ask you whether that principle makes any sense in this contracting situation, because both parties have argued it as though the question of who is the moving party is determinative of this case, but in a contract situation the question of who's the moving party is very often arbitrary or fortuitous. If you think about it in a private setting, you have one contract, one contractor who fails to perform or -- or provides some deficient product, another who decides it's not going to pay, and the question of who the plaintiff is, is often just a matter of fortuity, who gets to the courthouse first-- --what the payment schedule has been like, so whether somebody is demanding their money back or simply refusing to pay it at all. So, why in this contract situation is the question of who's the plaintiff or who's the moving party, why does -- why does that make such a difference? But it can't possibly be the case that the question is what the payment schedule is. If I've paid you already and then I find your product deficient, then I'm going to go to court and demand my money back. If I find your product deficient before I pay you, then you are going to go to court and say, you have to pay me. So why should that difference make a difference with respect to the constitutional question before us? Both parties have a claim here. One says you provided deficient performance; the other says you were obligated to pay me. The question of who has the claim and who has the affirmative defense, it can be structured in either way. So just to make sure I understand your argument, suppose that state secrets had prevented you from being able to prove your default claim, that you were unable to make that showing because of state secrets. What would happen then? That-- --That's right, that the secrets that you wanted to protect were actually the -- the key to your proving that there was a default. Let me make sure I understand, because that really does sound like a tails you win, heads you win, whatever. You're saying that if the state secrets prevented you from making your affirmative case, you should win that one, too? Mr. Phillips, I understood your papers as making only a constitutional claim.

2010,"Ransom v. FIA Card Services, N.A.",114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Burke, if we could stay with this. The $471 is derived by looking at the average loan or lease payments nationwide. Then in addition to that we know that the IRS has a separate category for operating costs that is meant to reflect costs of having a car that are not your loan and lease payments. So between those two things, why wouldn't we say that ownership costs means your loan and lease payments, but operating costs means your other costs of having a car, and that you get the operating costs if you have a car but don't make loan and lease payments and you get the ownership costs if you do make loan and lease payments? For example, Mr. Burke, what would happen if you didn't actually have any out-of-pocket medical costs? Could you still claim a deduction for out-of-pocket medical costs? But, Mr. Burke, even you would say -- is this correct -- that if you don't own a car at all you can't claim the car costs? But, Mr. Burke, if the table said loan and lease costs, you wouldn't have a case?

Ms. Saharsky, could you explain to me the Government's position on when a debtor with loan and lease payments gets to deduct them under Romanette II? In other words, this goes back to Justice Kennedy's question, the notwithstanding clause and whether the notwithstanding clause effectively excludes all loan and lease payments from Romanette II?

2010,CIGNA v. Amara,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, Mr. Olson, we have several times referred to the plan as having a range of documents associated with it, not as having just a single written instrument, but we referred to documents and instruments governing the plan. We did that in Curtiss-Wright, which is the case that you pin so much on. We did that in Kennedy. And the statute itself talks about that on numerous occasions, that there are documents and instruments, in the plural, and one would think that the SPD is -- is one of those documents and instruments that govern the plan. Well, I was struck by something else, Mr. Olson. I was struck by the fact that the -- that the statute saying what is in the summary plan description is packed with information that needs to be in the summary plan description. By contrast, the written instrument, which you equate to the plan, the written instrument says barely anything about what has to be in it. It just says the name of the fiduciaries has to be in the written instrument. So it seems clear that this statute is set up so that everything that is important, everything that the employee needs to know and needs to rely upon, is supposed to be in the SPD, not necessarily in the written instrument. But can't the SPD-- --But, Mr. Olson, what about the opposite? Because the statute seems to be written so that things are in the SPD which don't need to be in the written instrument. And together, they all somehow constitute the plan. But the SPD can't negate the force of ERISA, and if ERISA says that the summary has to be consistent with the plan documents nothing in the SPD can negate that requirement. But the very question here is if there is an SPD that is inconsistent in some way with the written instrument, what happens? Is the written instrument modified or instead is the provision in the SPD given operative effect? And that question is one about your benefits under the plan. I do think you are over-reading Curtiss-Wright. Curtiss -- Wright talked about whether a particular provision satisfied the requirement that a plan have an amendment provision. It didn't say anything at all about whether there are provisions that can have operative effect regardless of whether they pass through a formal amendment procedure. Mr. Kneedler, do you view this as essentially a contract case, as that just suggested, or instead a trust case? Mr. Kneedler, I think it's a hard question here as to whether to think of this as more like a contract dispute or more like a -- a trust issue. If we were to look at it as a trust issue, what would be the result of that? What kind of test would we use? Mr. Olson, on your view of showing detrimental reliance, I take it you would require each employee to come forward and say yes, I read this SPD, is that correct? And doesn't that really misunderstand the realities of the workplace?

2010,Fox v. Vice,114,Elena Kagan,"And Mr. Rosenkranz, in this case what's your understanding of the approximate percentage of time that was spent on the Federal issues that Justice Ginsburg was talking about? So there was no significant motions practice on these issues? There was no particular discovery on issues of State action and so forth? Mr. Stancil, can I get you to just think about a hypothetical with me? There's a plaintiff and he files a suit and it has a State claim and a Federal claim; and the Federal claim is a really bad claim, it's frivolous; and it eventually gets tossed out, and it's -- it's labeled frivolous. But the State claim is a really good claim and it wins, all right? The plaintiff has requested $100,000 and the plaintiff gets $100,000 because he's won on the State claim. Now, here are the legal fees. The legal fees are 20 percent was incurred solely for the State claim, 20 percent was incurred solely for the Federal claim, and 60 percent was incurred in both because there were overlapping issues and it's just impossible to tear them apart. What are the fees in that case according to you? Okay. So -- but -- so in other words, you're saying he gets all the work, the defendant gets the work done on the Federal claim notwithstanding that the plaintiff has gotten his entire relief; is that right? All the work that is-- --Even though the plaintiff has, from the plaintiff's view has completely won the lawsuit. Go-- --No. Go ahead. And -- and -- okay, go ahead, I'm sorry. So but on that theory, the -- the plaintiff would be paying the defendant's fees for work done where the plaintiff won. Well, what percentage of the work done has actually been useful to you in defending the State court claims, approximate?

2010,Kentucky v. King,114,Elena Kagan,"But I don't understand why the smell of marijuana is necessary. This goes back to what Justice Sotomayor was saying, you don't need probable cause to knock on a door. Knocking on a door is perfectly lawful. So, if there's just a lawfulness test, the knock is fine. And then when you hear whatever it is that you hear that you think creates exigent circumstances, whether it's a toilet flushing or whether it's just noise, that too gives you the ability to go right in. So -- so if it's just lawfulness, you don't need the marijuana smell even, do you? Probable cause beyond thinking that the evidence-- --is being destroyed? Okay. Ms. O'Connell, if I could ask you about the government's proposed standard: You say that as long as each step in the police conduct is lawful, that's sufficient, and each step would -- the way the Fourth Amendment works, each step, we're asking, essentially, whether each step is reasonable. What some courts have done in addition to that -- and this was not the approach of the court below -- but what some courts have done is to say, we also ask a more holistic reasonableness question. We say: Is the whole process by which the police operated with respect to this person reasonable? So, for example, we might say, you know: Was there time to get a warrant or did it look like the police were just -- they preferred not to have to deal with a magistrate? So what's wrong with that sort of standard? In addition to asking whether each step is reasonable, to say: Look, is the whole pattern here of what the police did to come up with this evidence reasonable? Well, Ms. Drake if that's the case, in some way you're agreeing with the government. You, too, are saying that -- that there's a lawfulness test. You're just disagree about what's lawful. Mr. Farley, one of the points of the Fourth Amendment is to ensure that when people search your home, they have a warrant, and of course there are exceptions to that. But if there is one place where the warrant requirement has real force, it's in the home. And I think that the concern here, and you have some strong arguments on your side, but the concern here is that your test is going to enable the police to penetrate the home, to search the home, without a warrant, without going to see a magistrate, in a very wide variety of cases, that all the police really have to say is: We saw pot, we heard noise. Or: We think there was some criminal activity going on for whatever reason and we heard noise. How do you prevent that from happening? How do you prevent your test from essentially eviscerating the warrant requirement in the context of the one place that the Fourth Amendment was most concerned about? ",but i do not understand why the smell of marijuana be necessary this go back to what justice sotomayor be say you do not need probable because to knock on a door knock on a door be perfectly lawful so if there be just a lawfulness test the knock be fine and then when you hear whatever it be that you hear that you think creates exigent circumstance whether it be a toilet flushing or whether it be just noise that too give you the ability to go right in so so if it be just lawfulness you do not need the marijuana smell even do you probable because beyond thinking that the evidence be be destroy okay ms oconnell if i could ask you about the government s proposed standard you say that as long as each step in the police conduct be lawful that be sufficient and each step would the way the fourth amendment work each step we be ask essentially whether each step be reasonable what some court have do in addition to that and this be not the approach of the court below but what some court have do be to say we also ask a more holistic reasonableness question we say be the whole process by which the police operate with respect to this person reasonable so for example we might say you know be there time to get a warrant or do it look like the police we be just they prefer not to have to deal with a magistrate so what be wrong with that sort of standard in addition to ask whether each step be reasonable to say look be the whole pattern here of what the police do to come up with this evidence reasonable well ms drake if that be the case in some way you be agree with the government you too be say that that there be a lawfulness test you be just disagree about what be lawful mr farley one of the point of the fourth amendment be to ensure that when people search your home they have a warrant and of course there be exception to that but if there be one place where the warrant requirement have real force it be in the home and i think that the concern here and you have some strong argument on your side but the concern here be that your test be go to enable the police to penetrate the home to search the home without a warrant without go to see a magistrate in a very wide variety of case that all the police really have to say be we saw pot we hear noise or we think there be some criminal activity go on for whatever reason and we hear noise how do you prevent that from happen how do you prevent your test from essentially eviscerate the warrant requirement in the context of the one place that the fourth amendment be most concerned about ,162.40000000000003,Roberts Court,"Jan 12, 2011",Kentucky,Hollis Deshaun King,09-1272,"Sep 28, 2010","May 16, 2011",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2010,Snyder v. Phelps,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Summers-- --Mr. Summers, Hustler seems to me to have one sentence that is key to the whole decision, and it goes like this. It says: ""Outrageousness in the area of political and social discourse has an inherent subjectiveness about it which would allow a jury to impose liability on the basis of the jurors' tastes or views or perhaps on the basis of their dislike of a particular expression. "" How does that sentence -- how is that sentence less implicated, in a case about a private figure than in a case about a public figure? But that goes back to the question that was asked previously about, suppose you had a general statute that just said, there will be no disruptions of any kind at private funerals. You know, pick your distance, 500 feet, 1,000 feet, but something that didn't refer to content, that didn't refer to ideas, that just made it absolutely clear that people could not disrupt private funerals. What harm would that statute not address in your case? Ms. Phelps, suppose -- suppose your group or another group or -- picks a wounded soldier and follows him around, demonstrates at his home, demonstrates at his workplace, demonstrates at his church, basically saying a lot of the things that were on these signs or -- or other offensive and outrageous things, and just follows this person around, day-to-day. Does that person not have a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress? Demonstrations outside the person's home, outside the person's workplace, outside the person's church -- demonstrations, not disruptions, but saying these kinds of things: You are a war criminal, you -- what -- would -- whatever these signs say or worse? Well, Ms. Phelps, let's say that we disagree with you as to whether Mr. Snyder had at all injected himself into this controversy. Or let's take a case where it's clear that the father of the fallen soldier had not injected himself, had not called any newspapers, had not said anything to anybody, but a group knew that this funeral was taking place, and was there with the same signs, with the same -- are you -- are you saying that that makes the difference? That there, there would be a claim? So it's not a difference that matters. Mr. Summers, could I ask you to go back to an answer that you gave to one of my colleagues when you were last up there? You said that a -- a more standard antiwar demonstration, ""get out of Iraq"", ""war is immoral"", at this funeral, same distance, same sized signs -- that a more standard antiwar demonstration would be protected by the First Amendment from an intentional infliction of emotional distress suit. And I'm wondering why that is. If you think that what is -- what causes the lack of protection here is the kind of glomming to a private funeral, the exploitation of a private person's grief, the -- the appearance for no other reason than to gain publicity at a private event -- if that's the problem, why doesn't it also apply to a standard, you know, ""get out of Iraq"", ""war is wrong"", kind of demonstration? Well, suppose it is not disrupted and suppose -- and I know you that this is, that contest these facts -- that yours wasn't disrupted, that they stopped when you started, that they were a sufficient number of feet away from the funeral and so forth. So we are just talking the fact that there are people who have -- who are appropriating and taking advantage of a private funeral in order to express their views, and they are in compliance with all of the content-neutral rules. But why is it a closer call? So does that mean that now we have to start reading each sign, and saying ""war is wrong"" falls on one side of the line but ""you are a war criminal"" falls on another side of the line? Is that what we would have to do? Well, that's true, but I was assuming a situation in which a jury found that the war was wrong, that a jury did find that outrageous; and the question was were we going to reverse the jury verdict because we -- the First Amendment prohibited it? ",mr summer mr summer hustler seem to me to have one sentence that be key to the whole decision and it go like this it say outrageousness in the area of political and social discourse have an inherent subjectiveness about it which would allow a jury to impose liability on the basis of the juror taste or view or perhaps on the basis of their dislike of a particular expression how do that sentence how be that sentence less implicate in a case about a private figure than in a case about a public figure but that go back to the question that be ask previously about suppose you have a general statute that just say there will be no disruption of any kind at private funeral you know pick your distance foot foot but something that do not refer to content that do not refer to idea that just make it absolutely clear that people could not disrupt private funeral what harm would that statute not address in your case ms phelps suppose suppose your group or another group or pick a wounded soldier and follow him around demonstrate at his home demonstrate at his workplace demonstrate at his church basically say a lot of the thing that we be on these sign or or other offensive and outrageous thing and just follow this person around day to day do that person not have a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress demonstration outside the person s home outside the person s workplace outside the person s church demonstration not disruption but say these kind of thing you be a war criminal you what would whatever these sign say or bad well ms phelps let us say that we disagree with you as to whether mr snyder have at all inject himself into this controversy or let us take a case where it be clear that the father of the fall soldier have not inject himself have not call any newspaper have not say anything to anybody but a group know that this funeral be take place and be there with the same sign with the same be you be you say that that make the difference that there there would be a claim so it be not a difference that matter mr summer could i ask you to go back to an answer that you give to one of my colleague when you we be last up there you say that a a more standard antiwar demonstration get out of iraq war be immoral at this funeral same distance same size sign that a more standard antiwar demonstration would be protect by the first amendment from an intentional infliction of emotional distress suit and I be wonder why that be if you think that what be what cause the lack of protection here be the kind of glom to a private funeral the exploitation of a private person s grief the the appearance for no other reason than to gain publicity at a private event if that be the problem why do not it also apply to a standard you know get out of iraq war be wrong kind of demonstration well suppose it be not disrupt and suppose and i know you that this be that contest these fact that yours be not disrupt that they stop when you start that they we be a sufficient number of foot away from the funeral and so forth so we be just talk the fact that there be people who have who be appropriate and take advantage of a private funeral in order to express their view and they be in compliance with all of the content neutral rule but why be it a closer call so do that mean that now we have to start read each sign and say war be wrong fall on one side of the line but you be a war criminal fall on another side of the line be that what we would have to do well that be true but i be assume a situation in which a jury find that the war be wrong that a jury do find that outrageous and the question be we be we go to reverse the jury verdict because we the first amendment prohibit it ,274.42,Roberts Court,"Oct 6, 2010",Albert Snyder,"Fred W.

Does general jurisdiction go beyond State of incorporation, principal place of business? Mr. Horwich, could I ask you a different kind of question, and I apologize in advanced for taking you a little bit far afield? But -- but I wanted to ask you about a particular sentence in your brief that seems to have some relevance to, not the general jurisdiction question but some relevance to specific jurisdiction. So this is on page 20.

Am I reading that correctly? No, I was hoping that the answer would be yes, actually. [Laughter] This is just a -- this is an I'm-just-curious question: Why do you care?

2010,Smith v. Bayer Corp.,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, Mr. Monahan, do you mean by that that you would have a blanket rule that a decision on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 can never be preclusive as to a State Rule of Civil Procedure 23? Well, suppose the State says: We will not consider ourselves bound; we do have our own law with respect to Rule 23, but sometimes we'll go along with the Federal rule and sometimes we won't. Is it then up to the courts to actually try to determine whether the -- the West Virginia court in this case would have gone along, would have interpreted its own rule of civil procedure the same way that the Federal Court interpreted the Federal rule? When -- when Congress enacted CAFA, did Congress think about this precise issue, the issue that Justice Ginsburg is raising about a lawyer going from State to State with a different named plaintiff? Was that -- was that part of what Congress was reacting to? When you said on that issue, Mr. Beck, on what issue, because I think that there is an argument in this case that the West Virginia approach to class certification is different from the Eighth Circuit's approach, that Rezulin would not have been the way that the Eighth Circuit would have approached the class certification question. Mr. Beck, I'm -- I'm not sure that White answers the question that I asked, because White decided a matter of substantive liability, and the question I asked was whether the approach to class certification was different in the Eighth Circuit and in West Virginia. If you look at Rezulin, if you compare to it some Eighth Circuit cases, there seems to be a difference in at least tone, shall we say, about the extent to which a finding is required that common issues predominate. Mr. Beck, the relitigation exception of the Anti-Injunction Act speaks in terms of judgments. Why is the denial of class certification a judgment? But the judgment, if I understood it correctly, there was just a contemporaneous summary judgment motion, and the court granted summary judgment as well. But the denial of class certification isn't responsible for the judge's dismissal of the suit. So that sounds like a very contingent answer to my question. If that were not the case, if it -- if there was the denial of a class certification, but then the action proceeds as a non-class litigation, you think that there would be no judgment, and so the Anti-Injunction Act would not apply? Oh, but why isn't it really, because here what happened was that there was a denial of class certification and there was a granting of a summary judgment motion at one and the same time? But the thing that was responsible for getting the case out of court was the granting of the summary judgment motion, not the denial of class certification. That was extraneous to the judgment that the case was dismissed. ",well mr monahan do you mean by that that you would have a blanket rule that a decision on federal rule of civil procedure can never be preclusive as to a state rule of civil procedure well suppose the state say we will not consider ourselves bound we do have our own law with respect to rule but sometimes we will go along with the federal rule and sometimes we will not be it then up to the court to actually try to determine whether the the west virginia court in this case would have go along would have interpret its own rule of civil procedure the same way that the federal court interpret the federal rule when when congress enact cafa do congress think about this precise issue the issue that justice ginsburg be raise about a lawyer go from state to state with a different name plaintiff be that be that part of what congress be react to when you say on that issue mr beck on what issue because i think that there be an argument in this case that the west virginia approach to class certification be different from the eighth circuit s approach that rezulin would not have be the way that the eighth circuit would have approach the class certification question mr beck I be I be not sure that white answer the question that i ask because white decide a matter of substantive liability and the question i ask be whether the approach to class certification be different in the eighth circuit and in west virginia if you look at rezulin if you compare to it some eighth circuit case there seem to be a difference in at least tone shall we say about the extent to which a finding be require that common issue predominate mr beck the relitigation exception of the anti injunction act speak in term of judgment why be the denial of class certification a judgment but the judgment if i understand it correctly there be just a contemporaneous summary judgment motion and the court grant summary judgment as well but the denial of class certification be not responsible for the judge s dismissal of the suit so that sound like a very contingent answer to my question if that we be not the case if it if there be the denial of a class certification but then the action proceeds as a non class litigation you think that there would be no judgment and so the anti injunction act would not apply oh but why be not it really because here what happen be that there be a denial of class certification and there be a granting of a summary judgment motion at one and the same time but the thing that be responsible for get the case out of court be the granting of the summary judgment motion not the denial of class certification that be extraneous to the judgment that the case be dismiss ,174.03,Roberts Court,"Jan 18, 2011","Keith Smith, et al.",Bayer Corp.,09-1205,"Sep 28, 2010","Jun 16, 2011",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2010,Bond v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Clement, in the case before us, are you making any claims other than that Congress was acting outside its enumerated powers in enacting this statute? Are there any peculiarly Tenth Amendment claims that you're making? In other words, you admit that Congress is acting within its enumerated powers and yet the action violates the Tenth Amendment. Are you making any claims of that sort, or are all your claims that the statute here goes beyond Congress's ability to enact it under Article I? Well, let's just use the Printz case and say, even though Congress might have the ability to enact a statute under Article I, there's an independent Tenth Amendment limitation. Do you have any claims of that kind in this case? Well, let's assume, Mr. Clement, that there is such a thing as a claim in which you're saying, I can see that this is within Congress's Article I powers, but there is an independent Tenth Amendment limitation on this. Do you have any claims like that? Mr. Clement, if you are not making a commandeering claim, then we would be going out of our way to decide that question. And so, you know, are you making a commandeering claim? Well, Mr. Dreeben, why shouldn't the defendant be able to raise that argument? If the defendant prevails on that argument, presumably the statute is invalidated and the conviction is overthrown. So why doesn't the defendant have the appropriate interest to raise that argument? But that's a merits question. That's not a standing question. Why don't we just say the defendant has standing to raise it, and then he'll lose? Mr. McAllister, I guess I don't understand why that makes a difference. The Necessary and Proper Clause says ""foregoing powers"" and it says ""other powers"". This happens to be a case where Congress is acting under the other powers part of the Necessary and Proper Clause, but the question in either event is the extent of the Necessary and Proper Clause and what it allows Congress to do. So in -- in that sense, whether it's a treaty power case or not a treaty power case just doesn't matter.

Suppose that there were, in fact, no deterrent effect on your speech or on the speech of any candidate; in other words, that people thought, well, you know, I would rather be -- have me be the only person who talks, but -- but I would rather talk than be silent, even if it means my opponent can talk, too, so that there's no deterrent effect from this law whatsoever. Would there still be a constitutional objection? Well, it constitutes a substantial burden, so even if every single person makes a choice, yes, I want to continue to speak, it does not chill any speak -- any speech. I suppose I'm not sure what it means to constitute a substantial burden if, in fact, the law does not chill speech. But, in fact, there's no such restriction here, is there, Mr. Maurer? There's no restriction at all here; it's more speech all the way around? Well, doesn't the government actually just give a selective subsidy? It's not a penalty, it's just saying, in order to -- to run an effective public financing system, when you speak, we're going to give a subsidy over a certain amount. So the trigger does not trigger a penalty; it triggers a subsidy. There is, though, a significant difference between Davis and this case. What the expenditure triggered in Davis was a discriminatory restriction that would never be allowed in and of itself. What the law triggers here is something that, as Justice Ginsburg said, the government could do from the get-go, which is subsidize the speech of a candidate who decides to participate in a public financing system. But there's no particular as-applied challenge from independent speakers in this lawsuit, is there? My -- my understanding was that the suit was brought as a facial challenge to the entire law. But that's interesting, Mr. Maurer, because I don't see all that much of a difference between Justice Alito's hypothetical and the facts here. In other words, you said that Justice Alito's hypothetical would be constitutional, even though under Justice Alito's hypothetical the State is trying to figure out how much money it takes to run a competitive race and giving people who enter the public financing system that amount of money. That's exactly what the State is doing here, but it's doing it in actually a more accurate way. So if Justice Alito's hypothetical is constitutional, why isn't this? They're both trying to do the same thing, which is to put sufficient money in the hands of people who enter the public financing system in order to run a competitive race. Well, I think, to the contrary, in Justice Alito's hypothetical, just the State is estimating how much a person will spend. Here the State is measuring how much a person will spend. The only difference is that one is more accurate than the other. I think the purpose of this law is to prevent corruption. That's what the purpose of all public financing systems are. Well, Mr. Maurer, some people may use certain buzz words and other people don't use those buzz words, but isn't it true that for 40 years what public financing systems have been based upon is the idea that when there is a lot of private money floating around the political system, that candidates and then public office holders get beholden to various people who are giving that money and make actions based on how much they receive from those people, and that's the idea of a public financing system is to try to prevent that? Mr. Maurer, Davis starts off by saying that if what had been triggered was not an inequitable contribution limit raised but instead both a contribution raised for both candidates, that would have been perfectly appropriate, notwithstanding that that would have put many independent funders to a real choice. The independent funder says, well, I'm not taking any contributions, so that's only going to help my opponent. What's the difference in that case? Well, as I said, the Davis system that was -- the system that was specifically approved in Davis would disincentivize many people, many independent funders from speaking, would put that person to a choice of the kind that you say that your clients are being put to a choice, the exact same kind of choice. ",could i try to understand that argument a little bit well mr maurer suppose and i know that you think this be not the case but just bear with the hypothetical suppose that there we be in fact no deterrent effect on your speech or on the speech of any candidate in other word that people think well you know i would rather be have me be the only person who talk but but i would rather talk than be silent even if it mean my opponent can talk too so that there be no deterrent effect from this law whatsoever would there still be a constitutional objection well it constitute a substantial burden so even if every single person make a choice yes i want to continue to speak it do not chill any speak any speech i suppose I be not sure what it mean to constitute a substantial burden if in fact the law do not chill speech but in fact there be no such restriction here be there mr maurer there be no restriction at all here it be more speech all the way around well do not the government actually just give a selective subsidy it be not a penalty it be just say in order to to run an effective public financing system when you speak we be go to give a subsidy over a certain amount so the trigger do not trigger a penalty it trigger a subsidy there be though a significant difference between davis and this case what the expenditure trigger in davis be a discriminatory restriction that would never be allow in and of itself what the law trigger here be something that as justice ginsburg say the government could do from the get go which be subsidize the speech of a candidate who decide to participate in a public financing system but there be no particular as applied challenge from independent speaker in this lawsuit be there my my understanding be that the suit be bring as a facial challenge to the entire law but that be interesting mr maurer because i do not see all that much of a difference between justice alito s hypothetical and the fact here in other word you say that justice alito s hypothetical would be constitutional even though under justice alito s hypothetical the state be try to figure out how much money it take to run a competitive race and give people who enter the public financing system that amount of money that be exactly what the state be do here but it be do it in actually a more accurate way so if justice alito s hypothetical be constitutional why be not this they be both try to do the same thing which be to put sufficient money in the hand of people who enter the public financing system in order to run a competitive race well i think to the contrary in justice alito s hypothetical just the state be estimate how much a person will spend here the state be measure how much a person will spend the only difference be that one be more accurate than the other i think the purpose of this law be to prevent corruption that be what the purpose of all public financing system be well mr maurer some people may use certain buzz word and other people do not use those buzz word but be not it true that for year what public financing system have be base upon be the idea that when there be a lot of private money float around the political system that candidate and then public office holder get behold to various people who be give that money and make action base on how much they receive from those people and that be the idea of a public financing system be to try to prevent that mr maurer davis start off by say that if what have be trigger be not an inequitable contribution limit raise but instead both a contribution raise for both candidate that would have be perfectly appropriate notwithstanding that that would have put many independent funders to a real choice the independent funder say well I be not take any contribution so that be only go to help my opponent what be the difference in that case well as i say the davis system that be the system that be specifically approve in davis would disincentivize many people many independent funders from speaking would put that person to a choice of the kind that you say that your client be be put to a choice the exact same kind of choice ,249.47,Roberts Court,"Mar 28, 2011","Arizona Free Enterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC, et al.","Ken Bennett, in His Official Capacity as Arizona Secretary of State, et al.",10-238,"Nov 29, 2010","Jun 27, 2011",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2010,Camreta v. Greene,114,Elena Kagan,"General Kroger, I don't think that the question here is really a standing question; it's really whether there is a controversy between this particular plaintiff and this particular defendant such that a judgment in this case would actually affect the legal relationship between the two, between the particular plaintiff and the particular defendant. So how would it do that? How would a legal judgment in this case affect the legal relationship between this plaintiff and this defendant? Ms. Kruger, how does this -- this situation, the qualified immunity situation, differ from a wide variety of other situations in which we might not be able to get to the underlying constitutional ruling? For example, in any case where there's a constitutional ruling but also a harmless error ruling, or in a Sixth Amendment case where there are standards about ineffective assistance of counsel but then a finding that there's no prejudice. In all of those kinds of cases, the underlying substantive ruling might be insulated from our review. How would you say that the qualified immunity situation is different and how would you be able to cabin this rule? But, presumably, in every case-- --Excuse me. Presumably, in every case in which a court does these paired rulings, if you will -- it doesn't just say that the error was harmless, but says that there was an error -- there's a purpose to clarify the law. How is this different, once again? But then we wouldn't have a case. Is that against a different party, Ms. Kubitschek? But, General, I take it that that problem disappears -- tell me if I'm wrong -- if we find there's no jurisdiction. If we Munsingwear this case, the decision is wiped off the case, you return to status quo ante, and you tell all your people that they can do what they would have done beforehand; is that right?

2010,"Janus Capital Group, Inc. v. First Derivative Traders",114,Elena Kagan,"Well, Mr. Perry, who wrote the relevant statements? I understand that they were in the Fund's prospectus, but who wrote them? Who paid those lawyers? So JCM paid the lawyers? And so it was JCM's lawyers who wrote the prospectus, including the relevant statements here, the asserted misrepresentations? Well, suppose the complaint had alleged that. Suppose the complaint had simply said: JCM's lawyers authored the relevant statements in the prospectus. Would that be enough to survive a motion to dismiss? They're paid by JCM. These are in-house counsel for the investment advisor. Mr. Perry, does the Fund have employees? Who are the Fund's employees? Are all of the employees also employees of JCM? And could you just run through a little bit how one of these prospectuses gets -- gets issues eventually? The JCM lawyers start the process by drafting, and then what happens? Well, here, I believe there was a statement in your interrogatories that it's JCM's lawyers, in-house lawyers, who drafted the relevant statement. And then what happens? Was there any change to these statements made by the board of trustees? Yes. Mr. Frederick, a substantial part of the power of your argument comes from this notion that, as Justice Ginsburg said, that JCM was in the driver's seat, that JCM had control, that they were -- Janus was at most an alter ego of JCM and maybe something more, that it was just a creature of JCM. But the securities legislation seems to deal with that in section 20. And your case is not brought under section 20, and because of the relationship between mutual funds and their investment advisors, presumably could not be brought under section 20. So, why should we think relevant the kind of controlled relationship that you're talking about? Mr. Gannon, suppose that we think that the test that the SEC is using and you recite on page 13 is really pretty broad and that it might apply to a range of factual situations that are not before us. Is there a way to confine our holding just to the mutual fund situation, and if there is, how would you do that? Mr. Perry, on the allegations of this complaint, these plaintiffs were harmed by the misrepresentations, the alleged misrepresentations from JCM to the fund. So if the Fund was duped, would these shareholders, JCM's shareholders, have any relief?

2010,"Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S.A.",114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Dunnegan, suppose I disagree with you on that, and suppose I think that actual knowledge of a patent or willful blindness as to whether a patent exists is the right standard. Could a reasonable jury have found that in this case? A reasonable jury couldn't have looked at the facts that Justice Ginsburg suggested -- you know, you do not tell the lawyer that you, in fact, have copied the product and say that's -- a reasonable jury -- that's willful blindness. Mr. Dunnegan, could I take you to the standard? Because in Aro II we said that the appropriate standard in subsection (c) was actual knowledge. Why shouldn't we just say it's the same? Whether it is (b) or (c), these are just two means of -- of doing a contributory infringement, and the knowledge/willful blindness standard, once we've said it applies to (c), it applies to (b) as well? No, (b) and (c) have different standards as to -- not the knowledge of the patent but -- but what the person is -- the acts that constitute infringement. But that's a different thing from whether they should have different standards as to the knowledge of the patent. But, Mr. Dunnegan, in Grokster, there was no question as to whether they knew that the -- that the things were copyrighted. So why is Grokster relevant here? They conceded the very thing that we're arguing over. So would you have any objection to an actual knowledge willful blindness standard? Would that be all right with you? I take it that we would do that on the basis of Aro II? We would just say that's the standard for (c) and that should be the statement for (b)? Well, 271(c) includes the word knowing, you have to know that an item has no noninfringing uses. That is a different kind of knowledge than the knowledge that we are talking about here. And because of the infringement, but not necessarily that there was a patent, not necessarily the legal effect as opposed to the act. Why aren't you both wrong, that Grokster didn't deal with the question that we are dealing with, which was knowledge of a patent or knowledge of a copyright, that Grokster dealt with whether there was specific intent or whether there needed to be specific intent to encourage infringing acts. That is what Grokster was about, an entirely separate question.

2010,Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization v. Winn,114,Elena Kagan,"So if you are right, General Katyal, the Court was without authority to decide Walz, Nyquist, Hunt, Mueller, Hibbs, this -- this very case, just a few years ago? That the Court was out of authority to decide any of those cases, but somehow nobody on the Court recognized that fact, nor did the SG recognize that fact? The SG participated, I believe, in each of those cases. Ms. Bickett, could you explain something to me just -- I have been puzzling and puzzling over this scheme. Can you tell me why Arizona adopted this sort of scheme rather than the more typical tuition voucher scheme? In other words tuition voucher schemes the state just gives the voucher or scholarship or what have you. This is so much more complicated and complex and unusual. And it just left me wondering why it was chosen or what the State thinks the advantages of it are now? Could I try Justice Kennedy's question in a slightly different way. I'm assuming that you would agree that if this was just a straight tuition voucher program, the State could not give tuition vouchers on the basis of religion, could not say, if you are a Catholic you don't get these tuition vouchers. But what the State has done here, apparently, is to set up a scheme that uses intermediaries that can make exactly that distinction, that can say, sorry, if you are a Catholic you don't get scholarships out of our STO. And the question is why should the State be able to do that? If the State can't do it itself in providing tuition vouchers, why should the State be able to set up a system using intermediaries that exist for no other reason than to administer this program that can make those distinctions? But the plaintiffs contend, the plaintiffs contend and this is a motion to dismiss, so we have to accept their contentions as settled, that there are STOs that make these distinctions that clearly would be impermissible if the State administered the program. These are not preexisting charitable organizations. They are not preexisting schools. They are entities that are set up solely for the purpose of administering this program, and yet the State is saying it can make distinctions that the State itself cannot. But you are saying -- you are saying both, is that right, Mr. Bender? You're saying both of those things? Could I ask you: Is there -- do you understand the beneficiaries of this program? Has the State said who the beneficiaries of this program are? Are the beneficiaries of this program the parents, or are the beneficiaries of this program the general taxpayers? So I would assume, then, if the beneficiaries of the program are the parents, then it's the parents who have to be treated equally without regard to religion. General Katyal, Flast could not have meant that it is your particular dollar. There would be no way to know it's your particular dollar and that would be a silly and fictional thing to say as the plurality opinion in Hein makes clear. What Flast said was that taxpayer dollars, not your dollar, but taxpayer dollars, are going to this activity in the same way that it's going to the activity here. Flast talk about a nexus the way Justice Breyer said and here is a taxpayer challenging a provision of the tax code, an active pursuant to the tax and spending power that grants a tax benefit. That's as close a nexus as you are going to get using the language of Flast. ",so if you be right general katyal the court be without authority to decide walz nyquist hunt mueller hibbs this this very case just a few year ago that the court be out of authority to decide any of those case but somehow nobody on the court recognize that fact nor do the sg recognize that fact the sg participate i believe in each of those case ms bickett could you explain something to me just i have be puzzle and puzzle over this scheme can you tell me why arizona adopt this sort of scheme rather than the more typical tuition voucher scheme in other word tuition voucher scheme the state just give the voucher or scholarship or what have you this be so much more complicated and complex and unusual and it just leave me wonder why it be choose or what the state think the advantage of it be now could i try justice kennedy s question in a slightly different way I be assume that you would agree that if this be just a straight tuition voucher program the state could not give tuition voucher on the basis of religion could not say if you be a catholic you do not get these tuition voucher but what the state have do here apparently be to set up a scheme that use intermediary that can make exactly that distinction that can say sorry if you be a catholic you do not get scholarship out of our sto and the question be why should the state be able to do that if the state can not do it itself in provide tuition voucher why should the state be able to set up a system use intermediary that exist for no other reason than to administer this program that can make those distinction but the plaintiff contend the plaintiff contend and this be a motion to dismiss so we have to accept their contention as settle that there be stos that make these distinction that clearly would be impermissible if the state administer the program these be not preexist charitable organization they be not preexist school they be entity that be set up solely for the purpose of administer this program and yet the state be say it can make distinction that the state itself can not but you be say you be say both be that right mr bender you be say both of those thing could i ask you be there do you understand the beneficiary of this program have the state say who the beneficiary of this program be be the beneficiary of this program the parent or be the beneficiary of this program the general taxpayer so i would assume then if the beneficiary of the program be the parent then it be the parent who have to be treat equally without regard to religion general katyal flast could not have mean that it be your particular dollar there would be no way to know it be your particular dollar and that would be a silly and fictional thing to say as the plurality opinion in hein make clear what flast say be that taxpayer dollar not your dollar but taxpayer dollar be go to this activity in the same way that it be go to the activity here flast talk about a nexus the way justice breyer say and here be a taxpayer challenge a provision of the tax code an active pursuant to the tax and spending power that grant a tax benefit that be as close a nexus as you be go to get use the language of flast ,204.26,Roberts Court,"Nov 3, 2010",Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization,"Kathleen M.

And so they go to his house the next day and they see him getting back in the car. Could they arrest him then? So the re-offense -- the re-offense just cuts off the original taint? Because you could say that if he got back in the car right after the stop, if the police for some reason did not impound the car and he got back in the car, that's another offense, and so by your theory, then they could properly arrest him and use all of this knowledge in a prosecution? So, Ms. Halligan, suppose -- you're suggesting there should be an exception for knowledge of identity.

Can the government then use that knowledge of identity, knowledge that this person goes under this alias, in order to build a case around this guy? No, they find out this person's alias as the result of the illegal search, and that allows them to build a substantial criminal case. So there's a diary, and it says: I am John Smith. That's Keyser Soze. [Laughter] I am Keyser Soze. That would not be suppressible? I think that that's not right, Ms. Halligan, because the search is the poisonous tree. Now, it might be that the name can't be suppressed, but it still might be that everything that's discovered as a result of knowing the name, which would never be discovered unless the search had taken place, could be suppressible. Why does it-- --Your government records argument, is it limited to New York City records or does it also apply to FBI records, to records of other cities and states which, presumably, would be available on a reciprocal basis? How about private databases that are going to be available to the government upon request? Mr. Shah, how would you think about this problem?

2010,Davis v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Kerr, let's say I'm concerned about the kinds of issues that you're raise, the incentives on defense counsel and also the oddity of the Court deciding a case in which it's absolutely not possible to grant a remedy. Wouldn't the solution to that be not the rule that you are advocating, but instead a much more limited rule which said that in that case the exclusionary rule applied, but not in any other case, not in any case on direct appeal? I guess, Mr. Kerr, I'm not sure that that's right. Justice Harlan was talking about constitutional rights at a period where, as the Chief Justice said, the exclusionary rule was viewed as part of the constitutional right. But if this Court doesn't view the exclusionary rule that way any more, if it views the exclusionary rule as simply a prophylactic rule which gives a particular defendant a windfall in order to gain systemic effects, systemic benefits, why would we do it any more broadly than we would need to do it? And we would just say: Look, we understand your point that this would very much change the incentives for defense counsel. We understand your point that it's kind of, I don't know, maybe inconsistent with Article III to take a case in which there was absolutely no chance of relief being granted, but we can deal with those issues simply by saying that in your case you get relief, but not in any other. Mr. Dreeben, do you think that if a lawyer did that, if a lawyer filed a cert petition and said you should overturn the following Fourth Amendment precedent, and that was all that was in the cert petition, would we be able to grant that cert petition knowing that there was no possibility of relief for that petitioner? But you think that we would have appropriate Article III authority to decide that question without any hope of relief? ",mr kerr let us say I be concern about the kind of issue that you be raise the incentive on defense counsel and also the oddity of the court decide a case in which it be absolutely not possible to grant a remedy would not the solution to that be not the rule that you be advocate but instead a much more limited rule which say that in that case the exclusionary rule apply but not in any other case not in any case on direct appeal i guess mr kerr I be not sure that that be right justice harlan be talk about constitutional right at a period where as the chief justice say the exclusionary rule be view as part of the constitutional right but if this court do not view the exclusionary rule that way any more if it view the exclusionary rule as simply a prophylactic rule which give a particular defendant a windfall in order to gain systemic effect systemic benefit why would we do it any more broadly than we would need to do it and we would just say look we understand your point that this would very much change the incentive for defense counsel we understand your point that it be kind of i do not know maybe inconsistent with article iii to take a case in which there be absolutely no chance of relief be grant but we can deal with those issue simply by say that in your case you get relief but not in any other mr dreeben do you think that if a lawyer do that if a lawyer file a cert petition and say you should overturn the following fourth amendment precedent and that be all that be in the cert petition would we be able to grant that cert petition know that there be no possibility of relief for that petitioner but you think that we would have appropriate article iii authority to decide that question without any hope of relief ,113.26,Roberts Court,"Mar 21, 2011",Willie Gene Davis,United States,09-11328,"Nov 1, 2010","Jun 16, 2011",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2010,Wall v. Kholi,114,Elena Kagan,"But isn't that true regardless of whether the Rule 35 motion seeks legal relief or discretionary relief alone, that both can be made prior to the finality of the judgment? And -- and if I understand your argument, your argument is that Rule 35 motions that seek legal review do fall within the 2244(d)(2) language. It's just that Rule 35 motions that seek discretionary relief do not. Mr. Weisman, I think that that's not right, that the -- as you say, that the Rule 35 motion that Rhode Island has is based on the Federal Rule 35 motion that existed prior to 1987, and that on a couple of occasions this Court talked about that prior Federal Rule 35 as collateral review. Am I wrong about that? U.S. v. Robinson, Barton v. United States. I might be wrong about it. Mr. Weisman, I'm sorry. Before you talk about policy, so this motion to reduce sentence is very short. It just says that the man ""prays that the sentence imposed with respect to the above matter be reduced in accordance with the provisions of Rule 35. "" Would it make a difference to you if it said he prays that the sentence imposed -- he ""prays that the illegal sentence imposed with respect to the above matter be reduced in accordance with provisions of Rule 35? "" If he had put in that word ""illegal"", would that have made the difference? So but that does suggest the difficulty that Justice Scalia raises, is that we are going to have to look at the particular rule of the State, we are going to have to look at the particular motion, we are going to look at any -- we're going to have to look at any State law regarding how motions are construed. And this is going to be a very difficult determination. But, Mr. Weisman, that's true also of State habeas claims that are based only on State law. But six circuits have said that 2244(d)(2) applies to those claims. Are you contesting that? Where the exhaustion policy does not come into effect. I think, Ms. Mizner, the amicus brief in this case asserted that in Rhode Island or in other States with a rule like this many judges sit on these Rule 35 motions. They just let them stay pending for a considerable period of time, in order to retain some ability to modify the sentence if and when they feel like doing so. Is that your understanding of what happens to these motions, that they just sit, that they are not denied? Do you-- --Do you think that a petition for clemency that is presented to the governor would toll the limitations period? Why -- why is that different? ",but be not that true regardless of whether the rule motion seek legal relief or discretionary relief alone that both can be make prior to the finality of the judgment and and if i understand your argument your argument be that rule motion that seek legal review do fall within the d language it be just that rule motion that seek discretionary relief do not mr weisman i think that that be not right that the as you say that the rule motion that rhode island have be base on the federal rule motion that exist prior to and that on a couple of occasion this court talk about that prior federal rule as collateral review be i wrong about that us v robinson barton v united state i might be wrong about it mr weisman I be sorry before you talk about policy so this motion to reduce sentence be very short it just say that the man prays that the sentence impose with respect to the above matter be reduce in accordance with the provision of rule would it make a difference to you if it say he pray that the sentence impose he prays that the illegal sentence impose with respect to the above matter be reduce in accordance with provision of rule if he have put in that word illegal would that have make the difference so but that do suggest the difficulty that justice scalia raise be that we be go to have to look at the particular rule of the state we be go to have to look at the particular motion we be go to look at any we be go to have to look at any state law regard how motion be construe and this be go to be a very difficult determination but mr weisman that be true also of state habeas claim that be base only on state law but six circuit have say that d applies to those claim be you contest that where the exhaustion policy do not come into effect i think ms mizner the amicus brief in this case assert that in rhode island or in other state with a rule like this many judge sit on these rule motion they just let them stay pending for a considerable period of time in order to retain some ability to modify the sentence if and when they feel like do so be that your understanding of what happen to these motion that they just sit that they be not deny do you do you think that a petition for clemency that be present to the governor would toll the limitation period why why be that different ,163.05,Roberts Court,"Nov 29, 2010","Ashbel T.

If this is just conduct, if this is not proscribable speech of the kind that R.A.V. was talking about, why should we care about the viewpoint based doctrine that's arisen in First Amendment law? And -- and Mr. Rosenkranz, what about officials in the Executive Branch? When the Secretary of Defense gives a speech and the President doesn't like it and the President fires the Secretary of Defense, does the Secretary of Defense have a First Amendment action? So all the official acts in the legislature, in the Executive Branch, you're somehow saying courts are different, so I guess we don't have to worry about that, but official acts across the government are now subject to First Amendment analysis? Well, I don't understand that. I mean, this rule applies to everyone, too. It might apply to one person on one vote and to another person on another vote, but everybody at every vote has to look at these ethical rules and decide whether they have to recuse themselves as a result. Well, do you think that if there were a statute -- let's take out the vagueness aspect of this. If there were a statute that said you can't vote on anything where you have yourself some monetary gain attached to it or if a very close family member or if a close business associate or campaign manager of your campaign, do you think that would be unconstitutional? Because the -- the State -- what the State thinks is that a campaign manager is just like a business partner. But why do they have to know ex ante? There was an advisory process that was set up by the Nevada commission here. Mr. Carrigan chose not to use it. But he could have gone to the commission, said: What do you think about this relationship? Does it fit or does it not fit? I'm not sure I understand that, Mr. Rosenkranz. There are many laws out there that say people who serve in certain government capacities, when they leave those jobs, can't lobby for a certain number of years. How is that any different?

2010,Ortiz v. Jordan,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Mills, if I could just understand your answer to Justice Alito. You concede that the Sixth Circuit opinion is using the record built on the whole trial and that that's a different record from the record that existed at summary judgment; is that correct? So they have that first paragraph where they suggest that they're ruling on a summary judgment motion. Then they go through an entire opinion that talks about the facts and the record. And there are very few citations, but your understanding is that when they talk about the facts in the record they are talking about the post-trial, I mean the record that has been built up as a result of the trial? Mr. Mills, when -- when Unitherm talks about the district court feeling the case and having a feel for the case, it's talking about having ae feel for the evidence and for the facts. The whole rationale of Unitherm is based on the evidence, the facts, not on purely legal questions. So suppose we disagree with you about the reach of Unitherm. Suppose we say Unitherm doesn't have any application to purely legal questions. What would that mean for your case? Which part of your claims were purely legal and which part were instead founded on the facts, in which case you would have a better Unitherm argument? And Mr. Mills, if that were the basic hornbook rule, your claims are all matters of fact or mixed questions of fact and law? There are no purely legal issues? Well, that's what I'm asking. I'm asking is -- is -- are the questions that you have those sorts of questions, or are they factual inquiries that would fall on the other side of Justice Breyer's line? Well, Mr. Mizer, you asked for an appeal of the summary judgment motion, so they might have chosen their words based on your request. Well, Mr. Mizer-- --Is it this case, Mr. Mizer? Take the deliberate indifference claim. The question is whether the conduct amounted to deliberate indifference. Why is that any different from asking whether a particular kind of conduct amounted to negligence, which in a previous case this Court said you had did have to make 50(b), a 50(b) motion in order to preserve. That was in the Johnson v. New York case. Well, Mr. Mizer, suppose that they were. Suppose they committed an error in that respect, and they thought they were reviewing the summary judgment order and not the final judgment. If that's what they thought, would you agree that they had no jurisdiction at that point to take that appeal because the 30 days had run? So your position rests, is dependent, on our finding that the Sixth Circuit was reviewing the final judgment order, which was not what the Sixth Circuit in fact said it was doing. ",mr mill if i could just understand your answer to justice alito you concede that the sixth circuit opinion be use the record build on the whole trial and that that be a different record from the record that exist at summary judgment be that correct so they have that first paragraph where they suggest that they be rule on a summary judgment motion then they go through an entire opinion that talk about the fact and the record and there be very few citation but your understanding be that when they talk about the fact in the record they be talk about the post trial i mean the record that have be build up as a result of the trial mr mill when when unitherm talk about the district court feel the case and have a feel for the case it be talk about have ae feel for the evidence and for the fact the whole rationale of unitherm be base on the evidence the fact not on purely legal question so suppose we disagree with you about the reach of unitherm suppose we say unitherm do not have any application to purely legal question what would that mean for your case which part of your claim we be purely legal and which part we be instead found on the fact in which case you would have a good unitherm argument and mr mill if that we be the basic hornbook rule your claim be all matter of fact or mixed question of fact and law there be no purely legal issue well that be what I be ask I be ask be be be the question that you have those sort of question or be they factual inquiry that would fall on the other side of justice breyer s line well mr mizer you ask for an appeal of the summary judgment motion so they might have choose their word base on your request well mr mizer be it this case mr mizer take the deliberate indifference claim the question be whether the conduct amount to deliberate indifference why be that any different from ask whether a particular kind of conduct amount to negligence which in a previous case this court say you have do have to make b a b motion in order to preserve that be in the johnson v new york case well mr mizer suppose that they we be suppose they commit an error in that respect and they think they we be review the summary judgment order and not the final judgment if that be what they think would you agree that they have no jurisdiction at that point to take that appeal because the day have run so your position rest be dependent on our finding that the sixth circuit be review the final judgment order which be not what the sixth circuit in fact say it be do ,154.28,Roberts Court,"Nov 1, 2010",Michelle Ortiz,Paula Jordan and Rebecca Bright,09-737,"Apr 26, 2010","Jan 24, 2011",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2010,Skinner v. Switzer,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Owen, as I read -- as I read -- I'm sorry. Mr. Owen, could I take you back to Rooker-Feldman with that as the premise? You said that what you are attacking is the judgment. I read your complaint as having an important strand where you were not attacking the judicial judgment, but instead were attacking actions of the prosecutor's office, independent of any judgment of the State courts. Are you abandoning that part of your complaint, or are you continuing to maintain it? Because certainly, if you talk about the judgment alone, it at least gets you into Rooker-Feldman territory, whereas if you talk about the prosecutor, it does not. Mr. Coleman, if you could answer Justice Breyer's question, because there are two phrases, necessarily imply the invalidity of the conviction and necessarily spell speedier release; and either you think that your case fits one of those or both of those standards, or you are asking us to abandon that standard. But how could this be brought in habeas? If Mr. Skinner wants this evidence and -- and we say you file a habeas petition, what would that habeas petition look like? Well, take the case, Mr. Coleman -- I think there was one recently in the Fifth Circuit where a prisoner asked for appellate slip opinions. And the prisoner said I want these slip opinions so I can write a better habeas petition. Did that also have to be bought -- brought as part of a habeas case or can that be brought in 1983? No, he said he didn't have enough access to slip opinions and he needed more slip opinions in order to be able to obtain a quicker release from prison via habeas. No what? Why is that different? Why -- why is that different? Both the -- the -- the prisoner is seeking a tool that he hopes will lead to a quicker release, although it has no certainty at all of doing so. So, Mr. Owen, if I understand you correctly in how this understanding of the claim relates to the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, what you are saying is that the statute as construed was unconstitutional? And that falls outside the bounds of the Rooker-Feldman doctrine? Whereas, if you were saying that the statute, that the application of the statute in this particular case was wrongful, that would not fall outside of the Rooker-Feldman doctrine; is that right? ",mr owen as i read as i read I be sorry mr owen could i take you back to rooker feldman with that as the premise you say that what you be attack be the judgment i read your complaint as have an important strand where you we be not attack the judicial judgment but instead we be attack action of the prosecutor s office independent of any judgment of the state court be you abandon that part of your complaint or be you continue to maintain it because certainly if you talk about the judgment alone it at least get you into rooker feldman territory whereas if you talk about the prosecutor it do not mr coleman if you could answer justice breyer s question because there be two phrase necessarily imply the invalidity of the conviction and necessarily spell speedy release and either you think that your case fit one of those or both of those standard or you be ask us to abandon that standard but how could this be bring in habeas if mr skinner want this evidence and and we say you file a habeas petition what would that habeas petition look like well take the case mr coleman i think there be one recently in the fifth circuit where a prisoner ask for appellate slip opinion and the prisoner say i want these slip opinion so i can write a good habeas petition do that also have to be buy bring as part of a habeas case or can that be bring in no he say he do not have enough access to slip opinion and he need more slip opinion in order to be able to obtain a quicker release from prison via habeas no what why be that different why why be that different both the the the prisoner be seek a tool that he hop will lead to a quicker release although it have no certainty at all of do so so mr owen if i understand you correctly in how this understanding of the claim relate to the rooker feldman doctrine what you be say be that the statute as construed be unconstitutional and that fall outside the bound of the rooker feldman doctrine whereas if you we be say that the statute that the application of the statute in this particular case be wrongful that would not fall outside of the rooker feldman doctrine be that right ,133.31000000000003,Roberts Court,"Oct 13, 2010",Henry W.

2011,Coleman v. Maryland Court of Appeals,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, Mr. Foreman, I -- I guess the question in this case is what this particular statutory provision has to do with gender discrimination and the history of gender discrimination: Whether Congress was aiming to eradicate gender discrimination through this provision, or whether it was trying to do something else entirely. But women don't get sick less often than men, do they? So you're just adding something to both sides of the balance and it doesn't affect the employer's incentive. The employer still -- the hypothetical discriminatory employer would still say, well, women are going to be caregivers more often, so I'm -- I'm going to not hire that person. And that's why (A), (B), and (C) go to the problem, but what does (D) have to do with it? If you assume that both men and women get sick at an approximately equal rate -- maybe you don't assume that -- but if you do, it doesn't seem to factor into the employer's incentives in any way. So you are saying -- let me just make sure I understand. You are saying that the -- that Congress is thinking that an employer actually does think that women take more sick leave because women get pregnant. And just as Congress was thinking about the employer who thought women are going to take more family leave, you think Congress was thinking about the employer who thinks women are also going to take more sick leave because of pregnancy? Do you have any evidence that Congress in fact was thinking about either of these two things? Is there anything in the record that suggests either of those two theories? I would go with Justice Alito here. If I could just stop you there, Mr. Howard, for a second. I took from Mr. Foreman something that I hadn't understood from his briefs -- maybe because I just missed it -- which is that he's making a kind of analogous argument, that, just as in the prior provisions of the act, employers thought of women as caregivers and the response of Congress was to provide a gender-neutral leave benefit that had both -- that both women and men were eligible for. So here, employers think of women as needing more medical leave because of pregnancy, and the response of Congress is to provide gender-neutral sick leave. So what is your response to that argument? And -- and Mr. Howard, I -- I do think that the point about the package is that if you look at (D) alone, you abstract it from everything else, you have a good point, that it seems to be related to economic security, which is not a section 5 issue; that it seems to be related to discrimination against sick people, which would also put us in a different legal universe. But when you look at (D) as passed at the same moment on the basis of the same record as (A), (B), and (C), with the overwhelming purpose of Congress being to protect women from discrimination in the workplace because of unfair stereotypical gender -- views about what women do as workers, then (D) assumes a different kind of aura. And you can talk about a-number of theories for that, but I guess I would just ask for your reaction to that, that (D) is just part of a package which was about telling employers, get rid of your old stereotypes, don't act on your old stereotypes, employ women. ",well mr foreman i i guess the question in this case be what this particular statutory provision have to do with gender discrimination and the history of gender discrimination whether congress be aim to eradicate gender discrimination through this provision or whether it be try to do something else entirely but woman do not get sick less often than men do they so you be just add something to both side of the balance and it do not affect the employer s incentive the employer still the hypothetical discriminatory employer would still say well woman be go to be caregiver more often so I be I be go to not hire that person and that be why a b and c go to the problem but what do d have to do with it if you assume that both men and woman get sick at an approximately equal rate maybe you do not assume that but if you do it do not seem to factor into the employer s incentive in any way so you be say let me just make sure i understand you be say that the that congress be think that an employer actually do think that woman take more sick leave because woman get pregnant and just as congress be think about the employer who think woman be go to take more family leave you think congress be think about the employer who think woman be also go to take more sick leave because of pregnancy do you have any evidence that congress in fact be think about either of these two thing be there anything in the record that suggest either of those two theory i would go with justice alito here if i could just stop you there mr howard for a second i take from mr foreman something that i have not understand from his brief maybe because i just miss it which be that he be make a kind of analogous argument that just as in the prior provision of the act employer think of woman as caregiver and the response of congress be to provide a gender neutral leave benefit that have both that both woman and men we be eligible for so here employer think of woman as need more medical leave because of pregnancy and the response of congress be to provide gender neutral sick leave so what be your response to that argument and and mr howard i i do think that the point about the package be that if you look at d alone you abstract it from everything else you have a good point that it seem to be relate to economic security which be not a section issue that it seem to be relate to discrimination against sick people which would also put us in a different legal universe but when you look at d as pass at the same moment on the basis of the same record as a b and c with the overwhelm purpose of congress be to protect woman from discrimination in the workplace because of unfair stereotypical gender view about what woman do as worker then d assume a different kind of aura and you can talk about a number of theory for that but i guess i would just ask for your reaction to that that d be just part of a package which be about tell employer get rid of your old stereotype do not act on your old stereotype employ woman ,211.08,Roberts Court,"Jan 11, 2012",Daniel Coleman,Court of Appeals of Maryland,10-1016,"Jun 27, 2011","Mar 20, 2012",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2011,United States v. Home Concrete & Supply,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Stewart, don't you have two arguments? One is that the statute changed, but the other is that even the statute remains the -- even if the statute remained the same, Colony itself was a decision that found ambiguity in the statute, so you have the power under Brand X to go back to that statute and reinterpret it, if you will? But if the Court thinks it has to reach that question because it agrees more with Justice Scalia than with you as to whether this statute stays the same, then you have independent Brand X arguments, don't you? But, Mr. Stewart, prior to this latest round of litigation, had the IRS ever said, ever given any indication, that it viewed Colony as not controlling any -- any -- any longer? And as a result of this case, the IRS suggested in any kind of guidance or rulings or anything else that it viewed Colony as an outdated decision? Because, you know, I'm a taxpayer and I'm reading Colony, and I'm thinking the language of the statute is still the same; why wouldn't Colony control? Well, why do you think they added that paragraph? Because it seems clear that there was a circuit split at that time about exactly this question and that this paragraph was a response to that circuit split. So what else could Congress have meant by it? But you agree that that's not why Congress passed that provision? Well, Mr. Garre where do you find evidence of that? Because you cite some cases in your brief that end up not really supporting your position. And as far as I can see there is only one case after Colony that deals with the question of whether Colony continues to govern after the 1954 amendments. And that case, which is Phinney, seems to cut in the opposite direction. So am I missing something? Are there cases that favor you that say that yes, Colony continues to control? Well, whatever the Fifth Circuit said about Phinney, when I read Phinney, it seems to me to cut in the government's direction if not to be entirely on all fours. But I ask are there any other cases that you have that suggests that courts did think that Colony was continuing to be the governing rule? Because what I was thinking, Mr. Garre, and tell me what you think the consequence of this would be, is that if I were a taxpayer and somebody came to me and said is Colony still the rule, I would have said, well, I can't tell you 100 percent. I think you are good 70 to 80 percent, you know. It's the same language, and there's Colony out there, and nothing the IRS hasn't said that Colony doesn't control, but I can't -- so I'm giving you 70 percent. Do you win if that's the state of the world as I see it? Well, in terms of what a taxpayer thinks, whether Colony continues to govern. Well, that was the specific situation, but then the question was how clearly did Congress speak to that specific situation. And in order to get his result, Justice Harlan says first that the statute is -- that the statutory text is ambiguous, goes to a bunch of legislative history, and none of that legislative history actually speaks to the exact question before the Court, only by implication. So if you look at the whole of the Colony opinion, it sure seems as though there's a lot of extrapolation going on and essentially a lot of ambiguity. Well, in the end there has to be a resolution. But the question is, what does it look like before you get to that resolution? And -- and Justice Harlan is doing a lot of tap dancing there, you know, going to this Senate report, going to that House report, going to this colloquy, before he can come up with an answer. Do you -- do you understand the preamble as part of the regulation? Because if I look at the preamble, the preamble seems pretty clear to me. It seems to me that your view that the government did not do this clearly enough must rest on looking at the regulation without the preamble. ",mr stewart do not you have two argument one be that the statute change but the other be that even the statute remain the even if the statute remain the same colony itself be a decision that find ambiguity in the statute so you have the power under brand x to go back to that statute and reinterpret it if you will but if the court think it have to reach that question because it agree more with justice scalia than with you as to whether this statute stay the same then you have independent brand x argument do not you but mr stewart prior to this late round of litigation have the irs ever say ever give any indication that it view colony as not control any any any long and as a result of this case the irs suggest in any kind of guidance or ruling or anything else that it view colony as an outdated decision because you know I be a taxpayer and I be read colony and I be think the language of the statute be still the same why would not colony control well why do you think they add that paragraph because it seem clear that there be a circuit split at that time about exactly this question and that this paragraph be a response to that circuit split so what else could congress have mean by it but you agree that that be not why congress pass that provision well mr garre where do you find evidence of that because you cite some case in your brief that end up not really support your position and as far as i can see there be only one case after colony that deal with the question of whether colony continue to govern after the amendment and that case which be phinney seem to cut in the opposite direction so be i miss something be there case that favor you that say that yes colony continue to control well whatever the fifth circuit say about phinney when i read phinney it seem to me to cut in the government s direction if not to be entirely on all four but i ask be there any other case that you have that suggest that court do think that colony be continue to be the govern rule because what i be think mr garre and tell me what you think the consequence of this would be be that if i we be a taxpayer and somebody come to me and say be colony still the rule i would have say well i can not tell you percent i think you be good to percent you know it be the same language and there be colony out there and nothing the irs have not say that colony do not control but i can not so I be give you percent do you win if that be the state of the world as i see it well in term of what a taxpayer think whether colony continue to govern well that be the specific situation but then the question be how clearly do congress speak to that specific situation and in order to get his result justice harlan say first that the statute be that the statutory text be ambiguous go to a bunch of legislative history and none of that legislative history actually speak to the exact question before the court only by implication so if you look at the whole of the colony opinion it sure seem as though there be a lot of extrapolation go on and essentially a lot of ambiguity well in the end there have to be a resolution but the question be what do it look like before you get to that resolution and and justice harlan be do a lot of tap dance there you know go to this senate report go to that house report go to this colloquy before he can come up with an answer do you do you understand the preamble as part of the regulation because if i look at the preamble the preamble seem pretty clear to me it seem to me that your view that the government do not do this clearly enough must rest on look at the regulation without the preamble ,233.77000000000007,Roberts Court,"Jan 17, 2012",United States,"Home Concrete & Supply, LLC, et al.",11-139,"Sep 27, 2011","Apr 25, 2012",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1

Holder,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, Mr. Bibas, how is it different then from a felon in possession statute, where you look at the past offense-- --and then you say, well, this man, because of that past offense, can't buy a gun in the future? How is it different at all? Well, why isn't the -- the government, Congress, making the exact judgment same judgment here? If the activity to be regulated is entry and Congress is making a judgment that we do not want dangerous people to enter, and we're using the conviction, the prior conviction, as a marker for who was dangerous, and that's exactly what Congress has done in the felon in possession statute. Well, that event is the event that the government cares about, which is the entry into the country. It's not as though the -- you know, the government says -- just picks an event at random and -- and makes it the trigger mechanism. The government has picked the event that it wants to regulate, which is entry. How do you explain St. Cyr if reliance isn't necessary? St. Cyr is all about reliance. Well, do you have any case in which a court has deemed its statute retroactive even though it wasn't triggered until the party took some further action? Is there any case out there either from this Court or from another court where we've said it's retroactive even though it depends upon a future event. What do you think the trigger to be? Because in your brief you kept on talking about the trigger being the trip. And I would have thought that you would have talked more about the activity being the attempt to enter the country. Well, that's what is going to be important to the person, right? It's not inadmissible and all the legal terms. It's: Am I going to be able to make short trips to visit my mother? Yes, you are going to be able to make short trips to visit your mother. And then you wake up the next morning, and Congress has passed a statute, and now you are not able to take short trips to visit your mother. So something very real has happened to the life of this person. You are quite right, Mr. Miller, as a formal matter that that is true, that that's the words of the statute. But how many times has the Department of Homeland Security tried to declare a person inadmissible on the basis of the commission of a crime without putting into evidence either a conviction or a guilty plea? I can't imagine that it's like more than on one, you know, five fingers of your hand. I mean, that's the way people prove crimes in this area, isn't it, by convictions or guilty pleas. Or after trial or convictions by guilty pleas. If, as a fact of the matter, the way the commission of crime is proved in this area is through showing a conviction, does your distinction stand up at all? It -- it can't be right that it's ""any"" future conduct. If -- if there's a trigger mechanism that is entirely random, you know, it's -- you can be deported if you've committed a crime of moral turpitude in the past, but not until you go to the movies on a Saturday. Surely that would not change the analysis. And how do we separate those two? How do we decide that this is not that, and that it's instead something else, that it's a regulation of future conduct? Well, Mr. Miller, the Solicitor General actually represented to us -- in the Judulang argument used that as an example, the Fleuti case, as something that people doing pleas did think about and did rely upon. ",well mr bibas how be it different then from a felon in possession statute where you look at the past offense and then you say well this man because of that past offense can not buy a gun in the future how be it different at all well why be not the the government congress make the exact judgment same judgment here if the activity to be regulate be entry and congress be make a judgment that we do not want dangerous people to enter and we be use the conviction the prior conviction as a marker for who be dangerous and that be exactly what congress have do in the felon in possession statute well that event be the event that the government care about which be the entry into the country it be not as though the you know the government say just pick an event at random and and make it the trigger mechanism the government have pick the event that it want to regulate which be entry how do you explain st cyr if reliance be not necessary st cyr be all about reliance well do you have any case in which a court have deem its statute retroactive even though it be not trigger until the party take some further action be there any case out there either from this court or from another court where we have say it be retroactive even though it depend upon a future event what do you think the trigger to be because in your brief you keep on talk about the trigger be the trip and i would have think that you would have talk more about the activity be the attempt to enter the country well that be what be go to be important to the person right it be not inadmissible and all the legal term it be be i go to be able to make short trip to visit my mother yes you be go to be able to make short trip to visit your mother and then you wake up the next morning and congress have pass a statute and now you be not able to take short trip to visit your mother so something very real have happen to the life of this person you be quite right mr miller as a formal matter that that be true that that be the word of the statute but how many time have the department of homeland security try to declare a person inadmissible on the basis of the commission of a crime without put into evidence either a conviction or a guilty plea i can not imagine that it be like more than on one you know five finger of your hand i mean that be the way people prove crime in this area be not it by conviction or guilty plea or after trial or conviction by guilty plea if as a fact of the matter the way the commission of crime be prove in this area be through show a conviction do your distinction stand up at all it it can not be right that it be any future conduct if if there be a trigger mechanism that be entirely random you know it be you can be deport if you have commit a crime of moral turpitude in the past but not until you go to the movie on a saturday surely that would not change the analysis and how do we separate those two how do we decide that this be not that and that it be instead something else that it be a regulation of future conduct well mr miller the solicitor general actually represent to us in the judulang argument use that as an example the fleuti case as something that people do plea do think about and do rely upon ,193.92,Roberts Court,"Jan 18, 2012",Panagis Vartelas,"Eric H.

2011,Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band v. Patchak,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, on the standing point, I mean, does the -- the distinction that you're setting up between acquisition of land and use of land -- this goes back to Justice Scalia's question -- that strikes me as artificial, that the question of when land is acquired is all tied up with the question of what use is going to be made of it. The government doesn't acquire this land with no object in mind. It thinks about how the land is going to be used. So that, in the end, this really is a land use statute, isn't it. And the statute as well thinks of this as a -- is a statute that's designed to promote economic development, which is dependent on some understanding of how the land is actually going to be used by the tribes. Ms. Millett, it also says: ""Under this section"". And the section describes the complaint. It says: ""The complainant shall set forth with particularity the nature of the right, title, or interest which the plaintiff claims. "" So the type of suit that this section has in mind is a suit in which the plaintiff claims a right, title or interest. And the language that you read, ""under this section"", well, that's what this section is about, a suit in which a plaintiff claims the right, title or interest. Mr. Nelson, putting that question aside of whether this is or isn't a quiet title action, there's another question, which is whether sovereign immunity can come into effect after a suit has been filed. It seems to me a hard question and one that has not been briefed by either party particularly. So I just ask you, is there case -- are there any cases that you can point to that suggest that sovereign immunity cannot come into effect after a suit has been filed? Because what the government says is, you know, circumstances change, conditions change on the ground, sovereign immunity can pop up where it didn't exist before. Is there any precedent that you have to negate that? But, Mr. Nelson-- --Mr. Nelson, could I understand the scope of your argument? Because I had understood -- let's take the timing question aside for a minute. Let's -- let's assume that you had filed this suit after title had transferred. I had understood that your argument was, yes, you should be allowed to do that because, even though this was filed after title had transferred, yours is just not a quiet title action, and it's not a quiet title action because you're not seeking title yourself. Isn't that the question? Isn't that your argument? So your argument really has nothing to do with the question of timing. Your argument would be the same even if title had transferred prior to your filing your lawsuit. Well, as I understood your brief, 49 pages of it were about one thing, and there's one footnote that's about something else. In other words, all of your brief is basically saying: Ours is just not a quiet title action, and so we should be allowed to proceed irrespective of when the government acquires title. And then you have this little additional argument which says: By the way, we started this lawsuit before the government had title anyway. So, I mean, the briefing in this case is all about what you now say is your weakest point. I think-- --I suppose the question, Mr. Nelson, though, is whether you can provide us with a reason why Congress would have wanted what you call quiet title suits -- and I agree that your definition is the traditional definition; when somebody -- when the plaintiff is a -- is himself asserting a right or interest -- why those suits should be barred, but your suit involving a third party should not be barred. What could possibly be the reason to distinguish between those two sets of cases? Now, you might just say, I don't have to give you a reason, this is what the result of the statute says. But if I say, just try to provide me with a reason why Congress would have wanted that distinction, what would you say? Well, but -- but in saying that you have just broadened, or arguably you have. If -- if you think that the quiet title action is really about the narrower set of cases, which is when a person himself claims title, how can you get from that to say that there is an express or an implied refusal of -- of this kind of claim? ",well on the standing point i mean do the the distinction that you be set up between acquisition of land and use of land this go back to justice scalia s question that strike me as artificial that the question of when land be acquire be all tie up with the question of what use be go to be make of it the government do not acquire this land with no object in mind it think about how the land be go to be use so that in the end this really be a land use statute be not it and the statute as well think of this as a be a statute that be design to promote economic development which be dependent on some understanding of how the land be actually go to be use by the tribe ms millett it also say under this section and the section describe the complaint it say the complainant shall set forth with particularity the nature of the right title or interest which the plaintiff claims so the type of suit that this section have in mind be a suit in which the plaintiff claim a right title or interest and the language that you read under this section well that be what this section be about a suit in which a plaintiff claim the right title or interest mr nelson put that question aside of whether this be or be not a quiet title action there be another question which be whether sovereign immunity can come into effect after a suit have be file it seem to me a hard question and one that have not be brief by either party particularly so i just ask you be there case be there any case that you can point to that suggest that sovereign immunity can not come into effect after a suit have be file because what the government say be you know circumstance change condition change on the ground sovereign immunity can pop up where it do not exist before be there any precedent that you have to negate that but mr nelson mr nelson could i understand the scope of your argument because i have understand let us take the timing question aside for a minute let us let us assume that you have file this suit after title have transfer i have understand that your argument be yes you should be allow to do that because even though this be file after title have transfer yours be just not a quiet title action and it be not a quiet title action because you be not seek title yourself be not that the question be not that your argument so your argument really have nothing to do with the question of timing your argument would be the same even if title have transfer prior to your file your lawsuit well as i understand your brief page of it we be about one thing and there be one footnote that be about something else in other word all of your brief be basically say ours be just not a quiet title action and so we should be allow to proceed irrespective of when the government acquire title and then you have this little additional argument which say by the way we start this lawsuit before the government have title anyway so i mean the briefing in this case be all about what you now say be your weak point i think i suppose the question mr nelson though be whether you can provide us with a reason why congress would have want what you call quiet title suit and i agree that your definition be the traditional definition when somebody when the plaintiff be a be himself assert a right or interest why those suit should be bar but your suit involve a third party should not be bar what could possibly be the reason to distinguish between those two set of case now you might just say i do not have to give you a reason this be what the result of the statute say but if i say just try to provide me with a reason why congress would have want that distinction what would you say well but but in say that you have just broaden or arguably you have if if you think that the quiet title action be really about the narrow set of case which be when a person himself claim title how can you get from that to say that there be an express or an implied refusal of of this kind of claim ,262.02000000000004,Roberts Court,"Apr 24, 2012",Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians,David Patchak,11-246,"Dec 12, 2011","Jun 18, 2012",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2011,Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Hoffman, could I-- But, Mr. Kneedler, when you-- --Excuse me. When you say in your brief that we should look at this as a remedial question, as a question of enforcement, do you say that because you're thinking of this as a vicarious liability case? In other words, there's an individual person who clearly has violated a norm of international law, and then the question of whether to hold the corporation liable is an enforcement question; or would you say that it's also an enforcement question when we're talking about direct corporate liability? But I think this-- --But, Mr. Kneedler, in Sosa, and this is the footnote 20, we said that the question of whether you were a state actor or not a state actor might be relevant to the question of whether there was a substantive norm that applied to you. And I guess the question here is why that same analysis doesn't apply to the question of whether there is corporate liability. In other words, is there a substantive norm that applied to corporations? Maybe there is, maybe there isn't, but that that's the question as opposed to what you suggest in your brief, that really we should just think of this as a question of enforcement which is entirely up to Federal common law. And I guess the question is: Why think of it as enforcement rather than as a substantive obligation? No, I'm not saying footnote 20-- --It addressed a different question, but it's an analogous question. If the question of whether non-state actors are part of the substantive obligation question, why, too, isn't the question of whether international law extends to corporations? But, Ms. Sullivan, I think that that's mostly because all of these are written to prohibit certain acts, and they don't talk about the actors. So, if I could, you know, draw an analogy, it's as if somebody came and said, you know, this -- this norm of international law does not apply to Norwegians. And you -- well, there's no case about Norwegians. And it doesn't specifically say ""Norwegians"". But, of course, it applies to Norwegians because it prevents everybody from committing a certain kind of act. Miss Sullivan, take an example that has all the extraterritoriality aspects of this case taken away from it. Let's assume that the French ambassador is assaulted or attacked in some way in the United States, and that that attack is by a corporate agent. Would we say that the corporation there cannot be sued under the Alien Tort Statute? Could you explain to me -- we would have to sue the person individually? What -- so this goes back to-- Justice Breyer's question. Where do you find that in international law? Where -- where does it say, when the French ambassador is sued in the United States by a corporate agent, we can't sue the corporation? You don't -- of course one could bring an ATS suit against the individual. Is that right? Now, all United States law and mostly in other countries' law would hold the corporation liable for the individual's act. Isn't that right? That's a general principle of law. Miss Sullivan that would be true against an individual as well. The ATS is just a unique statute. It's unique against individuals, and it's unique against corporations. That doesn't answer the question that you're here to address which is whether corporations are meaningfully different from individuals. Well, it that's -- if that is true -- let me just take you back to this question of separating out direct corporate liability from vicarious corporate liability. Because it is clear -- one question is, is there a substantive international law obligation? But there is another question which would not be an international law question, which is, a remedial question. Remedies are addressed by common law rather than -- American common law rather than by international law. So why shouldn't we look at the vicarious liability question as essentially a question about the scope of the appropriate remedy once an international law violation has been found? But the question of who can sued is a remedial question. The question of who has an obligation is a substantive question. To give you an example, the tort in violation of the law nations has been committed. It has been committed by the corporate agent. And the question then is, can one hold the corporation responsible for that tort. And that seems to be a question of enforcement, of remedy; not of substantive international law. Ms. Sullivan, could I take you back-- --Well, the TVPA is one limited statute dealing with one particular category of offense, and it was specifically meant to supplement, not to supplant, the ATS. So between those two things, the fact that it's limited to torture, and that there was no design to supplant the ATS, I guess I think that if your best shot is the TVPA, that's a -- that's a weak one. Miss Sullivan, if I asked you-- --You -- you said the international community draws this line. And as far as I can see, the international sources are simply silent as to this question. So if I said to you, Miss Sullivan, I want to go back and read the best thing you have saying that the international law sources draw this line, what do I read? But the Rome Statute is different, because the Rome Statute is about criminal liability. And we know that the Rome Statute was meant to complement many international states' laws which in fact do not hold corporations criminally liable domestically. Yes, but that's for individuals as well as for corporations-- ",mr hoffman could i but mr kneedler when you excuse me when you say in your brief that we should look at this as a remedial question as a question of enforcement do you say that because you be think of this as a vicarious liability case in other word there be an individual person who clearly have violate a norm of international law and then the question of whether to hold the corporation liable be an enforcement question or would you say that it be also an enforcement question when we be talk about direct corporate liability but i think this but mr kneedler in sosa and this be the footnote we say that the question of whether you we be a state actor or not a state actor might be relevant to the question of whether there be a substantive norm that apply to you and i guess the question here be why that same analysis do not apply to the question of whether there be corporate liability in other word be there a substantive

different question but it be an analogous question if the question of whether non state actor be part of the substantive obligation question why too be not the question of whether international law extend to corporation but ms sullivan i think that that be mostly because all of these be write to prohibit certain act and they do not talk about the actor so if i could you know draw an analogy it be as if somebody come and say you know this this norm of international law do not apply to norwegian and you well there be no case about norwegian and it do not specifically say norwegian but of course it apply to norwegian because it prevent everybody from commit a certain kind of act miss sullivan take an example that have all the extraterritoriality aspect of this case take away from it let us assume that the french ambassador be assault or attack in some way in the united state and that that attack be by a corporate agent would we say that the corporation there can not be sue under the alien tort statute could you explain to me we would have to sue the person individually what so this go back to justice breyer s question where do you find that in international law where where do it say when the french ambassador be sue in the united state by a corporate agent we can not sue the corporation you do not of course one could bring an ats suit against the individual be that right now all united state law and mostly in other country law would hold the corporation liable for the individual s act be not that right that be a general principle of law miss sullivan that would be true against an individual as well the at be just a unique statute it be unique against individual and it be unique against corporation that do not answer the question that you be here to address which be whether corporation be meaningfully different from individual well it that be if that be true let me just take you back to this question of separate out direct corporate liability from vicarious corporate liability because it be clear one question be be there a substantive international law obligation but there be another question which would not be an international law question which be a remedial question remedy be address by common law rather than american common law rather than by international law so why should not we look at the vicarious liability question as

And you are essentially asking for the district court in the State of Texas to try to predict what they are going to do and to mimic what they are going to do. And that's why Justice Alito suggests, well, look, if we said that only the district court in D.C. and the Attorney General should do this, let's wait until they do it and go from there. But you are not taking into account the fact that, as Justice Sotomayor said, section 5 itself operates as an injunction. And it's an injunction against the use of an unprecleared plan. But haven't we also said that, with respect to section 2 and constitutional violations, that those allegations would be unripe in the -- prior to the district court or the Attorney General clearing a plan? Well, just because section 5 says that there's no presumption of regularity attached to that plan, and indeed, that it's unlawful to put that plan into effect without the proper approvals. Section 5 says somebody has to clear it before it can go into effect. Nobody said the opposite. The question just is, does somebody have to clear it? Here, it wasn't clear. No, I don't think-- Well, would it be okay if we just said, well, Texas has to make the showing? So do you contest the view that this district court did essentially accept the challenges, did sort of say, well, look, there are these challenges, so we have to make sure that we don't do anything that cuts against them? But you know what I don't understand about your briefs, Mr. Garza. If the States can't -- if, if -- if the plan has not been precleared, you should be saying that the States can't look at the plan. But on the one hand you are saying, well isn't it great because the Court did look at the plan, and on the one hand -- the other hand you are saying the Court can't look at the plan. So which is it? Because there is a real tension. On one page you say isn't it great, the Court looked at the Texas plan. And then you say the Court can't look at the Texas plan. Mr. Garza, what would you think of a system in which the Court could start with the Texas plan and say -- the new Texas plan -- and say anything that is consistent with statutes and the Constitution can go forward, but it's Texas that has to show that consistency. So flipping the burden of proof in the way that Mr. Srinivasan was suggesting? In a way that makes it more consistent with section 5's burden.

2011,Judulang v. Holder,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr.-- --Please finish. You cite some cases. You say there was a dramatic change in the law. The government cites some cases and it says there was no change in the law. What if the truth lies someplace in the middle. What if, in fact, when you look before Blake what you see is some amount of confusion; that the board sometimes was following the Blake rule, but that at other times individual judges or maybe the board itself were doing something different, because the individual circumstances suggested that they should, or just because they weren't so clear on the difference between these two approaches. And then Blake comes along, and what Blake does is neither to change something dramatically nor to just reaffirm what was there, but in some sense to create a little bit of order out of chaos. What would that do to your argument if that's the way one understood Blake? Mr. Fleming, the government says that it has an interest in treating people in deportation proceedings less favorable, if you will, than people in exclusion proceedings. Do you dispute that broad premise that the government could develop a system which treated those two groups differently? The government says that is not the case. The government says that it does not treat those two groups differently. Do you have evidence to the contrary? But, Mr. Gannon, suppose this. Suppose that on the exclusion side, you have this category of crimes of moral turpitude, and suppose in the deportation side -- which I think is right, you have a category called crimes of violence, and you also have a category called crimes of moral turpitude. There is a time limit on that-- --That's right. Suppose that you -- the government could have slotted manslaughter into either of those categories on the deportation side, and I understand that there is a dispute about whether it could have, but let's suppose it could have. So if manslaughter is categorized on the deportation side as a crime of violence, you say it doesn't match with the category on the exclusion side. But if the same crime is categorized in a different way by the government, then it does match on the exclusion side. So what sense does that make, the government's decision about how to categorize a -- a given offense on the deportation side is going to determine whether a person gets relief? But the Petitioner -- the Petitioner just says we look to manslaughter, and we ask whether that qualifies a person for relief on the exclusion side-- --But you are saying no, first, we have to put manslaughter in a category on the deportation side, and then we have to match that to the category on the exclusion side. And what I'm asking you is kind of what sense does that make? Doesn't everything depend on which category you put manslaughter into? You are so far from the statute, Mr. Gannon, you can't even tell what's closer to the statute. I mean, you are miles away from the statute. But this isn't a question about the history, Mr. Gannon. Even if we assume that you are right about the history, this is a question about whether this is an arbitrary system, and where you are devising it from and what lies behind with it. You said, Mr. Gannon, the government no longer treats people differently depending on whether they left the country and returned or haven't left at all. Mr. Fleming points out that you said the opposite in your brief opposing cert. He said that-- ",mr please finish you cite some case you say there be a dramatic change in the law the government cite some case and it say there be no change in the law what if the truth lie someplace in the middle what if in fact when you look before blake what you see be some amount of confusion that the board sometimes be follow the blake rule but that at other time individual judge or maybe the board itself we be do something different because the individual circumstance suggest that they should or just because they be not so clear on the difference between these two approach and then blake come along and what blake do be neither to change something dramatically nor to just reaffirm what be there but in some sense to create a little bit of order out of chaos what would that do to your argument if that be the way one understood blake mr fleming the government say that it have an interest in treat people in deportation proceeding less favorable if you will than people in exclusion proceeding do you dispute that broad premise that the government could develop a system which treat those two group differently the government say that be not the case the government say that it do not treat those two group differently do you have evidence to the contrary but mr gannon suppose this suppose that on the exclusion side you have this category of crime of moral turpitude and suppose in the deportation side which i think be right you have a category call crime of violence and you also have a category call crime of moral turpitude there be a time limit on that that be right suppose that you the government could have slot manslaughter into either of those category on the deportation side and i understand that there be a dispute about whether it could have but let us suppose it could have so if manslaughter be categorize on the deportation side as a crime of violence you say it do not match with the category on the exclusion side but if the same crime be categorize in a different way by the government then it do match on the exclusion side so what sense do that make the government s decision about how to categorize a a give offense on the deportation side be go to determine whether a person get relief but the petitioner the petitioner just say we look to manslaughter and we ask whether that qualify a person for relief on the exclusion side but you be say no first we have to put manslaughter in a category on the deportation side and then we have to match that to the category on the exclusion side and what I be ask you be kind of what sense do that make do not everything depend on which category you put manslaughter into you be so far from the statute mr gannon you can not even tell what be close to the statute i mean you be mile away from the statute but this be not a question about the history mr gannon even if we assume that you be right about the history this be a question about whether this be an arbitrary system and where you be devise it from and what lie behind with it you say mr gannon the government no longer treat people differently depend on whether they leave the country and return or have not leave at all mr fleming point out that you say the opposite in your brief oppose cert he say that ,208.78,Roberts Court,"Oct 12, 2011",Joel Judulang,"Eric H.

2011,Missouri v. Frye,114,Elena Kagan,"So Mr. Koster-- So I think, Mr. Yang, what Justice Sotomayor was suggesting is that your position does in fact require you to say that if there were no counsel at all in the proceedings, that would be perfectly -- that -- you know, there would not be a constitutional problem with that. Once he pleads guilty, it just wipes away the fact that no counsel has been appointed for him. So does that mean, Mr. Yang, a State could set up a system where it says we are going to do all our negotiating with the defendant with no counsel present in the room, but we are going to keep a lawyer on board just in the courtroom to advise him whether he should plead -- to advise him about the plea that he struck, even though he struck this plea with no counsel in the room, and that would be perfectly okay? All the negotiations could be uncounseled. Well, I don't understand how you can say that, if you -- you know -- you are saying that; because you're saying that in the end the guilty plea wipes all constitutional error away. Well, Mr. Yang, there are different kinds of unfairness. One kind of unfairness is when you are badly advised and you, therefore, waived your right to trial and you would have gone. But there is another prejudice, which is you and ten other guys are all in the same situation and those ten other guys come up with a favorable plea deal because their lawyers are paying attention, and you come up with an unfavorable plea deal because your lawyer has fallen asleep. And to the extent that we have an effective assistance right that means something, that unfairness needs to be addressed by it, doesn't it? Well, I guess that is the question. Why isn't that the question? ",so mr koster so i think mr yang what justice sotomayor be suggest be that your position do in fact require you to say that if there we be no counsel at all in the proceeding that would be perfectly that you know there would not be a constitutional problem with that once he plead guilty it just wipe away the fact that no counsel have be appoint for him so do that mean mr yang a state could set up a system where it say we be go to do all our negotiating with the defendant with no counsel present in the room but we be go to keep a lawyer on board just in the courtroom to advise him whether he should plead to advise him about the plea that he strike even though he strike this plea with no counsel in the room and that would be perfectly okay all the negotiation could be uncounseled well i do not understand how you can say that if you you know you be say that because you be say that in the end the guilty plea wipe all constitutional error away well mr yang there be different kind of unfairness one kind of unfairness be when you be badly advise and you therefore waive your right to trial and you would have go but there be another prejudice which be you and ten other guy be all in the same situation and those ten other guy come up with a favorable plea deal because their lawyer be pay attention and you come up with an unfavorable plea deal because your lawyer have fall asleep and to the extent that we have an effective assistance right that mean something that unfairness need to be address by it do not it well i guess that be the question why be not that the question ,89.64999999999998,Roberts Court,"Oct 31, 2011",Missouri,Galin E.

2011,"Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Ltd. v. Novo Nordisk A/S",114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Hurst, would -- would you agree that Congress did not contemplate this situation? As I understand it, it wasn't until 2003 that the FDA allowed companies to write their own use codes, and that's what creates this problem. So would you agree that the Congress that passed this act really couldn't have had this situation in mind? So you are suggesting that-- Well, Mr. Horwich, what does that mean exactly, that you represent? I mean, this might be a case where we would give the agency deference, except the agency's name doesn't appear on the brief. So should we give you any deference? And it's your understanding that you require companies to state the scope of the patent in the use code, or might you think it's perfectly permissible for a company to write its use code in terms of indications? So that -- I'm sorry, go ahead. Was not the regulation issued under this statutory section? Mr. Perry, in your view, patent information is just the patent number and the expiration date, and that's all? Is that just the patent number and the expiration date? Well, why would anybody have created this counterclaim to fix the patent number and the expiration date when that can be done by way of the defense to a patent claim? So your argument, Mr. Perry, is not just that the word ""correct"" does no work. Your argument is that the entire provision no long does any work? But, Mr. Perry, there are also horribles on the other side, of course. I mean, here's -- there's -- there's the statute, and it has three provisions, and two of them are vague and one of them works against you. One is an approved method. I think, you know, you both go back and forth about it; it depends on context. One is patent information, which, you know, maybe you are right, and maybe Mr. Hurst is right. It's not really quite clear what it means to be under subsection (b) or (c). The third is correct. You basically read ""correct"" out of the statute. So at best, this is an unclear statute from your point of view. And then there is the question of what it allows you to do. The statute read your way essentially allows you to unilaterally expand your patent in areas in which it's quite clear that your patent ought not to go -- does not go -- but allows you to do that. So why should we read the statute so that it effects a purpose that is entirely antagonistic to the purpose that Congress had in passing this statute, given that the statute is at best from your perspective ambiguous? But -- but here's what we know about Congress's intent. And it goes back to the Mylan suit. What we know about Congress's intent is that Congress wanted to give a generic manufacturer in this situation a remedy when there was a completely irrelevant patent. And the question is why we should consider this to be any different. In some respects, this makes -- this is worse from the generic manufacturer's point of view because the generic manufacturer doesn't even have a defense in an infringement suit-- --so why should we think that the Congress that really cared about the result in Mylan does not care about this? ",mr hurst would would you agree that congress do not contemplate this situation as i understand it it be not until that the fda allow company to write their own use code and that be what create this problem so would you agree that the congress that pass this act really could not have have this situation in mind so you be suggest that well mr horwich what do that mean exactly that you represent i mean this might be a case where we would give the agency deference except the agency s name do not appear on the brief so should we give you any deference and it be your understand that you require company to state the scope of the patent in the use code or might you think it be perfectly permissible for a company to write its use code in term of indication so that I be sorry go ahead be not the regulation issue under this statutory section mr perry in your view patent information be just the patent number and the expiration date and that be all be that just the patent number and the expiration date well why would anybody have create this counterclaim to fix the patent number and the expiration date when that can be do by way of the defense to a patent claim so your argument mr perry be not just that the word correct do no work your argument be that the entire provision no long do any work but mr perry there be also horribles on the other side of course i mean here s there be there have the statute and it have three provision and two of them be vague and one of them work against you one be an approved method i think you know you both go back and forth about it it depend on context one be patent information which you know maybe you be right and maybe mr hurst be right it be not really quite clear what it mean to be under subsection b or c the third be correct you basically read correct out of the statute so at best this be an unclear statute from your point of view and then there be the question of what it allow you to do the statute read your way essentially allow you to unilaterally expand your patent in area in which it be quite clear that your patent ought not to go do not go but allow you to do that so why should we read the statute so that it effect a purpose that be entirely antagonistic to the purpose that congress have in pass this statute give that the statute be at best from your perspective ambiguous but but here s what we know about congress s intent and it go back to the mylan suit what we know about congress s intent be that congress want to give a generic manufacturer in this situation a remedy when there be a completely irrelevant patent and the question be why we should consider this to be any different in some respect this make this be bad from the generic manufacturer s point of view because the generic manufacturer do not even have a defense in an infringement suit so why should we think that the congress that really care about the result in mylan do not care about this ,190.17,Roberts Court,"Dec 5, 2011","Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Ltd., et al.","Novo Nordisk A/S, et al.",10-844,"Jun 27, 2011","Apr 17, 2012",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

Mr. Stancil, if that's right, and let's take a case which is different from the one that -- that you're saying. Let's take a case where there are many, many, many more open projects, involving much, much more costs than you are saying is true here. And the mayor looks at this and says, you know what, unless I can just draw the line here, I'm not going to be able to change this financing system. Either -- unless I can draw the line here, or unless I can say nobody gets any money. What's a mayor to do? Well, but I -- I guess what I'm asking is, we have this terrible program; everybody hates it; it's not fulfilling its intended purposes; the mayor and everybody else wants to change it. How is the mayor going to change this program now. I'm suggesting-- --that that is financially prohibitive. Well, isn't that what you are saying, Mr. Stancil? Is what you are saying that when cities create tax policy, they can't think about the budget implications of that tax policy? Mr. Stancil, here is what worries me about this case. To me, this is a case about transition rules. All legislation creates classes of citizens and some are -- and puts them all in a group, and says you are going to be treated in the same way as long as this legislation exists. And then a legislature comes along and changes that piece of legislation, and different people are affected differently by it. And to me what you are suggesting is that when that break is made and when that transition occurs, the -- I don't know how you would apply the rule that you were suggesting, which is that everybody in the former class has to be treated the same as a matter of transition policy.

2011,Hall v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"But, Ms. Freeman, wouldn't it be fair to say then that the taxes are incurred by the debtor and payable out of the estate. Why does it say ""incurred by the estate""? But there's every reason to think, Mr. Shah, that what Congress was worried about here was cases in which the bankruptcy plan would not be approved at all because there were very high capital gains taxes that would result from a sale; and that that was the problem that everybody was focused on, was making sure that farmers could take advantage of section 12. So it's a little bit odd -- it's actually more than a little bit odd. It's a lot odd to read the statutes to apply not in that context, but only as to people who have somehow managed to sell their property, you know, 18 months before going into bankruptcy. How does that work, Mr. Shah, because this is the part of your argument that I have to say sort of tripped me up. Because you define 2 years and 4 years after the phrase that you are trying to define. So it must have been a very pressured Congress. But you are saying that as of 1978 there was kind of an idea in people's heads about this separate tax entity or at least in some people's heads, but that idea had never been converted into any statutory language. And you are suggesting that we should take this phrase ""incurred by the estate"" and read it as if they were referring to something real that was in a statute. Can I ask another question-- --while we are on this, because the 1398, 1399 would suggest that we are looking to this separate taxable entity. But if I understand correctly, in the corporate context the IRS actually does not look to that. It looks to just the question of whose filing the tax return. So if that's the case, aren't you, in that very large bankruptcy context, losing your textual anchor entirely? Why would that be a problem? You said that there would be a significant ripple effect and practical difficulties. And I understand your argument about 13 shows that you have to do this and why would 13 be necessary if Petitioner were right, but you started out, I thought-- --by trying to show us that it would be a significant practical problem. So it just does automatically for the government what is now done by -- by some kind of government filing? ",but ms freeman would not it be fair to say then that the tax be incur by the debtor and payable out of the estate why do it say incur by the estate but there be every reason to think mr shah that what congress be worry about here be case in which the bankruptcy plan would not be approve at all because there we be very high capital gain tax that would result from a sale and that that be the problem that everybody be focus on be make sure that farmer could take advantage of section so it be a little bit odd it be actually more than a little bit odd it be a lot odd to read the statute to apply not in that context but only as to people who have somehow manage to sell their property you know month before go into bankruptcy how do that work mr shah because this be the part of your argument that i have to say sort of tripped me up because you define year and year after the phrase that you be try to define so it must have be a very pressured congress but you be say that as of there be kind of an idea in people s head about this separate tax entity or at least in some people s head but that idea have never be convert into any statutory language and you be suggest that we should take this phrase incur by the estate and read it as if they we be refer to something real that be in a statute can i ask another question while we be on this because the would suggest that we be look to this separate taxable entity but if i understand correctly in the corporate context the irs actually do not look to that it look to just the question of whose file the tax return so if that be the case be not you in that very large bankruptcy context lose your textual anchor entirely why would that be a problem you say that there would be a significant ripple effect and practical difficulty and i understand your argument about show that you have to do this and why would be necessary if petitioner we be right but you start out i think by try to show us that it would be a significant practical problem so it just do automatically for the government what be now do by by some kind of government filing ,138.12,Roberts Court,"Nov 29, 2011","Lynwood D.

2011,Rehberg v. Paulk,114,Elena Kagan,"But do you-- --In a case where the prosecutor is the prime mover, can there ever be a complaining witness? Where the prosecutor is making the decisions, can there ever be a complaining witness? Could I make sure I understand what you just said, Mr. Pincus. When you said it can't be the testimony alone, is that right, that there have to be other acts exclusive of the testimony that make somebody a complaining witness? Rely on testimony, but rely on testimony exclusively; do you have he a cases that do that? But, Mr. Jones, do you-- --So, Mr. Jones, could I understand your responses to these questions, because you said to Justice Scalia the fact that there's been testimony at the grand jury does not, if you will, immunize the person from suit based on other acts. Can you go further? In a suit based on other acts, could the grand jury testimony come in as evidence? So all you are saying is that there is absolute immunity for a suit based exclusively on grand jury testimony, and if the suit is based on something else the grand jury testimony can come in. Mr. Jones, I feel as though now we are just arguing about facts. It seems to me that you have accepted a good deal of Mr. Pincus's case. You've said that you can bring an action against somebody based on acts outside of court, that the grand jury testimony can come in as evidence in that action, and all you're saying is that there's -- there's no way to bring this action in this case because your client didn't in fact do anything. Suppose this a jurisdiction that didn't have grand juries, but returned felony indictments by means of the preliminary hearing, would a witness at a preliminary hearing have absolute immunity? There is a judge presiding there. To me, Mr. Pincus, the oddest thing about your case is the notion of being able to sue the investigator when you can't sue the prosecutor for whom he works. So that even if there is -- are some set of people that you -- that you could sue for actions in the grand jury context, the notion that you can sue an employee of a prosecutor when you can't sue the prosecutor seems an odd rule.

So why is this different from that. But to ask Justice Alito's question in a different way, suppose that the police could do this without ever committing the trespass. Suppose that in the future all cars are going to have GPS tracking systems and the police could essentially hack into such a system without committing the trespass.

You think that the answer would be the same had the district court not made an inquiry 2 months earlier; is that correct? So when is a district court required to engage in some kind of inquiry? Well, I -- I was, again assuming as Justice Sotomayor was, that if we're in an interest of justice world, if that's the appropriate standard, when is the district -- when does the district court have to make an inquiry, and what kind of inquiry does he have to make? Well, you're -- I thought that that test was an alternative to the interest of justice standard.

Well, I guess this goes back to Justice Alito's question, but suppose the judge says to himself, even if the response comes in, yes, relations are terrible because the client wants the lawyers to -- to investigate a particular thing and the lawyers don't want to investigate that thing, the judge knows, it doesn't make a difference either way, because he is ready to issue his opinion. And further investigation of this evidence is not going to change his mind as to any material issue. Why should the judge not reject the motion? Does your argument-- --Did -- does your argument depend on a notion that the evidence against the defendant was weak?

You said a specific number. But suppose it uses ranges, but it also attaches treatment decisions to those ranges? So if the idea-- --I guess the question -- the question I'm asking is, in your response to me is the difference the -- the extent of the ranges, or is the difference that there would be clear treatment decisions attached to those ranges? But, General, I read you in part as saying: Don't worry, because if something strikes you as wrong with this patent, we are going to catch it under 102. And I guess I'm not sure why that's true. There was novelty here. There were some doctors who figured out some new things, which was new ranges of effective drug treatment. And so why do you think you are going to catch this as a 102 matter? If there is a problem here, it seems to me not the fact that there was something new. There was something new. It's that -- it's something else. But, Mr. Bress, here's what you have not done. What you haven't done is say at a certain number you should use a certain treatment, at another number you should use another treatment. I guess the first question is why didn't you file a patent like that? Because that clearly would have been patentable. Everybody agrees with that. And I think that the difference that people are noting or some people are noting is that this is not a treatment protocol, it's not a treatment regimen, all you have done is pointed out a set of facts that exist in the world, that exist in the world, and are claiming protection for something that anybody can try to make use of in any way and you are saying you have to pay us.

And similarly would it be covered if it occurred 3.5 miles from the shore? But, Mr. Clement, you are asking us to just ignore six words in this statute, right? You read the statute as any injury occurring on the outer continental shelf, when in fact the statute says ""any injury occurring as a result of operations conducted on the outer continental shelf. "" and you give a variety of arguments in your brief about what those six words are supposed to do. They are supposed to cover latent injuries, they are supposed to make sure that the statute only covers things that happen in the scope of your employment. But your friends come back and say the statute did all those things anyway; these six words would serve no function under your theory. This goes back to Justice Ginsburg's question. She asked you how many accountants are there on the shelf? One can't really imagine that Congress is writing this, this statute, and drafting those six words in order to make sure that an accountant who goes out to the outer continental shelf isn't covered. Mr. Palmore-- --Mr. Palmore, you are asking us to look at the relationship between the employment and the shelf activities, and the statute asks us to look at the relationship between the injury and the shelf activities.

The back-up positions may be better than the primary positions in this case, you know? Suppose, Mr. Frederick, that we find that we can't find your status test in the language of the statute, and then what this statute seems to give us is instead a causal test, and that the cause is whether operations on the outer continental shelf caused the injury in question.

And they both testified. And now an expert comes in, and the expert says: I've looked at both reports and there's a match. Now there would be no problem at all with that; is that right? Okay. So now we only have one of the lab technicians and we take away the other lab technician. And what you are saying is, well, now we have this expert and she's saying she could do a match, but the question is: a match of what? That's the question, right? So why is that a Confrontation Clause issue? Why isn't it just that the prosecutor has failed to prove an element of his case? Well, is that right? I mean, I thought that the judge here said: No, I'm not taking this for the truth of the matter asserted; I'm only taking your statements about the lab tests as an indication, as the basis for your opinion. So I'm listening to your opinion. The problem is in this whole case there has been no factual testimony about what the results were from the swab on the victim. Isn't that right? Or am I missing something? How -- how do we know that, Ms. Alvarez? Is there a statement from the finder of fact, the trial judge here, that he's understanding her testimony to be not for the truth of the matter asserted? What's the best evidence that that's what the Court was thinking? Suppose the State had not presented evidence of the shipments, so that you didn't even have that. Would -- at that point, should the judge have just thrown out the case? But I guess what I'm trying to suggest is that if there's no evidence in the case that the -- that the match is to the victim, where is your case? I suppose the problem is, Mr. Dreeben, that if the State put up Ms. Lambatos and Ms. Lambatos had to say: I did a match -- I was given two reports; there is a match, but I have no idea where this other report came from. You know, it might have been from the victim but it might not have been. I don't have a clue. The State would never have put that prosecution on, because the State would have understood that there was no case there. The State is relying on the fact that people will take what Ms. Lambatos says about what she knows about where the report came from as a fact, as the truth of the matter, that in fact this report did come from the victim. given instructions saying: And so the jury can be You can't consider this except for the truth of the matter asserted.

2011,United States v. Alvarez,114,Elena Kagan,"General, is there-- --General, what about these State statutes -- there are more of them than I thought that there would be -- that say no demonstrable falsehoods by a political candidate in a political race, and prohibit demonstrable falsehoods by political candidates? How would your analysis apply to those? Would they come out the other end as constitutional? Well, suppose it says demonstrable falsehoods about yourself-- --just about your qualifications, about what you've done in your life, your -- you know, whether you have a Medal of Honor, whether you've been in military service, whether you've been to college. So any demonstrable statement that a candidate, political candidate, makes about himself. I guess I don't understand why it would be more chilling in the one case than in the other. They are the same kind of statement. And one knows the same sorts of things about oneself. Well, I assume that that would be in the case of the State statutes because the State feels that it has a specially important interest in maintaining the political sphere free of lies. But, Mr. Libby, you've suggested to us that we should apply strict scrutiny to all of these cases. Now, almost nothing passes strict scrutiny. Why should 1001 pass strict scrutiny? I mean, it seems to me you're proposing a test that would invalidate all of the laws on the books regarding false statements. Mr. Libby, let's suppose that I agree with Gertz that there is no constitutional value in a false statement of fact, and the reason why we protect some false statements of fact is to protect truthful speech. So if, if that's so, is -- how is it that this statute will chill any truthful speech? What truthful speech will this statute chill? So, boy, I mean, that's a big concession, Mr. Libby. Then you're saying, you can only win this case if this Court decides that the Gertz statement was a kind of overstatement, an exaggeration, puffery. How about extramarital affairs? The government has a strong interest in the sanctity of the family, the stability of the family, so we're going to prevent everybody from telling lies about their extramarital affairs.

But you know, in a circumstance like this, doesn't the secured creditor either get the property or get the money from the property and the unsecured creditors are out of the mix regardless? But those are -- those continue forward, so even if the secured creditor got the property, there would be mechanic's liens on the property, isn't that right? Mr. Neff, can I understand how your system would actually work in practice? Suppose you have an auction and there is the top value was $500, and then you have the secured creditor let's say is in the position of the United States and comes in and says: We couldn't credit bid, but we -- excuse me -- we couldn't pay cash, but we think it's $750. And now the court has to decide whether it's $500 or $750 after the auction has gone forward. What happens? Well, now let's say the court says: You know, I think that the government is right; it's really $750. But you've already had a sale. And you've sold it for $500. But doesn't clause (i) depend upon a judicial valuation? In clause (i) the Court has to say: What is the present value of your property, so that it knows what the right income stream is. How about in subsection (iii) where it talks about substitute collateral? That's completely a judicial valuation, isn't it? The Petitioner suggests that the usual rule that the specific governs rather than the general provision doesn't apply in this case because the specific is not a subset of the general.

2011,Reynolds v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"Ms. Cain, why do you think Congress would have written the text in this way? You said it was very complicated and Congress was worried about different problems, the way different registrations overhappened on each other but exactly what was so complicated? Why couldn't Congress just have applied the statute to people in Mr. Reynold's situation itself? I was going to ask the What are the government the same question. What are the complications that Congress was so worried about? Well, why is -- Why is it easier for the Attorney General to do that by regulation than for Congress simply to do it by the statute itself? What did they expect to happen in the regulatory process that would solve these problems for them? Could you tell me this, Ms. Cain. You may have said this, and I may just have missed it. But under the new regulations, a man who's in the position of your client and who cannot initially register under (b), b just doesn't fit his circumstances, does he now have to initially register again, or does his initial registration stick and he just has to update it when he moves? But then as I indicated. Why would Congress have given you the authority to exempt people? It seems to me that the -- the burden is on you in the exact same way it is on Ms. Cain. But does that mean, Ms. Sherry, that -- that the Attorney General could if he wanted to, for whatever reason, could exempt all pre-enactment offenders from SORNA? It would allow that. So when you say it gave the Attorney General the ability to confirm or modify the requirement in section (a), you mean he could if he wanted to exempt all pre-enactment offenders? To confirm-- --But you're suggesting, Ms. Sherry, that (b) and (c) have nothing to do with each other, and in fact, one can read (a), (b), and (c) as all integrally linked and referring only to postenactment offenders, so (a) is the umbrella provision; it says ""a sex offender shall register and keep the registration current. "" (B) says how you shall register initially, and (c) says how you shall keep that registration current. So all three of these refer only to postenactment offenders. And then (d) comes along and says, by the way, the Attorney General can apply all of this to pre-enactment offenders as well, and can specify how to do that.

2011,Astrue v. Capato,114,Elena Kagan,"But isn't there something sort of bizarre about your reading, because Congress in the (e) section sets up very specific definitions about stepchildren and grandchildren and even step-grandchildren in which State intestacy law is not referenced, but you are that saying that as to the largest category, the category in which 90 percent of people are going to get benefits, there Congress sent us all off to State law. Well, suppose I'm not so convinced that (h) is as clear as you think it is because there are two sentences of -- of section (h). I'm just asking you to provide a reason why Congress would have specified everything about what -- how you get benefits for stepchildren and grandchildren and stepchildren, but not for the main category of people at issue. Mr. Miller, could I take you back to 416(e). I take it that you don't contest that for purposes of deciding that this -- which stepchildren get benefits and which grandchildren get benefits, we are just looking to Federal law, that we don't look to State law on those questions; is that correct? You know, I'm looking at some of these, the grandchildren one for example. It says the person who is the grandchild, but only if, blah, blah, blah. It seems to have just sort of an understanding of what a grandchild is. In other words, it's not really defining a grandchild here; it's limiting a class of grandchildren with a preexisting understanding of what a grandchild is. And so I'm wondering, if that's true of grandchildren, why isn't it also true of children? I'm sorry, the child of a child. The child -- what kind of child? Oh, so for grandchildren the agency is also looking to State law? But, Mr. Rothfeld, I guess the question is, when it says a child is a child does it mean a child is a child born in wedlock or a child is just a child. And we know that Congress knew how to distinguish between the two because Congress distinguished between the two in this very act in the dependency provisions. It talks about the legitimate child of such individual. Well, here it didn't add that word. It just said ""the child"". Are there any other statutes that you can point to around this time which support the notion that when people said ""child"" they meant child within a legal marriage? I'm sorry, you can't point to anything because it's so clear? Well, I suppose the question that is argued at the very least is getting us into a situation where we should interpret the statute the government's way because of constitutional avoidance concerns. Mr. Rothfeld, I'm curious why you didn't argue a different theory which is that (e) refers to all biological children whether in marriage or outside of marriage and the (h) is set up for cases in which biological status is contested. I mean, what would you think of that theory? Well, why didn't you argue it? But, Mr. Rothfeld, why can't one just say, well, first sentence, whose child? Look to State law. Second sentence, when State law treats other people as children, you should treat them as other -- as children, too. So the two sentences can cohere fine. For children, look to State law, and also look to State law to see who they treat just like children. Well, why not? Well, that's exactly right, Mr. Rothfeld. But you have two choices. In the second sentence, you do have two groups, and one has to be compared to the other, which is children. The question is, are children described by the first sentence of that, or are children described by the (e) section? So you're just reading the first sentence out of the statute and saying that the second sentence totally subsumes the first sentence and we have to go back to (e). But the first sentence exists. And it says who are children? Children are who they are under State law. Mr. Miller, what do you think is wrong with the alternative theory that -- that I suggested, that (e) is all biological children in a marriage, not in a marriage, doesn't matter; and that (h) is designed to deal with situations in which biological status is contested? But why do you think that? What would you point to in (h) that is inconsistent with the theory that I just gave you? ",but be not there something sort of bizarre about your reading because congress in the e section set up very specific definition about stepchild and grandchild and even step grandchild in which state intestacy law be not reference but you be that say that as to the large category the category in which percent of people be go to get benefit there congress send us all off to state law well suppose I be not so convinced that h be as clear as you think it be because there be two sentence of of section h I be just ask you to provide a reason why congress would have specify everything about what how you get benefit for stepchild and grandchild and stepchild but not for the main category of people at issue mr miller could i take you back to e i take it that you do not contest that for purpose of decide that this which stepchildren get benefit and which grandchildren get benefit we be just look to federal law that we do not look to state law on those question be that correct you know I be look at some of these the grandchild one for example it say the person who be the grandchild but only if blah blah blah it seem to have just sort of an understanding of what a grandchild be in other word it be not really define a grandchild here it be limit a class of grandchild with a preexist understanding of what a grandchild be and so I be wonder if that be true of grandchild why be not it also true of child I be sorry the child of a child the child what kind of child oh so for grandchild the agency be also look to state law but mr rothfeld i guess the question be when it say a child be a child do it mean a child be a child bear in wedlock or a child be just a child and we know that congress know how to distinguish between the two because congress distinguish between the two in this very act in the dependency provision it talk about the legitimate child of such individual well here it do not add that word it just say the child be there any other statute that you can point to around this time which support the notion that when people say child they mean child within a legal marriage I be sorry you can not point to anything because it be so clear well i suppose the question that be argue at the very least be get us into a situation where we should interpret the statute the government s way because of constitutional avoidance concern mr rothfeld I be curious why you do not argue a different theory which be that e refers to all biological child whether in marriage or outside of marriage and the h be set up for case in which biological status be contest i mean what would you think of that theory well why do not you argue it but mr rothfeld why can not one just say well first sentence whose child look to state law second sentence when state law treat other people as child you should treat them as other as child too so the two sentence can cohere fine for child look to state law and also look to state law to see who they treat just like child well why not well that be exactly right mr rothfeld but you have two choice in the second sentence you do have two group and one have to be compare to the other which be child the question be be child describe by the first sentence of that or be child describe by the e section so you be just read the first sentence out of the statute and say that the second sentence totally subsume the first sentence and we have to go back to e but the first sentence exists and it say who be child child be who they be under state law mr miller what do you think be wrong with the alternative theory that that i suggest that e be all biological child in a marriage not in a marriage do not matter and that h be design to deal with situation in which biological status be contest but why do you think that what would you point to in h that be inconsistent with the theory that i just give you ,258.67999999999995,Roberts Court,"Mar 19, 2012","Michael J.

2011,Credit Suisse Securities LLC v. Simmonds,114,Elena Kagan,"But what takes you out of that background rule in this case? You don't have the two-pronged structure, which really did, as Justice Ginsburg said, drive the analysis when we -- when we talked about those provisions. So that's not there. So what takes you out of the default position, which is equitable tolling applies? The-- --Right. But I guess I'm still not understanding why, if you look at this provision, you would think of this as anything other than an ordinary statute of limitations. What is it about this provisions -- or, I don't mean to -- to -- I mean, you can -- you can make structural arguments. But -- but you know, what factors do you think in this provision makes it a statute of repose? Well, I could turn the argument around on you. Congress surely knew how to write a statute of repose, because it did it in this statute, but it didn't do it with respect to these kinds of violations. This statute of limitations, I'm going to call it, reads very differently from the two-pronged positions that we've interpreted in the past. Judge Posner, Mr. Landau, has a theory for why it is that fraud is treated differently from the 16(b) offenses, and it's that it's much more important to prevent strategic behavior involving timing in fraud suits -- the stock price goes up, the stock price goes down -- whereas in these suits damages are fixed. It doesn't really matter where you bring them, so it's not nearly as important to set a clear limit. Well, you have one theory, which deals with culpability; and he has another theory, which deals with strategic behavior. And I don't know how to pick between those two theories, to tell you the truth. The text doesn't suggest which one Congress was thinking about. And that puts me back, and let's look to this provision, and this provision looks like an ordinary vanilla statute of limitations. Mr. Landau, if we were to agree with you on one or both of those two things, wouldn't the normal course be to remand? And what's your best argument for why we should decide it? But is that right, Mr. Wall? I mean, don't we usually look when we are thinking about equitable doctrines as to whether the defendant has clean hands? You know, whether the defendant is culpable or not seems to matter a good deal when we are thinking about considerations of equity. But I think Mr. Landau's point -- it was a strong part of his brief, I think -- was that there was no reason why his clients would have thought that they had a disclosure obligation in the first place. So it wasn't that they were looking at this disclosure application and saying: We don't feel like it. They were saying: We're not covered by it. But I think you are arguing against the most extreme position. Another position is just regardless of whether there's been a filing, if the person knew or should have known, if a reasonable person would have known, even if there were no filing, that's enough. So that would be-- --Mr. -- Mr. Tilden, is there any other context in which we would extend the statute -- or we have extended or any court has extended a statute of limitations without requiring that the plaintiff be reasonably diligent? Can you point to any other example of that? ",but what take you out of that background rule in this case you do not have the two pronged structure which really do as justice ginsburg say drive the analysis when we when we talk about those provision so that be not there so what take you out of the default position which be equitable toll applies the right but i guess I be still not understanding why if you look at this provision you would think of this as anything other than an ordinary statute of limitation what be it about this provision or i do not mean to to i mean you can you can make structural argument but but you know what factor do you think in this provision make it a statute of repose well i could turn the argument around on you congress surely know how to write a statute of repose because it do it in this statute but it do not do it with respect to these kind of violation this statute of limitation I be go to call it read very differently from the two pronged position that we have interpret in the past judge posner mr landau have a theory for why it be that fraud be treat differently from the b offenses and it be that it be much more important to prevent strategic behavior involve timing in fraud suit the stock price go up the stock price go down whereas in these suit damage be fix it do not really matter where you bring them so it be not nearly as important to set a clear limit well you have one theory which deal with culpability and he have another theory which deal with strategic behavior and i do not know how to pick between those two theory to tell you the truth the text do not suggest which one congress be think about and that put me back and let us look to this provision and this provision look like an ordinary vanilla statute of limitation mr landau if we we be to agree with you on one or both of those two thing would not the normal course be to remand and what be your best argument for why we should decide it but be that right mr wall i mean do not we usually look when we be think about equitable doctrine as to whether the defendant have clean hand you know whether the defendant be culpable or not seem to matter a good deal when we be think about consideration of equity but i think mr landau s point it be a strong part of his brief i think be that there be no reason why his client would have think that they have a disclosure obligation in the first place so it be not that they we be look at this disclosure application and say we do not feel like it they we be say we be not cover by it but i think you be argue against the most extreme position another position be just regardless of whether there be be a filing if the person know or should have know if a reasonable person would have know even if there we be no filing that be enough so that would be mr mr tilden be there any other context in which we would extend the statute or we have extend or any court have extend a statute of limitation without require that the plaintiff be reasonably diligent can you point to any other example of that ,175.19999999999996,Roberts Court,"Nov 29, 2011",Credit Suisse Securities LLC et. al.,Vanessa Simmonds,10-1261,"Jun 27, 2011","Mar 26, 2012",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2011,Miller v. Alabama,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Stevenson-- --Mr. Stevenson, do you have statistics about how many of these sentences are imposed in under 18-year-olds in nonmandatory States? So, you think it would be true, going up to age 18, that 80-plus percent are imposed in States that have mandatory systems? Mr. Neiman, I wonder if we can go back to the issue that Justice Breyer left on the table, and this doesn't have much to do with how many States do what, but instead just to say that in the death penalty context, we have insisted on individualized sentencing. And in Graham, of course, we equated juveniles who were sentenced to life without parole to people who -- to adults who were sentenced to death and said that those two should be treated equivalently. And I'm wondering whether that doesn't suggest that the rules we have in the death penalty context about individualized sentencing ought to apply to juveniles who are sentenced to life without parole? Regardless of how many States do what and how many times this happened, but just, you know, two facts. We have insisted on this in the death penalty context, and we have equated the death penalty context to juveniles without life -- parole in Graham. But Harmelin is pre-Graham, and in Graham we equated these two things, adults sentenced to death and juveniles sentenced to life without parole. But the fact that we said that individualized sentencing was not enough in one context does not suggest that individualized sentencing ought not to be the rule in a different context where there is no categorical bar. When you look at those two cases and you look at the individuals, the child's actions in the two cases, they really are remarkably similar. They're sort of -- of a piece. Don't you agree? I mean, how is it that the child's actions in this case were any different from that in Graham? I'm sorry. Justice Ginsburg is, of course, right. Mr. -- I'm sorry; go ahead. One of the arguments that the State makes is that when you look at all these numbers, the number that is most different between this pair of cases and Graham is the denominator. And I am wondering whether you would address that. What kind of denominator we should be using here and how it compares to the denominators that we have used in past cases. ",mr stevenson mr stevenson do you have statistic about how many of these sentence be impose in under year old in nonmandatory state so you think it would be true go up to age that plus percent be impose in state that have mandatory system mr neiman i wonder if we can go back to the issue that justice breyer leave on the table and this do not have much to do with how many state do what but instead just to say that in the death penalty context we have insist on individualized sentencing and in graham of course we equate juvenile who we be sentence to life without parole to people who to adult who we be sentence to death and say that those two should be treat equivalently and I be wonder whether that do not suggest that the rule we have in the death penalty context about individualized sentence ought to apply to juvenile who be sentence to life without parole regardless of how many state do what and how many time this happen but just you know two fact we have insist on this in the death penalty context and we have equate the death penalty context to juvenile without life parole in graham but harmelin be pre graham and in graham we equate these two thing adult sentence to death and juvenile sentence to life without parole but the fact that we say that individualize sentencing be not enough in one context do not suggest that individualized sentence ought not to be the rule in a different context where there be no categorical bar when you look at those two case and you look at the individual the child s action in the two case they really be remarkably similar they be sort of of a piece do not you agree i mean how be it that the child s action in this case we be any different from that in graham I be sorry justice ginsburg be of course right mr I be sorry go ahead one of the argument that the state make be that when you look at all these number the number that be most different between this pair of case and graham be the denominator and i be wonder whether you would address that what kind of denominator we should be use here and how it compare to the denominator that we have use in past case ,136.74,Roberts Court,"Mar 20, 2012",Evan Miller,Alabama,10-9646,"Nov 7, 2011","Jun 25, 2012",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2011,Filarsky v. Delia,114,Elena Kagan,"Ms. Millett, our cases have said that we're supposed to look not only to policy but also to history. Would you disagree with the premise that a person in your client's position historically would have had at most an actual malice -- a malice defense, or a reasonable cause defense? Would a person have anything more than that? But in Wyatt, we said that that was a very different kind of immunity than the Harlow immunity, and we said historically it provided no basis for giving Harlow immunity. So I take it your answer is, yes, it would only have been a malice defense, but that doesn't matter, notwithstanding Wyatt. Is that your answer? Doesn't that suggest really that we don't have a historical test any more, that really all we're looking to is policy considerations? Wasn't Richardson really all about how market forces would make immunity unnecessary? And how is it that market forces play any different role in this case than they do in Richardson? Do you think market forces do operate differently here, or is it basically the same thing? Mr. McGill, back to immunity. What -- one thing I don't understand about our law here. You say there was no historic basis. And I have to concede that that's right. Seems to me that there's -- there was only a malice defense. But isn't that always true when it comes to a -- a private person? In other words, of course there is no historic basis for qualified immunity. This kind of immunity was developed in 1970. It's sort of by definition, there is no historic basis for this sort of immunity. So to say that the historic basis matters is really to say that private people never get Harlow immunity. ",ms millett our case have say that we be suppose to look not only to policy but also to history would you disagree with the premise that a person in your client s position historically would have have at most an actual malice a malice defense or a reasonable because defense would a person have anything more than that but in wyatt we say that that be a very different kind of immunity than the harlow immunity and we say historically it provide no basis for give harlow immunity so i take it your answer be yes it would only have be a malice defense but that do not matter notwithstanding wyatt be that your answer do not that suggest really that we do not have a historical test any more that really all we be look to be policy consideration be not richardson really all about how market force would make immunity unnecessary and how be it that market force play any different role in this case than they do in richardson do you think market force do operate differently here or be it basically the same thing mr mcgill back to immunity what one thing i do not understand about our law here you say there be no historic basis and i have to concede that that be right seem to me that there be there be only a malice defense but be not that always true when it come to a a private person in other word of course there be no historic basis for qualified immunity this kind of immunity be develop in it be sort of by definition there be no historic basis for this sort of immunity so to say that the historic basis matter be really to say that private people never get harlow immunity ,102.06000000000002,Roberts Court,"Jan 17, 2012",Steve A.

2011,Douglas v. Independent Living Center of Southern California,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, Ms. Schwartz, isn't it the exception because in fact you end-run -- end-ran the administrative process, that you put your regulations, your new rate schedules, into effect even before you submitted them to HHS, and continued them in effect while HHS was considering them, and continued them in effect to the extent that you were allowed to do so by injunction, even after HSS disapproved them? Well, Ms. Schwartz, the agency-- --Can I go back to the question that Justice Alito asked you about why there's no cause of action. You are asking us to treat the Supremacy Clause differently that every other constitutional provision. Why should we? The Supremacy Clause is part of the Constitution-- --And the Petitioners here -- excuse me. The plaintiffs here essentially said that the Supremacy Clause as part of the Constitution had been violated and sought, not damages, but only a prospective injunction. And the question is why should the Court do what the Court has done many, many, many times before, tens and tens and tens of times before, and say, yes, that's our prerogative and we'll proceed to the merits. In a -- in a cause of -- in a suit that's brought under a statute directly, a person could be claiming damages. Here that is not the case. A person is only claiming injunctive relief. And that should -- there should be a difference between those two in terms of when the cause of action is available. Mr. Kneedler, why should this even matter so much whether there is a defense available in a regulation that's brought against a person or not. In your brief, you admit that there are numerous cases that don't fit within that category, where the -- but where the State has acted in some sense to change the behavior of the person, to regulate the person, even if that person doesn't have a proceeding in which to mount a defense. And this Court has treated those cases in exactly the same way, haven't they? But Mr. Kneedler-- --Mr. Kneedler, this is what you said in your cert stance brief: You said ""those programs in which the drastic measure of withholding all or a major portion of the Federal funding is the only available remedy. "" and you are talking here about Spending Clause programs, obviously -- ""would be generally less effective than a system that also permits awards of injunctive relief in private actions. "" Can that really be the difference? I mean, do you think if 30(A) were written -- were drafted as a formula, a rate schedule formula, that there would be a cause of action, but because 30(A) is more general in nature, that there is no cause of action? I mean, surely that's a question for the merits of whether there is preemption or not. Is that necessary to your position, Mr. Phillips? Because you could take the view, right, that if Congress speaks to cut off a claim, that's one thing, and a very different thing, than if Congress has not spoken at all. Mr. Phillips-- --Mr. Phillips, can I ask you a little bit more about how this interacts with the agency process? Now suppose that California had done what, the way I read the statute, it was supposed to do, which is to go to the agency and say we want to change our rates? We can't afford these rates any more and we think these lower rates would do just as well. All right. And then the agency and California sit down and discuss the matter. Would this suit have ever come into being? You know, they did not impose them unilaterally. They go to the -- to HHS and they wait for HHS to approve what they want to do. If HHS approves-- --Well, if HHS approved, maybe somebody does sue. And then there is great deference to the agency, isn't that right? And if HHS doesn't approve, then what's there to talk about? There is no suit. So either way, the agency wins; right? Well, it's the -- I was just saying if the agency didn't approve, your clients don't have anything to complain about. Correct. I'm sorry Ms. Schwartz. Are you saying -- this is the way I understood you and tell me if I am right: Are you saying that the test for determining whether there is a 1983 suit is the same as the test for determining whether there is an Ex parte Young action? Because you talked about whether somebody has a right, which is usually the language we use in the 1983 context. ",well ms schwartz be not it the exception because in fact you end run end run the administrative process that you put your regulation your new rate schedule into effect even before you submit them to hhs and continue them in effect while hhs be consider them and continue them in effect to the extent that you we be allow to do so by injunction even after hs disapprove them well ms schwartz the agency can i go back to the question that justice alito ask you about why there be no because of action you be ask us to treat the supremacy clause differently that every other constitutional provision why should we the supremacy clause be part of the constitution and the petitioner here excuse me the plaintiff here essentially say that the supremacy clause as part of the constitution have be violate and seek not damage but only a prospective injunction and the question be why should the court do what the court have do many many many time before ten and ten and ten of time before and say yes that be our prerogative and we will proceed to the merit in a in a because of in a suit that be bring under a statute directly a person could be claim damage here that be not the case a person be only claim injunctive relief and that should there should be a difference between those two in term of when the because of action be available mr kneedler why should this even matter so much whether there be a defense available in a regulation that be bring against a person or not in your brief you admit that there be numerous case that do not fit within that category where the but where the state have act in some sense to change the behavior of the person to regulate the person even if that person do not have a proceeding in which to mount a defense and this court have treat those case in exactly the same way have not they but mr kneedler mr kneedler this be what you say in your cert stance brief you say those program in which the drastic measure of withhold all or a major portion of the federal funding be the only available remedy and you be talk here about spending clause program obviously would be generally less effective than a system that also permit award of injunctive relief in private actions can that really be the difference i mean do you think if a we be write we be draft as a formula a rate schedule formula that there would be a because of action but because a be more general in nature that there be no because of action i mean surely that be a question for the merit of whether there be preemption or not be that necessary to your position mr phillips because you could take the view right that if congress speaks to cut off a claim that be one thing and a very different thing than if congress have not speak at all mr phillips mr phillips can i ask you a little bit more about how this interact with the agency process now suppose that california have do what the way i read the statute it be suppose to do which be to go to the agency and say we want to change our rate we can not afford these rate any more and we think these low rate would do just as well all right and then the agency and california sit down and discuss the matter would this suit have ever come into be you know they do not impose them unilaterally they go to the to hhs and they wait for hhs to approve what they want to do if hhs approves well if hhs approve maybe somebody do sue and then there be great deference to the agency be not that right and if hhs do not approve then what be there to talk about there be no suit so either way the agency win right well it be the i be just say if the agency do not approve your client do not have anything to complain about correct I be sorry ms schwartz be you say this be the way i understood you and tell me if i be right be you say that the test for determine whether there be a suit be the same as the test for determine whether there be an ex parte young action because you talk about whether somebody have a right which be usually the language we use in the context ,239.58,Roberts Court,"Oct 3, 2011","Toby Douglas, Director, California Department of Health Care Services","Independent Living Center of Southern California, Inc., et al.",09-958,"Jan 18, 2011","Feb 22, 2012",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2011,Lafler v. Cooper,114,Elena Kagan,"Could I -- can I stop you on the first? You say mere outcome is not enough, reliability of the proceedings. How does that fit with Kimmelman, where we said it, the right to effective assistance, does attach to suppression hearings, obviously where evidence would not make the proceedings more reliable? Well, I thought that the second part of the test asked about harm. And here the person is sitting in prison for three times as long as he would have been sitting in prison had he had effective assistance of counsel at the plea bargaining stage. So why doesn't that just meet the requirements of Strickland, both deficiency and prejudice? Sounds like a good argument. And outcome -- there is a different outcome here. He is sitting in prison three times as long. That's a different outcome. Well, take the sentencing cases. The sentencing cases, the determination of guilt is over and the question is, is this person sitting in jail for one day longer because his counsel was ineffective? And if he is we would find prejudice there. So why isn't the same thing true here? Well, I guess I don't understand that answer, because that answer seems to suggest that the assistance being provided was not ineffective. But here, as Justice Ginsburg notes, you've conceded that the assistance is ineffective. That assistance has led to a much, much, much longer sentence. As opposed to some of the sentencing cases suggest that 24 hours is enough, this is 10 years or something; and that should be the end of the game, no? I take it, then, Mr. Bursch, you would have the same answer if the State had never provided counsel at all. So long as -- if the plea negotiations were all done between the prosecutor and the individual defendant, and the State refused to provide the individual defendant with counsel, but so long as the person in the end decided, oh, I don't like this plea, I'll go to trial, then it's all fine and dandy under the Sixth Amendment? Mr. Jay, you don't contest that plea bargaining is a critical phase, entitling somebody to a lawyer and to an effective lawyer, do you. Yes, because we have said that many times, isn't that right? What we have to recognize -- is that plea bargaining is a critical phase because about 98 percent of the action of the criminal justice system occurs in plea bargaining. And to deprive somebody of a lawyer at that stage of the process, where 98 percent of the action occurs, is inconsistent with the Sixth Amendment. That's what we've said. Isn't that right? So it's not a critical phase. It's only a critical phase depending on the outcome of what happens at that phase? Has -- have you ever seen a critical phase before in our Sixth Amendment jurisprudence where the right to a lawyer depends upon what happens during that critical phase, where if one outcome results there is no Sixth Amendment right, but if another outcome results there is? And most of the circuits follow your rule, isn't that right? And the flood gates have not opened. Go ahead. And perhaps the lack of unanimity on the remedy question is appropriate. I mean people have been trying to suggest different remedies. But perhaps one way to deal with the remedy question is to recognize that these cases present very different factual circumstances, that there is a lot of variation in them. And to give a substantial amount of discretion to the lower courts to work out what the best remedy is, consistent with that factual variation. ",could i can i stop you on the first you say mere outcome be not enough reliability of the proceeding how do that fit with kimmelman where we say it the right to effective assistance do attach to suppression hearing obviously where evidence would not make the proceeding more reliable well i think that the second part of the test ask about harm and here the person be sit in prison for three time as long as he would have be sit in prison have he have effective assistance of counsel at the plea bargaining stage so why do not that just meet the requirement of strickland both deficiency and prejudice sound like a good argument and outcome there be a different outcome here he be sit in prison three time as long that be a different outcome well take the sentencing case the sentencing case the determination of guilt be over and the question be be this person sit in jail for one day longer because his counsel be ineffective and if he be we would find prejudice there so why be not the same thing true here well i guess i do not understand that answer because that answer seem to suggest that the assistance be provide be not ineffective but here as justice ginsburg note you have concede that the assistance be ineffective that assistance have lead to a much much much long sentence as oppose to some of the sentencing case suggest that hour be enough this be year or something and that should be the end of the game no i take it then mr bursch you would have the same answer if the state have never provide counsel at all so long as if the plea negotiation we be all do between the prosecutor and the individual defendant and the state refuse to provide the individual defendant with counsel but so long as the person in the end decide oh i do not like this plea I will go to trial then it be all fine and dandy under the sixth amendment mr jay you do not contest that plea bargaining be a critical phase entitle somebody to a lawyer and to an effective lawyer do you yes because we have say that many time be not that right what we have to recognize be that plea bargaining be a critical phase because about percent of the action of the criminal justice system occur in plea bargaining and to deprive somebody of a lawyer at that stage of the process where percent of the action occur be inconsistent with the sixth amendment that be what we have say be not that right so it be not a critical phase it be only a critical phase depend on the outcome of what happen at that phase have have you ever see a critical phase before in our sixth amendment jurisprudence where the right to a lawyer depend upon what happen during that critical phase where if one outcome result there be no sixth amendment right but if another outcome result there be and most of the circuit follow your rule be not that right and the flood gate have not open go ahead and perhaps the lack of unanimity on the remedy question be appropriate i mean people have be try to suggest different remedy but perhaps one way to deal with the remedy question be to recognize that these case present very different factual circumstance that there be a lot of variation in them and to give a substantial amount of discretion to the low court to work out what the best remedy be consistent with that factual variation ,191.54,Roberts Court,"Oct 31, 2011","Blaine Lafler, Warden",Anthony Cooper,10-209,"Jan 7, 2011","Mar 21, 2012",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2011,Perry v. New Hampshire,114,Elena Kagan,"But just to repeat Justice Scalia's question, once you're not talking about police suggestiveness, once you're talking about suggestiveness that arises from non-State conduct, why should we be focused on suggestiveness as opposed to any other cause of unreliability? Well, the Court was focusing on police suggestiveness. That's the context of all our cases. Now, you might say, well, look, there is a bigger problem and the bigger problem is the unreliability of identifications generally, but that doesn't relate to suggestiveness per se. Suppose that there was some other category of testimony which proved even more unreliable than the category that you're talking about. Let's say that it turned out study after study after study that jailhouse informants lie. And so the testimony of jailhouse informants is likely to be just completely unreliable, to, you know, double as much as eyewitness testimony. Same rule for that? Okay. Well, now we are talking about, now we are setting up a standard that applies outside eyewitness testimony. It's just testimony that we find to be -- categories of testimony that we find to be extremely unreliable will be subject to this new due process red flag. Is that right? No, I understand you have very good empirical evidence which should lead us all to wonder about the reliability of eyewitness testimony. I'm just suggesting that eyewitness testimony is not the only kind of testimony which people can do studies on and find that it's more unreliable than you would think. Well, it's both; right, General Delaney? I mean, the Court has certainly talked about deterrence, but the Court also has very substantial discussions in all of these opinions about reliability. And from the criminal defendant's point of view, it doesn't really much matter whether the unreliability is caused by police conduct or by something else. So -- so tell me a little bit why you think the police conduct here, you know, that has to be there in every case? It seems that that's not right. I mean, the reason we want to deter this conduct is because the conduct results in misidentifications and unreliable testimony. That's the reason that deterrence is an important goal, is because this conduct leads to unreliable testimony. Well, I'm not sure you answered Justice Alito's questions about why there should be this difference between these two cases. Now you might want to say that where police conduct is involved, the chances of unreliable identification are greater. Or you may want to say something else. But the question is: If we are focused on reliability, why are those two cases any different? So do you mean to say, Miss Saharsky, that there can never be a due process violation from the admission of unreliable evidence? Assuming that the State has not created that evidence, has not produced that evidence, but the State knows that the evidence is unreliable or has a very substantial chance of being so, that that can never be a due process violation? I'll give you an extreme example. The extreme example is where an identification has been produced by torture, but the torture has been through a non-State actor. Same answer? ",but just to repeat justice scalia s question once you be not talk about police suggestiveness once you be talk about suggestiveness that arise from non state conduct why should we be focus on suggestiveness as oppose to any other because of unreliability well the court be focus on police suggestiveness that be the context of all our case now you might say well look there be a big problem and the big problem be the unreliability of identification generally but that do not relate to suggestiveness per se suppose that there be some other category of testimony which prove even more unreliable than the category that you be talk about let us say that it turn out study after study after study that jailhouse informant lie and so the testimony of jailhouse informant be likely to be just completely unreliable to you know double as much as eyewitness testimony same rule for that okay well now we be talk about now we be set up a standard that applies outside eyewitness testimony it be just testimony that we find to be category of testimony that we find to be extremely unreliable will be subject to this new due process red flag be that right no i understand you have very good empirical evidence which should lead us all to wonder about the reliability of eyewitness testimony I be just suggest that eyewitness testimony be not the only kind of testimony which people can do study on and find that it be more unreliable than you would think well it be both right general delaney i mean the court have certainly talk about deterrence but the court also have very substantial discussion in all of these opinion about reliability and from the criminal defendant s point of view it do not really much matter whether the unreliability be cause by police conduct or by something else so so tell me a little bit why you think the police conduct here you know that have to be there in every case it seem that that be not right i mean the reason we want to deter this conduct be because the conduct result in misidentifications and unreliable testimony that be the reason that deterrence be an important goal be because this conduct lead to unreliable testimony well I be not sure you answered justice alito s question about why there should be this difference between these two case now you might want to say that where police conduct be involve the chance of unreliable identification be great or you may want to say something else but the question be if we be focus on reliability why be those two case any different so do you mean to say miss saharsky that there can never be a due process violation from the admission of unreliable evidence assume that the state have not create that evidence have not produce that evidence but the state know that the evidence be unreliable or have a very substantial chance of be so that that can never be a due process violation I will give you an extreme example the extreme example be where an identification have be produce by torture but the torture have be through a non state actor same answer ,188.17,Roberts Court,"Nov 2, 2011",Barion Perry,New Hampshire,10-8974,"May 31, 2011","Jan 11, 2012",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2011,Blueford v. Arkansas,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, at this point-- Where does it say that in the jury charge? Well, as I understand what the Arkansas instructions said, what the instructions in this case said, is that the jury unanimously had to have a reasonable doubt on an offense before it could go down to the next offense. So that's to say that the jury unanimously had to find what is -- what leads to an acquittal. So the jury had to unanimously acquit on the greater offense before it could go down to the next. And the instructions don't say anything about moving back up. And this jury seems to take its responsibility under these instructions extraordinarily seriously. This jury was instructing the judge on the instructions and about how they had to go down step by step and reach unanimity on the one before they could get to the next lowest down, so I guess I'm asking, why do you think under these instructions that the jury felt itself able to go back up? The chief prosecutor kept saying: You all have to agree on this. I think if you look at what the court -- the judge said, what the prosecutor said, what the defense counsel said and then what the jury said, it's clear that they all thought that they had to unanimously agree on something before they could go to the next crime. And, again, there is no suggestion in what anybody said that they could go back up. Even if, general, even if you're not required -- and if you are required -- but even if you're not, here the jury comes back. The jury tells the judge, we've unanimously reached acquittal on these two counts, at that point why doesn't the judge have an obligation -- you know, the judge sends them back for a half hour. There is no reason to think that in that half hour they moved back up the scale. There is every reason to think they just remained stuck where they were. But even assuming that there is some conceivable possibility that they went back up, why doesn't the judge working with the manifest necessity standard have an obligation to say, well, what about it? Did you? Did you reach acquittal? Did you reach a judgment on these two counts? I guess -- General McDaniel, one question about what Arkansas law does is -- it seems a little bit as if it's trying to get the sweet of an acquittal for a State without the bitter. So the sweet is an acquittal-first system where you force a jury to reach agreement on one thing before it goes to the next thing, makes compromised jury verdicts harder, and that's why a State might say we want an acquittal-first system. The bitter that most States take with that is that they say, well, if we're forcing them to agree on these things and they agree on a verdict of not guilty, we're stuck with that. Now, what Arkansas seems to run is a system in which it forces juries to agree on the greater charges before going to the less, but won't take the consequence of that, which is that sometimes they agree that on the greater charges, they're not guilty. General, you mentioned Green and Price before, and those are the cases, of course, where there is a conviction on a lesser charge. We don't know anything about the greater charge. And then the conviction is overturned. What the court says there is, well, we don't know anything, but we're going to make a reasonable assumption, and the reasonable -- no, I think it said a legitimate assumption. The legitimate assumption that they acquitted on the greater charges before they went down to a lesser charge. Now, it seems to me as though there are a hundred reasons why that might not be true. The jury could have just gone to the lesser charge immediately as a compromise position without voting on the greater charge, but the court said, well, make a legitimate assumption. So why isn't the same true here? We're making a legitimate assumption. I think, honestly, on the basis of much more than Green and Price had to work with, if you will, that the jury, in fact, acquitted of those greater offenses. There was a verdict that eventually got overturned. There was no verdict on the greater offenses. ",well at this point where do it say that in the jury charge well as i understand what the arkansas instruction say what the instruction in this case say be that the jury unanimously have to have a reasonable doubt on an offense before it could go down to the next offense so that be to say that the jury unanimously have to find what be what lead to an acquittal so the jury have to unanimously acquit on the great offense before it could go down to the next and the instruction do not say anything about move back up and this jury seem to take its responsibility under these instruction extraordinarily seriously this jury be instruct the judge on the instruction and about how they have to go down step by step and reach unanimity on the one before they could get to the next low down so i guess I be ask why do you think under these instruction that the jury felt itself able to go back up the chief prosecutor keep say you all have to agree on this i think if you look at what the court the judge say what the prosecutor say what the defense counsel say and then what the jury say it be clear that they all think that they have to unanimously agree on something before they could go to the next crime and again there be no suggestion in what anybody say that they could go back up even if general even if you be not require and if you be require but even if you be not here the jury come back the jury tell the judge we have unanimously reach acquittal on these two count at that point why do not the judge have an obligation you know the judge send them back for a half hour there be no reason to think that in that half hour they move back up the scale there be every reason to think they just remain stuck where they we be but even assume that there be some conceivable possibility that they go back up why do not the judge work with the manifest necessity standard have an obligation to say well what about it do you do you reach acquittal do you reach a judgment on these two count i guess general mcdaniel one question about what arkansas law do be it seem a little bit as if it be try to get the sweet of an acquittal for a state without the bitter so the sweet be an acquittal first system where you force a jury to reach agreement on one thing before it go to the next thing make compromised jury verdict hard and that be why a state might say we want an acquittal first system the bitter that most state take with that be that they say well if we be force them to agree on these thing and they agree on a verdict of not guilty we be stick with that now what arkansas seem to run be a system in which it force jury to agree on the great charge before go to the le but will not take the consequence of that which be that sometimes they agree that on the great charge they be not guilty general you mention green and price before and those be the case of course where there be a conviction on a less charge we do not know anything about the great charge and then the conviction be overturn what the court say there be well we do not know anything but we be go to make a reasonable assumption and the reasonable no i think it say a legitimate assumption the legitimate assumption that they acquit on the great charge before they go down to a less charge now it seem to me as though there be a hundred reason why that might not be true the jury could have just go to the less charge immediately as a compromise position without vote on the great charge but the court say well make a legitimate assumption so why be not the same true here we be make a legitimate assumption i think honestly on the basis of much more than green and price have to work with if you will that the jury in fact acquit of those great offense there be a verdict that eventually get overturn there be no verdict on the great offense ,247.56,Roberts Court,"Feb 22, 2012",Alex Blueford,Arkansas,10-1320,"Oct 11, 2011","May 24, 2012",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2011,Mohamad v. Palestinian Authority,114,Elena Kagan,"You know, it's obvious that individual doesn't usually mean what you want it to mean. Now you have a theory that they all just read Judge Edwards and they came in and used ""individual"" but it seems actually that we know where individual came from in this statute. The statute started out by saying person and then there was this moment where one Congressman said, I don't want this to apply to corporations, and the staff member said, I have a great idea to make sure it doesn't apply to corporations, let's change the word person to individual. So that's the way individual got into the statute. And it got in specifically to address this question. And it means what it means. But let's suppose that is true, Mr. Fisher. Let's suppose that aside from Congressman Leach, nobody thought about this question. But we know what the normal meaning of ""individual"" is, and you are suggesting -- let's suppose that they just -- the question of individual versus corporate liability was not on their mind, but they chose a word that means something, and you are suggesting that we should resort to background norms that, you know, what Congress generally does, what it imposes liability, rather than the words in the statute that they passed. And why should we do that? How about non-state actors? Non-state actors. Individuals and organizations. It doesn't really need an answer. Suppose we think there is no answer to that question because Congress didn't think about it other than Congressman Leach who appears to have thought about it and reached the opposite result. Most of them didn't think about it. But there you are. The statute says what it says. Mr. Fisher, one case that you seem to have on your side; you don't have very many but you have this one, is -- is Clinton, which -- which does read ""individual"" in the way that you say, and does it in order to avoid an absurd result -- what the Court thought of as an absurd result. Do you think that this statute is absurd if not read your way? But Miss Ferguson, your story makes it sound as though everybody was really focused on this question, and made a determination to proceed incrementally and not to include foreign nations. Isn't it -- if you -- if you look at what happened here, more likely that other than Congressman Lynch -- Leech -- in fact, nobody was focused on this question. But because of Congressman Leech's intervention, the words changed, and the word was continued throughout the legislative process. And that's the word that was voted on.

I don't know, Mr. Himmelfarb. Why is this any -- any different from than any other case in which we draw the line, and we find that the result of drawing the line is that we have created some close cases, cases that are near the line.

2011,Kurns v. Railroad Friction Products Corp.,114,Elena Kagan,"Could I make sure I understand you? If -- if the Secretary tomorrow decided to issue a regulation saying railroads should no longer use these asbestos-containing brakes because of the hazards in the repair shop, do you think the Secretary could not do that under the statute? But the Secretary cannot do that under LIA? Is that the idea? Okay, then I'm a little bit lost. If the Secretary can issue such a regulation under LIA, L-I-A, then isn't it in the scope of regulation, and then isn't it also in the scope of what's preempted? So on that question, Ms. Harrington, I'm still confused about the scope of your regulatory authority and whether you think you have the capacity to issue rules that are meant to protect repair workers on railway equipment. So can you issue a rule under the LIA that says no asbestos-containing brakes because we are afraid that these brakes injure the guys in the roundhouse. But this does seem a very limiting construction. Napier seems to have a broader construction, and if I read some of your history right you've taken a broader understanding of your regulatory authority in the past. So why this narrow view? Well, Mr. Hacker, could you explain to me, I wasn't sure reading your brief whether you agree or disagree with the government's point that the agency cannot under the LIA issue the kind of rule that I suggested just, you know, saying no asbestos containing brakes because of the danger that those brakes pose to the repairmen. Well, how is that? If they are right as to the scope of their authority and maybe they are not right, but if they are right about the scope of their authority why doesn't it follow that these claims would not be field preempted; might be conflict preempted but would not be field preempted because we are no longer in the field. Mr. Hacker, do you think we would decide Napier the same way if it came to us today?

2011,CompuCredit Corp. v. Greenwood,114,Elena Kagan,"Suppose it said something different, Mr. McConnell. Suppose the disclosure provision didn't exist at all but that instead of the liability provision you had a provision that simply said: any person injured by a violation of this act will have a right of action or will have a right to sue under this statute. And then you had the waiver provision that you have in this statute. Is that enough? Mr. McConnell, the cases that you cite in support of your position rest on a distinction between procedural rights and substantive rights, which you invoke here. But where does that distinction itself come from? Because, it seems very atextual in nature, that distinction, which does appear in the cases. But when Congress talks about rights, why should we think of rights as limited to substantive rights rather than also procedural rights? Except if Congress indicates otherwise and-- --And I guess the problem here is that there is this language in this disclosure provision which is meant, you know, truly to inform consumers about -- about their rights and about where they are going to end up resolving their disputes, and it says you have a right to sue, and you are asking us essentially to read that language as: You have a right to bring a claim in court, but it's probably going to end up in arbitration because of the nature of your form contract. And that seems a very different kind of statement to consumers. Well, Mr. Nelson, but your friend Mr. McConnell says quite rightly that the rules in this area have been fairly clear, that Congress knew it had to make especially clear that it wanted to void arbitration agreements. So if that's the case, why didn't Congress do what it has the done in a thousand other statutes -- or maybe that's an overstatement, but a number of other statutes -- which is to say so? Do you know, Mr. Nelson, whether this statute is unique in this sense: Do you know of any other statute that arguably voids arbitration agreements without saying that they are voiding -- that it's voiding an arbitration agreement? Mr. Nelson, you just said if the liability section said you have a right to sue that's okay, but if it says you have a cause of action that's not okay. But the right to sue is really just a colloquial way of expressing the first, so why should we draw the line between those two things?

Ryan,114,Elena Kagan,"So Mr. Bartels, before you do that, I mean, I understood you to be saying that you would draw a line after the first post-conviction proceeding; is that correct? And the briefs go back and forth as to whether that line -- you know, what lies behind that line. But you would draw the line there? I was wondering what you would say -- some of these statistics is just that these claims succeed very, very rarely. So by the analysis that you just used, this kind of balancing analysis, why we should even go so far as you would have us go? Mr. Cattani, can I ask about your interests here, because your State is one that does appoint counsel. So you already have the costs there. I'm just wondering, in your brief, you talk a lot about the excessive costs that this would impose on you. And I'm just wondering where those costs come from if you appoint counsel already. And I know some other States are in a different situation, but as to you, where do the costs come from? Well, if we just said there is, you know, we can only draw a line in this context and we're going to draw the line here, and this is where it sticks. What are the additional costs to you? Mr. Cattani, if you handled this through the regular appeals process, the person would receive the benefit of counsel. Is that correct? Rather than shuttle this over to the post-conviction review process? Yes, exactly right. Try-- --Well, Massaro indeed said there are good reasons for withdrawing this issue and putting it in a different kind of process. So suppose the State does this, and some States do it: they say on -- in the direct appeal process, we are going to remand this issue back to the trial court because the trial court is going to be fast and can make an evaluation. That's part of the direct appeal process, this -- this remand. Would the person then be entitled to effective assistance of counsel? Even though now it's part of the regular appeals process. It's just the way -- because of the issues that we recognized in Massaro, the State has decided to structure things in this way? So now you are creating a different rule. You are saying anything which somebody determines is appropriately raised as a collateral attack, even if there's been no first review of that question, there is no entitlement to counsel? Well, I don't think as Justice Kennedy says that we ever really considered that question in Finley and Giarratano, because we were assuming there that all the things had been through the appeals process. Well, the reason I think it's relevant is that if you were to say that there needed to be effective assistance of counsel there, then I would have asked you, what is the difference between this case and that case? So that's the reason it is relevant to this case, because the difference is really just one of just labels. But they didn't -- only the first-- --Look at the effective assistance claims. So what you say, Mr. Wall, if the Stated did the following -- if it said we are going to take out all Fourth Amendment exclusion claims and we are going to put that in the post-conviction review system, and you know what, there, you are not entitled to an effective lawyer. Would that be all right? I'm sure the State would not say it was acting arbitrarily in my example. The State would say there is a good reason for it, the Fourth Amendment exclusion claims are disfavored, they have nothing to do with innocence; they involve a kind of fact-intensive inquiry that is better done in a different proceeding. So I think that the State would have many good reasons, but, you know, it's also true that there, you don't get a lawyer. ",so mr bartels before you do that i mean i understand you to be say that you would draw a line after the first post conviction proceeding be that correct and the brief go back and forth as to whether that line you know what lie behind that line but you would draw the line there i be wonder what you would say some of these statistic be just that these claim succeed very very rarely so by the analysis that you just use this kind of balance analysis why we should even go so far as you would have us go mr cattani can i ask about your interest here because your state be one that do appoint counsel so you already have the cost there I be just wondering in your brief you talk a lot about the excessive cost that this would impose on you and I be just wonder where those cost come from if you appoint counsel already and i know some other state be in a different situation but as to you where do the cost come from well if we just say there be you know we can only draw a line in this context and we be go to draw the line here and this be where it stick what be the additional cost to you mr cattani if you handle this through the regular appeal process the person would receive the benefit of counsel be that correct rather than shuttle this over to the post conviction review process yes exactly right try well massaro indeed say there be good reason for withdraw this issue and put it in a different kind of process so suppose the state do this and some state do it they say on in the direct appeal process we be go to remand this issue back to the trial court because the trial court be go to be fast and can make an evaluation that be part of the direct appeal process this this remand would the person then be entitle to effective assistance of counsel even though now it be part of the regular appeal process it be just the way because of the issue that we recognize in massaro the state have decide to structure thing in this way so now you be create a different rule you be say anything which somebody determine be appropriately raise as a collateral attack even if there be be no first review of that question there be no entitlement to counsel well i do not think as justice kennedy say that we ever really consider that question in finley and giarratano because we we be assume there that all the thing have be through the appeal process well the reason i think it be relevant be that if you we be to say that there need to be effective assistance of counsel there then i would have ask you what be the difference between this case and that case so that be the reason it be relevant to this case because the difference be really just one of just label but they do not only the first look at the effective assistance claim so what you say mr wall if the state do the following if it say we be go to take out all fourth amendment exclusion claim and we be go to put that in the post conviction review system and you know what there you be not entitle to an effective lawyer would that be all right I be sure the state would not say it be act arbitrarily in my example the state would say there be a good reason for it the fourth amendment exclusion claim be disfavor they have nothing to do with innocence they involve a kind of fact intensive inquiry that be good do in a different proceeding so i think that the state would have many good reason but you know it be also true that there you do not get a lawyer ,208.64,Roberts Court,"Oct 4, 2011",Luis Mariano Martinez,"Charles L.

2011,Knox v. Service Employees International Union,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Young, could I ask you to speak to the mootness question first? As -- as I understand your brief, you're -- you're essentially saying that it's impossible to moot a claim for nominal damages. Is -- is that a correct reading of your position? So that's a different point, right, which is that the notice was inadequate-- --And when you say ""inadequate"", I read you to be saying sort of not apologetic enough. And -- in other words, not saying, look, you had a claim against us, we think you're right; it was a valid claim; here is your judgment in satisfaction of that claim; that it didn't forthrightly say that. But do you think if it had forthrightly said that, we would be living in a different Article III universe? And how is that? How did they fail to comply, other than the question of whether they were forthright enough about the fact that they were satisfying the claim? But isn't that important, Mr. Young, because usually where we've talked about capable repetition, or where we've talked about the same thing could happen again, it's where an injunction has been before us rather than a suit for damages as to a past act. Mr. Collins, as I understand Mr. Young's argument, there is a serious dispute about the adequacy of this notice, and it might be a dispute about whether it was clear enough, about that it was satisfying claims, or it might be a dispute about whether it allowed refunds easily enough, but that Mr. Young is contesting whether the notice complied with the district court's order. Now, as long as that's true, don't we have a live case before us? Somebody has to answer that question about whether your notice complied with the order, and if it's the case that a court has to answer that question, doesn't that depend on the questions presented here, the substantive questions?

2011,Minneci v. Pollard,114,Elena Kagan,"Suppose, Mr. Franklin, that there weren't. I mean, I think you have a good case about California law here. But suppose we were in a State where the law was very different from what California's law appears to be, where there was no special duty recognized for jailors, and indeed where the basic negligence tort was unavailable to inmates because there was a finding of -- a holding of the State supreme court that there was no duty on the part of jailors to inmates. What would happen then? But is your answer-- --Mr. Franklin, do you have a theory about why these are brought as Bivens claims? It seems mysterious to me. If you bring it as a negligence claim, you get a lower standard of liability, negligence versus deliberate indifference. You get vicarious liability. So I have been trying to puzzle out, why aren't these brought as negligence claims rather than as Bivens claims? To go back to what I asked before when I hypothesized a State that didn't have adequate remedies, and you said -- well, just to pin down what you said, if there were no adequate remedies there would be a Bivens action available? How is a prisoner supposed to satisfy that requirement? But I think the question, Mr. Franklin, is really just a practical one-- --which is how a pro se person sitting in prison is supposed to have access to a doctor who will provide this certificate. And, I mean, maybe there would be means, but I'm asking whether there would be. What is the theory behind that, Mr. Shah? I mean there is an obvious theory when Congress has provided an alternative remedial system, which is a separation of powers theory. But what's the theory about looking to State law for these kinds of alternative remedies? Can I ask you the same question that I asked Mr. Franklin? Because it just doesn't make any sense to me. The gravamen of this claim is a medical malpractice claim. Why aren't your State law remedies better? You have vicarious liability and all you have to prove is negligence. Why wasn't this brought as a State law claim? Well that was just false consciousness that we can correct, right? I mean, if the -- if the true appropriate remedy, and the better remedy from your client's point of view, is a State law action, we should just say bring a State law. Could you give me your best example of a State tort rule that would prevent a prisoner from bringing an Eighth Amendment claim? Your best example of a tort rule from any State that would preclude a -- a valid Eighth Amendment claim.

2011,Roberts v. Sea-Land Services,114,Elena Kagan,"But I thought Congress wanted the system to operate so that people just did it voluntarily without an award. All right-- --I think the way the argument has gone so far is that we've all been saying this can't make sense, and you have been saying, as you have every right to say, yes, but this is what the statute says based on the ""newly awarded"" language. But that does assume that ""newly awarded"" can't mean an entitlement. And then you run up against some other statutory provisions where an award does seem to mean, not a formal compensation order, but instead an entitlement to funds. So 908(d)(1), it seems as though the word 910(h)(1), it seems as though the word 933(b), which says ""award in a compensation order"", suggests that awards can be made in a formal order or awards can be made differently because of an entitlement that is automatically paid. So I guess there are three places that it seems to me your reading of the word, your limited reading of the phrase ""newly awarded"", runs into problems in those three ways, and I'm left then thinking we should do what makes sense. 933(b), 908(c)(1) and 910(h)(1). And in what percentage of the cases are we in that world? Mr. Keisler, if I could just go back to this language.

But now you add to that statute a history and a tradition and a practice in immigration law of imputation of various kinds. One is imputation of domicile in the way we talked about, but there are other imputations that occur throughout the field of immigration law. Some cut for the alien, some cut against the alien. In the world of that practice and tradition, are you at least in a sphere in which there is ambiguity, in which the agency essentially has discretion to decide whether it wants to impute in this way? But none of them are textually commanded, is that right? I mean, they are all situations in which the agency has decided that there are good reasons to impute various factors. So you think that all the imputations that exist in immigration law are all a matter of imputing intent? Mr. Kinnaird, I take it that the point you are making is the statute is ambiguous in the sense that its silence does not prevent the BIA from making this imputation if it wants to. But the BIA clearly doesn't want to. So where does that leave you? Well, are you saying that the BIA needs to write an opinion that says, now we are doing Chevron step two analysis?

2011,Kawashima v. Holder,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Gannon, do you think that you can commit tax evasion without committing either fraud or deceit, and are there cases that show that? I mean, I suppose what confuses me is when somebody is convicted of 7201, they can't -- they are estopped from contesting a civil fraud suit, isn't that right? And it also counts as a crime of moral turpitude, which involves fraud. And all of those things suggest, and I think kind of the cases as a whole suggest, that tax evasion involves fraud. Counsel, what if you do-- --But Scharton was a very old case which had been distinguished away by many courts. This really has no power in the -- in the -- I mean, tell me if I am wrong, but-- --I mean, the paradoxical thing about your argument is that one, it makes us think that Congress was just being hypervigilant about this problem of making sure that tax evasion offenses were covered, even though tax evasion offenses almost always do involve fraud or deceit, but Congress was thinking about these hypothetical possibilities that maybe there was going to be some conviction out there that would not involve fraud or deceit, and so Congress is being super-careful about this. And yet at the same time that Congress is being utterly careless, utterly clueless about the basic rule of statutory construction which is that one does not write superfluous language. So our rule of statutory construction when it comes to this aggravated felony statute is that superfluity doesn't matter? Could I make sure, Mr. Gannon, that I understand your argument about superfluidity? Because when I asked whether (M), the second provision was superfluous, you pointed me to the evasion of payment cases. And you cite two of them. But then you say even those cases will almost invariably involve some affirmative acts of fraud. So are there, in fact, any cases, evasion of payment or otherwise, which do not involve some affirmative acts of fraud? A factual matter argument. And that's what I'm asking. As a factual matter, can you point me to any cases that do not involve affirmative acts of fraud? I know, but we have a very And active IRS which prosecutes lots of tax cases, and you are saying that it just never prosecutes tax cases under this section that don't involve affirmative acts of fraud. And that makes me wonder why Congress was so worried about this problem that it ignored normal rules of statutory interpretation. But It would have been perfectly easy for Congress to write a provision which said just in case that -- you know, just in case this decision called Scharton has any effect, we mean tax evasion, too, without writing it in this way that appears to exclude all other tax offenses. Well, that's just arguing against our application of the normal rule of avoiding superfluidity where we can.

2011,Vasquez v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"What would you point out in the majority opinion below that suggests that they did an analysis that didn't look at the error and its possible prejudicial effect? Well, Mr. Brindley, I think one difficulty -- and this is really repeating Justice Alito's question, but it seems that you are parsing things pretty closely. If I ask the question whether an error altered the verdict, it seems to me I am asking pretty much the same question as whether without that verdict the -- whether without that error, the verdict would be the same. That seems like just two ways of saying the same thing. Now, if what you're saying is put aside that formulation, there are lots of courts that are doing something wrong, which is that they are not looking at the error and its possible prejudicial effect at all, then I understand the argument; but then I ask the question, well, is that what this court did? Mr. Yang, that does raise the question that I think most separates you and Mr. Brindley, and it's the question that Justice Alito suggested. So let me give you a hypothetical. Let's say that this jury was not out for eight hours, but was out for eight days. And on the seventh day a note came from the jury, and the note said: We really think that these tape recordings are extremely important, but we're -- we're having a dispute about how important they are, and we would like to listen to them again. And they do that, and then they come back with this compromise verdict. Now, what you're suggesting is that we cannot look at any of that. Essentially, the best proof that's available to us about whether the error in fact affected this jury's decision, you would have a court close its eyes to. And I guess -- why would that be? So let me make sure I understand what you are saying to me. You are saying to me: No, we didn't mean to say that that was irrelevant; we just mean to say that an appellate court should be cautious about it and look at that kind of evidence in the -- in light of everything else that happened at the trial. Well, you just told me it wasn't, Mr. Yang. Because -- because I think that the reason why this jury versus a reasonable jury is important is whether you are going to take into account what you know about what this jury did: How long it stayed out, what notes it wrote to the court, what eventual verdict it reached. And you just suggested to me that that was fair game to consider in this analysis, although one should be cautious about doing it. Well, a rational jury is not the jury that I said stayed out for 8 days and sent back a note on the seventh day. That's this jury. That's starting to look, Mr. Yang, very much like a directed verdict for the government on the part of the judge. Because you are so abstracting it from this case and this jury and what this jury's reactions to everything that happened was that, you know, why not just go to the directed verdict? You do have a jury -- Excuse me. You do have a jury verdict, but you are giving us a formulation of the test that essentially pretends that the jury is not there, and that we know nothing about how it reacted to various things. But critical to the Court's view in that case was that the -- the defendant could not have contested that element. And you would need-- --Can I ask you a different question, Mr. Yang, which is, you know, this difference in the formulation of the test -- which I find it hard to wrap my mind around, but and -- it strikes me that there's two different ways of saying the same thing. But I'm told that there's a fair bit of scholarship out there which suggests that courts that use one formulation tend to come out one way, and courts that use the other formulation tend to come out the other way. And I'm just wondering what your view of that is, that somehow, one formulation seems to put the emphasis on the entire case. Whereas the other formulation seems to put the emphasis on only the government's evidence, and that that makes a difference in the end. ",what would you point out in the majority opinion below that suggest that they do an analysis that do not look at the error and its possible prejudicial effect well mr brindley i think one difficulty and this be really repeating justice alito s question but it seem that you be parse thing pretty closely if i ask the question whether an error alter the verdict it seem to me i be ask pretty much the same question as whether without that verdict the whether without that error the verdict would be the same that seem like just two way of say the same thing now if what you be say be put aside that formulation there be lot of court that be do something wrong which be that they be not look at the error and its possible prejudicial effect at all then i understand the argument but then i ask the question well be that what this court do mr yang that do raise the question that i think most separate you and mr brindley and it be the question that justice alito suggest so let me give you a hypothetical let us say that this jury be not out for eight hour but be out for eight day and on the seventh day a note come from the jury and the note say we really think that these tape recording be extremely important but we be we be have a dispute about how important they be and we would like to listen to them again and they do that and then they come back with this compromise verdict now what you be suggest be that we can not look at any of that essentially the best proof that be available to us about whether the error in fact affect this jury s decision you would have a court close its eye to and i guess why would that be so let me make sure i understand what you be say to me you be say to me no we do not mean to say that that be irrelevant we just mean to say that an appellate court should be cautious about it and look at that kind of evidence in the in light of everything else that happen at the trial well you just tell me it be not mr yang because because i think that the reason why this jury versus a reasonable jury be important be whether you be go to take into account what you know about what this jury do how long it stay out what note it write to the court what eventual verdict it reach and you just suggest to me that that be fair game to consider in this analysis although one should be cautious about do it well a rational jury be not the jury that i say stay out for day and send back a note on the seventh day that be this jury that be start to look mr yang very much like a directed verdict for the government on the part of the judge because you be so abstract it from this case and this jury and what this jury s reaction to everything that happen be that you know why not just go to the direct verdict you do have a jury excuse me you do have a jury verdict but you be give us a formulation of the test that essentially pretend that the jury be not there and that we know nothing about how it react to various thing but critical to the court s view in that case be that the the defendant could not have contest that element and you would need can i ask you a different question mr yang which be you know this difference in the formulation of the test which i find it hard to wrap my mind around but and it strike me that there be two different way of say the same thing but I be told that there be a fair bit of scholarship out there which suggest that court that use one formulation tend to come out one way and court that use the other formulation tend to come out the other way and I be just wonder what your view of that be that somehow one formulation seem to put the emphasis on the entire case whereas the other formulation seem to put the emphasis on only the government s evidence and that that make a difference in the end ,243.04000000000005,Roberts Court,"Mar 21, 2012",Alexander Vasquez,United States,11-199,"Nov 28, 2011","Apr 2, 2012",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2011,Kappos v. Hyatt,114,Elena Kagan,"What kind of evidence is that, Ms. Anders? So in the 145, an applicant can take all of his written affidavits and say: I want to present oral testimony, on these exact matters, but live? But to the extent the substance of that testimony was something that he could have brought to the PTO, that testimony, in your view, would be out of bounds. But then you really do go back to Justice Ginsburg's question because your understanding of what they wouldn't have a reasonable opportunity to present, I mean, it's very, very narrow. It's a bunch of cumulative testimony that nobody would want to present and no judge would want to hear. And other than that, you are basically saying in all circumstances, well, they could have done that in the PTO. So then you have Justice Ginsburg's problem. Which is, these are two channels that are exactly the same. But I thought that your brief suggested that even with respect to that kind of evidence, a person can go back to the PTO. Is that right? Morgan has very little to say about what types of evidence ought to be admitted in this proceeding. And one thing we could do is to separate out these two things and say, you know, we think that there is a basis for one, for let's say giving the government a fairly deferential standard of review -- call it clear and convincing, call it thorough conviction -- but go the other way, rule against you on the evidentiary point, which Morgan says nothing about? Well, but I guess the compelling reason is the statutory language, and especially with respect to the admissibility of evidence question. I mean, it -- the standard that you suggest just can't be derived from the statutory language, isn't that right? ",what kind of evidence be that ms anders so in the an applicant can take all of his write affidavit and say i want to present oral testimony on these exact matter but live but to the extent the substance of that testimony be something that he could have bring to the pto that testimony in your view would be out of bound but then you really do go back to justice ginsburg s question because your understanding of what they would not have a reasonable opportunity to present i mean it be very very narrow it be a bunch of cumulative testimony that nobody would want to present and no judge would want to hear and other than that you be basically say in all circumstance well they could have do that in the pto so then you have justice ginsburg s problem which be these be two channel that be exactly the same but i think that your brief suggest that even with respect to that kind of evidence a person can go back to the pto be that right morgan have very little to say about what type of evidence ought to be admit in this proceeding and one thing we could do be to separate out these two thing and say you know we think that there be a basis for one for let us say give the government a fairly deferential standard of review call it clear and convincing call it thorough conviction but go the other way rule against you on the evidentiary point which morgan say nothing about well but i guess the compelling reason be the statutory language and especially with respect to the admissibility of evidence question i mean it the standard that you suggest just can not be derive from the statutory language be not that right ,94.14,Roberts Court,"Jan 9, 2012","David J.

2011,FCC v. Fox Television Stations,114,Elena Kagan,"But, General Verrilli, it seems to me that this contract notion of yours can only go so far. I mean, if the idea is just, we gave them something, now they have to do whatever we say, you wouldn't accept that. So the question is why is this condition appropriate when many other conditions would not be appropriate? I mean, tell me if I'm wrong, if you would say all conditions are appropriate. But I -- I frankly think you wouldn't. Well, the broader point, General Verrilli, isn't it, is that no matter -- even if you are right that there are many non-vague applications of this commission policy, that there is some amount of uncertainty and ABC finds itself in that area of uncertainty-- --because it turns out that nudity -- that there really -- sometimes it's allowed as to some body parts and sometimes it's not allowed, and the commission hadn't really said anything about it for 50 years, and the length of time doesn't seem to be what's indicative of anything, the kind of body part doesn't seem to be, with some limits, what is indicative of anything, so that ABC just didn't really know. But this goes-- --We're almost there, right? 10 percent? How about this, Mr. Phillips: Look, you've been given a privilege and that gives the government at least somewhat more leeway to impose obligation on you. Not -- can't impose everything, but at least has a bit more leeway. And here we've had something that's very historically grounded. We've had this for decades and decades that the broadcast is -- the broadcaster is treated differently. It seems to work and it -- it seems to be a good thing that there is some safe haven, even if the old technological bases for that safe haven don't exist anymore. So why not just keep it as it is? Do you think that there is a difference between what a person sees on broadcast channels and what a person sees on basic cable? Basic cable now? No, in content. Is there a difference in content? Because basic cable channels are not restricted by these rules, and I am just wondering whether you think there is a difference. Because I -- it has not been apparent to me that there is. General, I think that the, the networks really are saying: Well, even if some regulation is permissible, the kind of regulation that the FCC has done here is regulation that gives it complete discretion as to what kind of speech to go after and what not to go after; that it has not tied itself in any way to any kinds of standards. And, it's, you know, evident in the notion that this -- the way that this policy seems to work, it's like nobody can use dirty words or nudity except for Steven Spielberg and that there's a lot of room here for FCC enforcement on the basis of what speech they think is kind of nice and proper and good. And so that's a serious First Amendment issue.

2011,"Freeman v. Quicken Loans, Inc.",114,Elena Kagan,"It looks to me as though you have an additional statutory problem. You have two sets of verbs in this statute. One is the ""give and accept"" set of verbs and then the other is the ""charge made or received"". So it seems to me that what this statute is thinking about is at first that there's a charge made or received, and that charge is, of course, the charge that the consumer pays to the provider. And then there's another transaction. And that transaction is the ""give or accept"" transaction, and that transaction occurs between two service providers. So one set of verbs refers to the consumer-provider relationship, the other set of verbs refers to the provider-provider relationship. Mr. Hefferon, if you are right about subsection (b) and its meaning, what does it do that subsection (a) does not do? Well, if that is the case, then why would Congress have done something that says, A, pursuant to an agreement, B, not pursuant to an agreement? Why wouldn't it just have one provision that didn't make any reference to an agreement? Well, Mr. Hefferon, I don't think that is true that -- we defer to agencies, not because we think that agencies do statutory interpretation in exactly the way courts do. We actually defer to agencies because we think they provide something different, not because they are the best parser of statutory language, but because when they see ambiguity they are able to import policy judgments into that ambiguity. And that seems to me exactly what the agency did here. Mr. Hefferon, you might be right that we never get to Chevron deference here because the statute is plain on its face, and there's no ambiguity for the -- the agency to think or do anything about. But let's just assume that there is ambiguity on the statute, and the question is whether to provide this interpretation with Chevron deference. So then, what's your argument for why there should be no Chevron deference to this interpretation, given that the statute under which this interpretation was promulgated refers identically to regulations and interpretations as something that HUD gets to do? That's just a way of saying that there's no ambiguity here. But I was suggesting that if there is ambiguity here, I -- at least I have not found a reason not to give HUD deference in this situation. I mean, you say they didn't do a very good job. But we don't usually grade agencies like that, and say, well, you didn't do a very good job, so you're not entitled to Chevron deference. ",it look to me as though you have an additional statutory problem you have two set of verb in this statute one be the give and accept set of verb and then the other be the charge make or receive so it seem to me that what this statute be think about be at first that there be a charge make or receive and that charge be of course the charge that the consumer pay to the provider and then there be another transaction and that transaction be the give or accept transaction and that transaction occur between two service provider so one set of verbs refers to the consumer provider relationship the other set of verbs refers to the provider provider relationship mr hefferon if you be right about subsection b and its meaning what do it do that subsection a do not do well if that be the case then why would congress have do something that say a pursuant to an agreement b not pursuant to an agreement why would not it just have one provision that do not make any reference to an agreement well mr hefferon i do not think that be true that we defer to agency not because we think that agency do statutory interpretation in exactly the way court do we actually defer to agency because we think they provide something different not because they be the best parser of statutory language but because when they see ambiguity they be able to import policy judgment into that ambiguity and that seem to me exactly what the agency do here mr hefferon you might be right that we never get to chevron deference here because the statute be plain on its face and there be no ambiguity for the the agency to think or do anything about but let us just assume that there be ambiguity on the statute and the question be whether to provide this interpretation with chevron deference so then what be your argument for why there should be no chevron deference to this interpretation give that the statute under which this interpretation be promulgate refers identically to regulation and interpretation as something that hud get to do that be just a way of say that there be no ambiguity here but i be suggest that if there be ambiguity here i at least i have not find a reason not to give hud deference in this situation i mean you say they do not do a very good job but we do not usually grade agency like that and say well you do not do a very good job so you be not entitle to chevron deference ,156.99,Roberts Court,"Feb 21, 2012","Tammy Foret Freeman, et al.,","Quicken Loans, Inc.",10-1042,"Oct 11, 2011","May 24, 2012",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2011,Sackett v. EPA,114,Elena Kagan,"So, Mr. Schiff, your understanding is that each day your clients are subject to $37,500 of fines for the violation of the statute, and an additional 37.5 for violation of the compliance order? Is that the way you understand the penalty scheme to work? Is that -- is that what's critical, Mr. Schiff? If that were not true, if you could go in, even with the compliance order on your property, and get an adjudication of whether you had wetlands in the context of an after-the-fact permit proceeding, would that be sufficient? So why does that matter? You're getting review of the question that you care about, which is the question whether you have wetlands on your property. And if they said you don't have wetlands on your property, here's a permit, your problems are finished. And Mr. Schiff, is the way you see this operating that you bring an action contesting on the basis of the arbitrary and capricious clause or otherwise not in accordance with law? If then the court rules against you but you continue to fail to comply, does the EPA then have to bring a separate enforcement action? But to go back to the Chief Justice's-- --So the Chief Justice's suggestion that there would be preclusion you do not agree with? But, Mr. Stewart-- You are arguing that the presumption of reviewability does not apply. And that seems a very strange position. Why would the presumption of reviewability not apply? But doesn't most of -- 14-- --But Mr. Stewart, you-- --Mr. Stewart, you suggested that, that some communication occurs before this compliance order. And my guess would be that most of the back and forth between the agency and the person does happen before the compliance order rather than after. And the notion that the person can come in after the compliance order and say you were wrong, well they can, but they can do that with respect to any administrative action. So, am I wrong about that? That really the back and forth here takes place before the compliance order issues rather than after? Mr. Schiff, I take it that the government agrees that there's not much of a chance that you could get an after-the-fact permit, but its view is you should have gotten a before-the-fact permit. And putting aside the weirdness which Justice Alito points out of making you go get a permit for something you don't think you need a permit for -- putting that aside, couldn't you have gotten the legal determination that you wanted through that process? Well, I think what EPA is saying was, as long as you knew that your lands were potentially wetlands, you could have gone in from the get-go and -- and sought a determination that they were not wetlands through the permit process. ",so mr schiff your understanding be that each day your client be subject to of fine for the violation of the statute and an additional for violation of the compliance order be that the way you understand the penalty scheme to work be that be that what be critical mr schiff if that we be not true if you could go in even with the compliance order on your property and get an adjudication of whether you have wetland in the context of an after the fact permit proceeding would that be sufficient so why do that matter you be get review of the question that you care about which be the question whether you have wetland on your property and if they say you do not have wetland on your property here s a permit your problem be finish and mr schiff be the way you see this operating that you bring an action contest on the basis of the arbitrary and capricious clause or otherwise not in accordance with law if then the court rule against you but you continue to fail to comply do the epa then have to bring a separate enforcement action but to go back to the chief justice s so the chief justice s suggestion that there would be preclusion you do not agree with but mr stewart you be argue that the presumption of reviewability do not apply and that seem a very strange position why would the presumption of reviewability not apply but do not most of but mr stewart you mr stewart you suggest that that some communication occur before this compliance order and my guess would be that most of the back and forth between the agency and the person do happen before the compliance order rather than after and the notion that the person can come in after the compliance order and say you we be wrong well they can but they can do that with respect to any administrative action so be i wrong about that that really the back and forth here take place before the compliance order issue rather than after mr schiff i take it that the government agree that there be not much of a chance that you could get an after the fact permit but its view be you should have get a before the fact permit and put aside the weirdness which justice alito point out of make you go get a permit for something you do not think you need a permit for put that aside could not you have get the legal determination that you want through that process well i think what epa be say be as long as you know that your land we be potentially wetland you could have go in from the get go and and seek a determination that they we be not wetland through the permit process ,157.27,Roberts Court,"Jan 9, 2012","Chantell Sackett, et vir","Environmental Protection Agency, et al.",10-1062,"Jun 27, 2011","Mar 21, 2012",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2011,Howes v. Fields,114,Elena Kagan,"General, when you say that, I took sometimes your brief and the U.S. Government's brief to be saying something more, which is that it's not all the circumstances; it's all the circumstances minus circumstances that are attendant upon normal prison living. So are you still arguing that, or are you really arguing an all-the-circumstances test? So a court can still think, when it's doing an all-the-circumstances inquiry, it can still factor in something like, you know, it just -- it was going to take him an hour to get back to his cell? That's still something that the court can consider along with everything else. Is that right? Could I ask you a different sort of question, Ms. Anders. Putting aside what the Sixth Circuit did here, if you look back at the initial State Court opinion, do you read the State court -- do you think the State court is fairly read, could the Sixth Circuit have fairly read it, as establishing its own per se rule, which was the per se rule that we rejected in Mathis? In other words, that the State supreme court required some kind of nexus between the prison custody and the interrogation? Well, how is that consistent with the totality of circumstances test that we've always insisted upon in Miranda cases? And where do you get this focus on isolation from? I mean, it's never mentioned in Mathis. You said let's go back to Mathis, but that's not a part of Mathis, is it? Well, do you agree-- --Ms. Jacobs, wouldn't it be fair to say -- it seems to be me that Shatzer must -- excuse me, Mathis must have found that Mr. Mathis -- the Court in Mathis must have found that Mr. Mathis was in custody. That would be a fair inference for Mathis? But we have no idea why the Court thought that Mr. Mathis was in custody. That wasn't at issue in the case. The Court doesn't talk about any of the surrounding factual circumstances. There might have been 1,000 things we don't know about that led everybody to assume -- that was -- that led everybody to assume that Mr. Mathis was in custody. Not the particular things that the Sixth Circuit mentioned. But we don't know why they thought Mathis was in custody. It just wasn't an issue in the case. Everybody had assumed it. ",general when you say that i take sometimes your brief and the us government s brief to be say something more which be that it be not all the circumstance it be all the circumstance minus circumstance that be attendant upon normal prison living so be you still argue that or be you really argue an all the circumstance test so a court can still think when it be do an all the circumstance inquiry it can still factor in something like you know it just it be go to take him an hour to get back to his cell that be still something that the court can consider along with everything else be that right could i ask you a different sort of question ms anders put aside what the sixth circuit do here if you look back at the initial state court opinion do you read the state court do you think the state court be fairly read could the sixth circuit have fairly read it as establish its own per se rule which be the per se rule that we reject in mathis in other word that the state supreme court require some kind of nexus between the prison custody and the interrogation well how be that consistent with the totality of circumstance test that we have always insist upon in miranda case and where do you get this focus on isolation from i mean it be never mention in mathis you say let us go back to mathis but that be not a part of mathis be it well do you agree ms jacob would not it be fair to say it seem to be me that shatzer must excuse me mathis must have find that mr mathis the court in mathis must have find that mr mathis be in custody that would be a fair inference for mathis but we have no idea why the court think that mr mathis be in custody that be not at issue in the case the court do not talk about any of the surround factual circumstance there might have be thing we do not know about that lead everybody to assume that be that lead everybody to assume that mr mathis be in custody not the particular thing that the sixth circuit mention but we do not know why they think mathis be in custody it just be not an issue in the case everybody have assume it ,129.95,Roberts Court,"Oct 4, 2011","Carol Howes, Warden",Randall Lee Fields,10-680,"Jan 24, 2011","Feb 21, 2012",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2011,Gonzalez v. Thaler,114,Elena Kagan,"Just to take a kind of nutty example, Ms. Millett, suppose that a judge took a piece of paper and typed the words ""certificate of appealability"" on top and issued it. Still jurisdiction to take the appeal? So what counts as a certificate of appealability is I guess the question. All you need is those three words and then you have a certificate of appealability? --to which jurisdiction attaches? Well, Ms. Millett, let's take a look at the text of 2244(d)(1). It says limitation shall run from the latest of. And then it gives four dates essentially, four sections, each of which produces a date, A, B, C and D. And A is the one that's concerned here. And A says the date on which the judgment becomes final and then it gives two ways by which a judgment can become final. And the two ways are basically you lose or you quit, right. You lose or you abandon your process. So, I just don't understand your argument, quite honestly, because it seems to me that A says the date, a single date, on which the judgment becomes final. When is that going to happen? Well, for some people it's going to happen when they lose and for other people it's going to happen when they quit. Right. Two ways for it to become final: They lose or they quit. There's no suggestion in section (a) that there is ever going to be a conflict between these two ways of a judgment becoming final. There is no suggestion that one is going to have to pick between them. Subsection (a) is most naturally read -- again it says ""the date"" -- as there is just going to be one date. And some people, the date of finality is going, you know, it becomes final because they lose. Other people, it becomes final because they quit. But subsection (a) suggests a single date, not two dates which you then have to choose between. General Mitchell, but you that C(2) is not jurisdictional, is that correct? You say that C(1) and C(3) are but C(2) is not? If that's right, why? But C(3) says: Shall indicate which specific issues satisfy the showing required by C(2). It just seems as if all of these are a little bit of a piece and, you know, you can stop it at 1 or you can go on to 2 and 3. But it seems to me sort of hard to make the jump here and leave 2 out of it. But then presume, General Mitchell, that he thinks that it does but he just forgot to write down speedy trial. And the question is: Why that forgetting to write down speedy trial should make a difference here given that as Justice Ginsburg said, in any event the court of appeals couldn't reach it because of the procedural issue that it had to reach first. General, it seems to me that Ms. Millett's best argument is an argument just about the oddity of what would happen if we adopt your construction of the statute, which is that the time begins to run before a habeas petitioner actually can file a State habeas petition, and whether that's so odd as to make this a -- a wrong way to construe the statute. Ms.-- --Ms. O'Connell, could I just clarify your argument? You disagree with the State of Texas, isn't that right? Because you think (c)(1), (c)(2) and (c)(3) are all jurisdictional; is that correct? So, I mean, (c)(2) is -- it appears to be a substantive inquiry jurisdictional, that in any case the court is going to have to make this -- is going to have to ask itself whether a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right has been made, and that would seem to be a very odd thing to do for jurisdictional purposes. But in most cases the Federal question inquiry is just look, I'm looking at your complaint; do you cite a Federal statute? Do you cite a Federal constitutional provision? If so, there's a Federal question in the case. What (c)(2) says is have you made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right? That's a very different inquiry. Well is it a jurisdictional rule that we're -- rule that we're going to presume that it's been satisfied? That's a sort of odd thing to do for jurisdictional rules. Right? Jurisdictional rules, we sua sponte have to look at them and we have to be serious about them. Then let's go on to (c)(3), because (c)(3) seems to be just a documentation requirement. In other words, let's presume that (c)(2) has been satisfied; there was a substantial showing made; and there is a documentation error and (c) -- under (c)(3). Why should that be jurisdictional? As sort of -- you know, there has been a substantial showing made. There is a documentation error. It's an error that the habeas Petitioner has absolutely no control over. Why should we view that as a jurisdictional bar? I don't understand that, Miss Millett.

The situation is not presented because the Petitioner did not file a cert petition. Let me make sure I understand you. You're saying 99 percent don't file petitions in Texas's highest court? The argument is that under habeas review these petitioners are not going to be in good shape, right? They are going to have their claims unexhausted or defaulted?

2011,Salazar v. Ramah Navajo Chapter,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Freeman, could I try a hypothetical on you? And it's -- it really is going to this question of what Ferris means. So suppose that there's a government program, and it's to purchase airplanes. And it's -- the authorization language says this is subject to appropriations, in the same way that this language does. And the government, under this program, enters into 10 contracts of a million dollars each to buy 10 airplanes. But then it turns out that Congress appropriates only $9 million, not $10 million. So my question is: Now there are 10 contractors and -- but there's a shortfall of a million dollars-- --do those contractors have contractual rights under Ferris? Yes. So the appropriation has been made. It's a $9 million appropriation. So -- so either one of these airplane manufacturers is going to not have what he contracted for, or all of them are not going to have what they contracted for, because everybody is going to -- their contract is going to be sliced. My understanding, Mr. Freeman, is that that is what Ferris said, was that Ferris said in that situation where it turns out that there's a shortfall but where there are contractual commitments, that -- that the government is bound to live up to those contractual commitments. And if there's a shortfall, then it comes out of the Judgment Fund. Well, but that's partly why I asked you my hypothetical, Mr. Freeman, because I sort of wanted to see whether you would distinguish the hypothetical on that basis-- --but you didn't. You said no, it doesn't really matter. Even if the government is not obligated to enter into contracts, if the government has entered into too many, too bad; we can't make those additional appropriations. But that runs you right into Ferris. Then you're saying that there's no difference between the standard Ferris-type appropriation, which is just an amount of money, and this kind of appropriation, which is up to or not to exceed that amount of money. Mr. Phillips, if you look at this situation, it seems pretty clear that Congress did want to do something, which was to limit the amount of money that was going to the tribes under these contracts. Do you think that there is a way that Congress can do that-- --consistent with this scheme that's set up by the statute? How could Congress do that? You know, if -- if -- if they can't do it this way, how could they? When you say specific limitations, what would that look like? Mr. Phillips, do you think -- and the long question here is what did Congress want. And what -- one answer might be Congress wanted exactly what the government says it wanted. But another answer might be something different, that actually, Congress wanted there to be unlimited funds for these tribes, but that it wanted to shift the costs of some of those funds to the judgment fund outside of the Interior budget. Do you -- I mean, do you contest the government's view of what Congress wanted here? And if so, how? I guess what I don't understand about the government's argument, Mr. Freeman, is exactly what the contractual rights of the tribes become. I mean, as I -- this is supposed to be a contract, and we've held that it's a contract, and usually contracting parties have rights to something. So what do they have a right to in your view? That was -- that was a straightforward question. [Laughter] No, but what do they have a right to with respect to these additional overhead costs? What does each individual tribe have a right to? So you think they do have a right to a pro rata share? In other words, the Secretary could not say, oh, you know, these tribes have been doing a better job, so we'll give to them; or these tribes need it more, so we'll give it to them. You think that there's a contractual right to a pro rata share. This is a very -- this is a very strange kind of contractual right. The -- the contracting tribe has a right to have the Secretary to use discretion to decide how much the contracting tribe gets. What kind of contract is that? [Laughter] No, I'm not contesting -- I mean, clearly you think and the Secretary thinks that there's an obligation to distribute all that money. And -- and I don't think anybody disagrees with that. The question is what each individual tribe has a contractual right to.

2011,Setser v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Jay? Can I -- can I take you back to 3584? So 3584 talks about these two situations, simultaneously imposed terms and undischarged terms, and let's assume that all three sentences talk about only those two situations. The premise of your argument is that in talking about those two situations Congress rejected judicial authority when it came to a third situation. And I guess I want to find out from you why that is. I mean, I want to stipulate, I guess, that nobody had this third situation in mind. The third situation is a very uncommon situation, and so just assume with me that Congress simply just wasn't thinking about this third situation. That's an assumption of the question. What should we do, then? Why would we treat this as exclusive? Well, let's just say Congress just didn't know. It was not on Congress's radar screen. Why would we treat this as exclusive as to this third situation? Well, now you are back with my assumption. You are suggesting that Congress musthave had this third situation in mind. And I'm saying no; the third situation is peculiar, and Congress didn't have it in mind. Then what? Mr. Young, the government says that there are three situations in which this consecutive-concurrent problem comes up. This statute deals with two of them. And the government wants to -- argues that in dealing with two of them it impliedly stated a rule on the third. What's the best argument -- what's your best argument against that? I think that that's not right. It seems to me that the first sentence of this statute grants authority to the courts in these two situations. And the second and third say what happens when that authority isn't exercised. The question I'm struggling with -- and it's the same question I put to Mr. Jay -- is why we should think that the grant of authority over situation A and situation B is a denial of authority over situation C. So what's your best argument? But -- but if one had -- you know, what I take as the view of Justice Alito's question is that there was no -- no practice supporting courts sentencing in this way. It -- it just wasn't done. Mostly, it wasn't on anybody's radar screen that this was a significant issue. What would we do then, if we thought Congress didn't speak to it, but we also didn't see a past practice inconsistent with what the government is suggesting? ",mr jay can i can i take you back to so talk about these two situation simultaneously impose term and undischarged term and let us assume that all three sentence talk about only those two situation the premise of your argument be that in talk about those two situation congress reject judicial authority when it come to a third situation and i guess i want to find out from you why that be i mean i want to stipulate i guess that nobody have this third situation in mind the third situation be a very uncommon situation and so just assume with me that congress simply just be not think about this third situation that be an assumption of the question what should we do then why would we treat this as exclusive well let us just say congress just do not know it be not on congress s radar screen why would we treat this as exclusive as to this third situation well now you be back with my assumption you be suggest that congress musthave have this third situation in mind and I be say no the third situation be peculiar and congress do not have it in mind then what mr young the government say that there be three situation in which this consecutive concurrent problem come up this statute deal with two of them and the government want to argue that in deal with two of them it impliedly state a rule on the third what be the best argument what be your best argument against that i think that that be not right it seem to me that the first sentence of this statute grant authority to the court in these two situation and the second and third say what happen when that authority be not exercise the question I be struggle with and it be the same question i put to mr jay be why we should think that the grant of authority over situation a and situation b be a denial of authority over situation c so what be your best argument but but if one have you know what i take as the view of justice alito s question be that there be no no practice support court sentence in this way it it just be not do mostly it be not on anybody s radar screen that this be a significant issue what would we do then if we think congress do not speak to it but we also do not see a past practice inconsistent with what the government be suggest ,144.16,Roberts Court,"Nov 30, 2011",Monroe Ace Setser,United States,10-7387,"Jun 13, 2011","Mar 28, 2012",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2011,Wood v. Milyard,114,Elena Kagan,"Ms. Lord, could I ask you about the first question presented? As I understand the opposing argument, it goes sort of like this. It says: In Day we said it's fine to do this in the district court; even if the party hasn't raised it, the court can raise it on this exact issue. In Granberry we said with respect to a different issue that the appellate court could raise it; and in Day we said that those two issues were really the same. So that seems sort of like a logical argument that just gets you to a place where you lose on the first question, unless perhaps there is a difference between a court raising a question sua sponte and a court allowing a party to raise it later than the party ought to have raised it. Are you relying on that distinction, or are you questioning the logic of the basic argument that Granberry and Day decided this? But didn't Day say that those two issues were functionally identical for this purpose? But, Mr. Domenico, you're saying something considerably more. You're saying that when a State gets up after inquiry by the district court, when a State gets up and says, we do not want to press this argument, Now we are not saying that the argument is wrong, because after all, we are a repeat player and we are going to hear that argument again. And we are not saying that argument is wrong, but in this case we do not want to press that argument. That's equivocal -- that's unequivocal to me. Mr. Domenico, do I understand your argument correctly to think that if you had not said, or if the lawyer for the State had not we are not conceding, if all that the lawyer for the State had said is, we are not challenging this, Your Honor, would that count as a deliberate waiver under Day? If this is-- --But isn't the concession language really going to a different point? The concession language is going to the point of why it is that you're not raising it, that you're not challenging it. Ms. Sherry, there is one difference, is you put Granberry and Day together, ti gets you most of the way there. The one difference is that here there was sua sponte decision by the Court; whereas, in even the combination of Granberry and Day, it was a party that raised it, although the party raised it late. So why should that difference not matter? If you think that party presentation has some consequence in this area, you might think that that difference does matter; that once you get to the court of appeals and even then the party doesn't raise it, sort of enough is enough. But at the time trial level-- --Of course, the habeas court has a significant screening function. ",ms lord could i ask you about the first question present as i understand the opposing argument it go sort of like this it say in day we say it be fine to do this in the district court even if the party have not raise it the court can raise it on this exact issue in granberry we say with respect to a different issue that the appellate court could raise it and in day we say that those two issue we be really the same so that seem sort of like a logical argument that just get you to a place where you lose on the first question unless perhaps there be a difference between a court raise a question sua sponte and a court allow a party to raise it later than the party ought to have raise it be you rely on that distinction or be you question the logic of the basic argument that granberry and day decide this but do not day say that those two issue we be functionally identical for this purpose but mr domenico you be say something considerably more you be say that when a state get up after inquiry by the district court when a state get up and say we do not want to press this argument now we be not say that the argument be wrong because after all we be a repeat player and we be go to hear that argument again and we be not say that argument be wrong but in this case we do not want to press that argument that be equivocal that be unequivocal to me mr domenico do i understand your argument correctly to think that if you have not say or if the lawyer for the state have not we be not concede if all that the lawyer for the state have say be we be not challenge this your honor would that count as a deliberate waiver under day if this be but be not the concession language really go to a different point the concession language be go to the point of why it be that you be not raise it that you be not challenge it ms sherry there be one difference be you put granberry and day together ti get you most of the way there the one difference be that here there be sua sponte decision by the court whereas in even the combination of granberry and day it be a party that raise it although the party raise it late so why should that difference not matter if you think that party presentation have some consequence in this area you might think that that difference do matter that once you get to the court of appeal and even then the party do not raise it sort of enough be enough but at the time trial level of course the habeas court have a significant screening function ,158.55,Roberts Court,"Feb 27, 2012",Patrick Wood,"Kevin Milyard, Warden, Sterling Correctional Facility, et al.",10-9995,"Sep 27, 2011","Apr 24, 2012",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2011,National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, even since Williams Packing, there was South Carolina v. Regan. And that case can also be understood as a kind of equitable exception to the rule, which would be inconsistent with thinking that the rule is jurisdictional. Mr. Long, aren't there places in this Act -- fees and penalties -- that were specifically put under the Anti-Injunction Act? There is one on health care plans, there is one on pharmaceutical manufacturers, where Congress specifically said the Anti-Injunction Act is triggered for those. It does not say that here. Wouldn't that suggest that Congress meant for a different result to obtain? No, but it -- it in section 9008 and in section 9010-- --it specifically referred to the part of the Code where the Anti-Injunction Act is. But, Mr. Long, aren't you trying to rewrite the statute in a way? The statute has two sections. One is the you have to have insurance section and the other is the sanction. The statute has two different sets of exceptions corresponding to those two different sections. You are trying to suggest that the statute says: Well, it's your choice; either buy insurance or pay a -- or pay a fee. But that's not the way the statute reads. And Congress, it must be supposed, you know, made a decision that that shouldn't be the way the statute reads, that it should instead be a regulatory command and a penalty attached to that command. General, can I ask you about Reed Elsevier? Justice Ginsburg suggested that the language was very similar in Reed Elsevier as it is here, but there are even further similarities. Reed Elsevier pointed out that the provision in question wasn't in Title 28. Here, too, it's not in Title 28. In Reed Elsevier, it was pointed out that the provision there had numerous exceptions to it. Here, too, there are numerous exceptions that we find that have been created by the courts over the years. In Reed Elsevier, the question was essentially one about timing. Come to court after you file your registration. Here, too, the question is one about timing. Come to court after you make -- after you pay your taxes. So Reed Elsevier seems in multiple respects on all fours with this case. Why is that wrong? I take the point-- --but if you would comment on the similarities of Reed Elsevier to this case. How do you think it's different, if at all? Could I-- --The nature of the representation you made, that the only consequence is the penalty, suppose a person does not purchase insurance, a person who is obligated to do so under the statute doesn't do it, pays the penalty instead, and that person finds herself in a position where she is asked the question, have you ever violated any federal law, would that person have violated a federal law? And that's because. But as long as they've paid the penalty. Mr. Katsas, is your basic position when we are talking about the jurisdiction of the district courts a statute has to say it's jurisdictional to be jurisdictional? Well, how would -- I mean, I suppose one could try to make a distinction between this case and Reed Elsevier by focusing on the difference between instituting something and maintaining something, and suggesting that instituting is more what a litigant does, and maintaining, as opposed to dismissing, is more of what judge does. Mr. Katsas, do you think a person who is subject to the mandate but not subject to the penalty would have standing? What would that look like? What would the argument be as to what the injury was? Could I just understand, Mr. Katsas, when the States say that they are injured, are they talking about the people who are eligible now but who are not enrolled? Or are they also talking about people who will become newly eligible? But who are eligible now. But that does seem odd, to suggest that the State is being injured because people who could show up tomorrow with or without this law will -- will show up in greater numbers. I mean, presumably the State wants to cover people whom it has declared eligible for this benefit. General, you've talked on -- a couple of times about other alternatives that Congress might have had, other alternatives that the Respondents suggest to deal with this problem, in particular, the alternative of mandating insurance at the point at which somebody goes to a hospital or an emergency room and asks for care. Did Congress consider those alternatives? Why did it reject them? How should we think about the question of alternative ways of dealing with these problems? And this is especially true, isn't it, General-- --Verrilli, because in this context, the subsidizers eventually become the subsidized? I suppose, though, General, one question is whether the determined efforts of Congress not to refer to this as a tax make a difference. I mean, you're suggesting we should just look to the practical operation. We shouldn't look at labels. And that seems right, except that here we have a case in which Congress determinedly said this is not a tax, and the question is why should that be irrelevant? Well, Mr. Clement, now it seems as though you're just talking about a matter of timing; that Congress can regulate the transaction, and the question is when does it make best sense to regulate that transaction? And Congress surely has within its authority to decide, rather than at the point of sale, given an insurance-based mechanism, it makes sense to regulate it earlier. It's just a matter of timing. Well, doesn't that seem a little bit, Mr. Clement, cutting the bologna thin? I mean, health insurance exists only for the purpose of financing health care. The two are inextricably interlinked. We don't get insurance so that we can stare at our insurance certificate. We get it so that we can go and access health care. But, Mr. Clement, this goes back to the Chief Justice's question. But, of course, the theory behind, not just the government's case, but the theory behind this law is that people are in this market right now, and they are in this market because people do get sick, and because when people get sick, we provide them with care without making them pay. And it that would be different, you know, if you were up here saying, I represent a class of Christian scientists. Then you might be able to say, look, you know, why are they bothering me. But absent that, you're in this market. You're an economic actor. Well, we are talking about the health insurance market, which is designed to access the health care market. Well, once again though, who's in commerce and what are they in commerce? If the effect of all these uninsured people is to raise everybody's premiums, not just when they get sick, if they get sick, but right now in the aggregate, and Wickard and Raich tell us we should look at the aggregate, and the aggregate of all these uninsured people are increasing the normal family premium, Congress says, by a thousand dollars a year. Those people are in commerce. They are making decisions that are affecting the price that everybody pays for this service. Not necessarily, Mr. Clement. And it's different because of the nature of the health care service, that you are entitled to health care when you go to an emergency room, when you go to a doctor, even if you can't pay for it. So the difference between your hypotheticals and the real case is the problem of uncompensated care which-- Well, Mr. Carvin-- --Please. I've forgotten my question. [Laughter] See what it means to be the junior justice? [Laughter] That's why I suggested, Mr. Carvin, that it might be different if you were raising an as-applied challenge and presenting a class of people whom you could say clearly would not be in the health care market. But you're raising a facial challenge and we can't really know which, which of the many, many, people that this law addresses in fact will not participate in the health care market and in fact will not impose costs on all the rest of us. So the question is can Congress respond to those facts, that we have no crystal ball, that we can't tell who is and isn't going to be in the health insurance market, and say most of these people will be and most of these people will thereby impose costs on the rest of us and that's a problem that we can deal with on a class-wide basis? Mr. Carvin, a large part of this argument has concerned the question of whether certain kinds of people are active participants in a market or not active participants in a market. In your test, which is a test that focuses on this activity/inactivity distinction, would force one to confront that problem all the time. Now, if you look over the history of the Commerce Clause, what you see is that there were sort of unhappy periods when the Court used tests like this -- direct versus indirect, commerce versus manufacturing. I think most people would say that those things didn't really work. And the question is, why should this test, inactive versus active, work any better? So Mr. Clement, let's start with the text. Then you suggest, and I think that there is -- this is right, that there is a textual basis for saying that the guaranteed-issue and the community ratings provisions are tied to the mandate. And you said -- you pointed to where that was in the findings. Is there a textual basis for anything else, because I've been unable to find one. It seems to me that if you look at the text, the sharp dividing line is between guaranteed-issue and community ratings on the one hand, everything else on the other. Although the exchanges function perfectly well in Utah where there is no mandate. They function differently, but they function. And the question is always, does Congress want half a loaf. Is half a loaf better than no loaf? And on something like the exchanges it seems to me a perfect example where half a loaf is better than no loaf. The exchanges will do something. They won't do everything that Congress envisioned. Mr. Clement, you just said something which you say a lot in your brief. You say the question is the manner in which it would have operated. And I think that that's not consistent with our cases. And I guess the best example would be Booker where we decided not to sever provisions, notwithstanding that the sentencing guidelines clearly operate in a different manner now than they did when Congress passed them. They operate as advisory rather than mandatory. Well, it's not inconsistent with our practice, right, Mr. Clement? I mean, you have to go back decades and decades and decades, and I'm not sure even then you could find a piece of legislation that we refused to sever for this reason. Mr. Clement-- And Mr. Kneedler, that would be a revolution-- --in our severability law, wouldn't it? I mean, we have never suggested that we were going to say, look, this legislation was a brokered compromise and we are going to try to figure out exactly what would have happened in the complex parliamentary shenanigans that go on across the street and figure out whether they would have made a difference. Instead, we look at the text that's actually given us. For some people, we look only at the text. It should be easy for Justice Scalia's clerks. But the problem, Mr. Farr, isn't it, that they're going to a pool of people that will gradually get older and unhealthier. That's the way the thing works. Once you say that the insurance companies have to cover all of the sick people and all of the old people, the rates climb. More and more young people and healthy people say, why should we participate, we can just get it later when we get sick. So they leave the market, the rates go up further, more people leave the market, and the whole system crashes and burns, becomes unsustainable. And this is not-- --like what I think. What do I know? It's just what's reflected in Congress's findings, that it's look -- it looks at some states and says, this system crashed and burned. It looked at another state with the minimum coverage provision and said, this one seems to work. So we will package the minimum coverage provision with the nondiscrimination provisions. Mr. Farr, I understood that the answer that you gave to Justice Scalia was essentially that the minimum coverage provision was not the heart of the Act. Instead, the minimum coverage provision was a tool to make the nondiscrimination provisions, community rating guaranteed-issue, work. So if you assume that, that all the minimum coverage is is a tool to make those provisions work, then I guess I would refocus Justice Scalia's question and say, if we know that something is just a tool to make other provisions work, shouldn't that be the case in which those other provisions are severed along with the tool? Mr. Clement, can I ask you just a matter of clarification? Would you be making the same argument if instead of the Federal government picked up 90 percent of the cost the Federal government picked up 100 percent of the cost. The exact same argument. So that really reduces to the question of why is a big gift from the Federal government a matter of coercion? In other words, the Federal government is here saying, we are giving you a boatload of money. There are no -- there's no matching funds requirement, there are no extraneous conditions attached to it, it's just a boatload of Federal money for you to take and spend on poor people's healthcare. It doesn't sound coercive to me, I have to tell you. And you do make that argument in your brief, just a stand alone program, a boatload of money, no extraneous conditions, no matching funds, is coercive? Well, let me give you a hypothetical, Mr. Clement. Now, suppose I'm an employer and I see somebody I really like and I want to hire that person. And I say Im going to give you $10 million a year to come work for me. And the person says well, I -- you know, I've never been offered anywhere approaching $10 million a year, of course I'm going to say yes to that. Now we would both be agreed that that's not coercive, right. Wow, wow. I'm offering you $10 million a year to come work for me and you are saying this is anything but a great choice? But, Mr. Clement -- Mr. Clement, can that possibly be. When a taxpayer pays taxes to the Federal government, the person is acting as a citizen of the United States. When a taxpayer pays taxes to New York, a person is acting as a citizen of New York. And New York could no more tell the Federal government what to do with the Federal government's money than the Federal government can tell New York what to do with the moneys that New York is collecting. Mr. Clement-- --Well, if you are right, Mr. Clement, doesn't that mean that Medicaid is unconstitutional now? So, when does a program become too big? I want you to give me a dollar number. So on the third -- on the third, suppose you had the current program and Congress wakes up tomorrow and says ""we think that there's too much fraud and abuse in the program, and we're going to put some new conditions on how the States use this money so we can prevent fraud and abuse, and we're going to tie it to everything that's been there initially. "" Unconstitutional? I guess I don't get the idea. I mean, Congress can legislate fraud and abuse restrictions in Medicaid, and Congress can legislate coverage expansions in Medicaid. Mr. Clement, that is very confusing because the idea behind cooperative Federal/State programs was exactly a federalism idea. It was to give the States the ability to administer those programs. It was to give the States a great deal of flexibility in running those programs. And that's exactly what Medicaid is. Cooperative federalism does not mean that there are no Federal mandates and no Federal restrictions involved in a program that uses 90 percent here, 100 percent Federal money. It means there is flexibility built into the program subject to certain rules that the Federal government has about how it wishes its money to be used. It's like giving a gift certificate. If I give you a gift certificate for one store, you can't use it for other stores. But still you can use it for all kinds of different things. Well, General, what's the -- been the history of its use? Has the Secretary in fact ever made use of that authority? And, General Verrilli-- --General Verrilli, before you do that, I'm sorry, but in response to the Chief Justice's question -- I mean the money or your life has consequence because we are worried that that person is actually going to shoot. So I think that this question about are we -- what do we think the Secretary is going to do is an important one. And as I understand it, I mean when the Secretary withdraws funds, what the Secretary is doing is withdrawing funds from poor people's health care. And that the Secretary is reluctant and loathe to take money away from poor people's health care. And that that's why these things are always worked out. It's that the Secretary really doesn't want to use this power. And so the Secretary sits down with the State and figures out a way for the Secretary not to use the power. But, General Verrilli, you are not willing to give away whether the APA would bar that; but, the APA surely has to apply to a discretionary act of the secretary. ",well even since williams pack there be south carolina v regan and that case can also be understood as a kind of equitable exception to the rule which would be inconsistent with thinking that the rule be jurisdictional mr long be not there place in this act fee and penalty that we be specifically put under the anti injunction act there be one on health care plan there be one on pharmaceutical manufacturer where congress specifically say the anti injunction act be trigger for those it do not say that here would not that suggest that congress mean for a different result to obtain no but it it in section and in section it specifically refer to the part of the code where the anti injunction act be but mr long be not you try to rewrite the statute in a way the statute have two section one be the you have to have insurance section and the other be the sanction the statute have two different set of exception correspond to those two different section you be try to suggest that the statute say well it be your choice either buy insurance or pay a or pay a fee but that be not the way the statute read and congress it must be suppose you know make a decision that that should not be the way the statute read that it should instead be a regulatory command and a penalty attach to that command general can i ask you about reed elsevier justice ginsburg suggest that the language be very similar in reed elsevier as it be here but there be even further similarity reed elsevier point out that the provision in question be not in title here too it be not in title in reed elsevier it be point out that the provision there have numerous exception to it here too there be numerous exception that we find that have be create by the court over the year in reed elsevier the question be essentially one about timing come to court after you file your registration here too the question be one about timing come to court after you make after you pay your tax so reed elsevier seem in multiple respect on all four with this case why be that wrong i take the point but if you would comment on the similarity of reed elsevier to this case how do you think it be different if at all could i the nature of the representation you make that the only consequence be the penalty suppose a person do not purchase insurance a person who be obligate to do so under the statute do not do it pay the penalty instead and that person find herself in a position where she be ask the question have you ever violate any federal law would that person have violate a federal law and that be because but as long as they have pay the penalty mr katsas be your basic position when we be talk about the jurisdiction of the district court a statute have to say it be jurisdictional to be jurisdictional well how would i mean i suppose one could try to make a distinction between this case and reed elsevier by focus on the difference between institute something and maintain something and suggest that institute be more what a litigant do and maintain as oppose to dismiss be more of what judge do mr katsas do you think a person who be subject to the mandate but not subject to the penalty would have standing what would that look like what would the argument be as to what the injury be could i just understand mr katsas when the state say that they be injure be they talk about the people who be eligible now but who be not enrol or be they also talk about people who will become newly eligible but who be eligible now but that do seem odd to suggest that the state be be injure because people who could show up tomorrow with or without this law will will show up in great number i mean presumably the state want to cover people whom it have declare eligible for this benefit general you have talk on a couple of time about other alternative that congress might have have other alternative that the respondent suggest to deal with this problem in particular the alternative of mandate insurance at the point at which somebody go to a hospital or an emergency room and ask for care do congress consider those alternative why do it reject them how should we think about the question of alternative way of deal with these problem and this be especially true be not it general verrilli because in this context the subsidizer eventually become the subsidized i suppose though general one question be whether the determined effort of congress not to refer to this as a tax make a difference i mean you be suggest we should just look to the practical operation we should not look at label and that seem right except that here we have a case in which congress determinedly say this be not a tax and the question be why should that be irrelevant well mr clement now it seem as though you be just talk about a matter of timing that congress can regulate the transaction and the question be when do it make best sense to regulate that transaction and congress surely have within its authority to decide rather than at the point of sale give an insurance base mechanism it make sense to regulate it earlier it be just a matter of timing well do not that seem a little bit mr clement cut the bologna thin i mean health insurance exist only for the purpose of financing health care the two be inextricably interlink we do not get insurance so that we can stare at our insurance certificate we get it so that we can go and access health care but mr clement this go back to the chief justice s question but of course the theory behind not just the government s case but the theory behind this law be that people be in this market right now and they be in this market because people do get sick and because when people get sick we provide them with care without make them pay and it that would be different you know if you we be up here say i represent a class of christian scientist then you might be able to say look you know why be they bother me but absent that you be in this market you be an economic actor well we be talk about the health insurance market which be design to access the health care market well once again though who be in commerce and what be they in commerce if the effect of all these uninsured people be to raise everybody s premium not just when they get sick if they get sick but right now in the aggregate and wickard and raich tell us we should look at the aggregate and the aggregate of all these uninsured people be increase the normal family premium congress say by a thousand dollar a year those people be in commerce they be make decision that be affect the price that everybody pay for this service not necessarily mr clement and it be different because of the nature of the health care service that you be entitle to health care when you go to an emergency room when you go to a doctor even if you can not pay for it so the difference between your hypothetical and the real case be the problem of uncompensated care which well mr carvin please I have forget my question laughter see what it mean to be the junior justice laughter that be why i suggest mr carvin that it might be different if you we be raise an as applied challenge and present a class of people whom you could say clearly would not be in the health care market but you be raise a facial challenge and we can not really know which which of the many many people that this law address in fact will not participate in the health care market and in fact will not impose cost on all the rest of us so the question be can congress respond to those fact that we have no crystal ball that we can not tell who be and be not go to be in the health insurance market and say most of these people will be and most of these people will thereby impose cost on the rest of us and that be a problem that we can deal with on a class wide basis mr carvin a large part of this argument have concern the question of whether certain kind of people be active participant in a market or not active participant in a market in your test which be a test that focus on this activityinactivity distinction would force one to confront that problem all the time now if you look over the history of the commerce clause what you see be that there we be sort of unhappy period when the court use test like this direct versus indirect commerce versus manufacturing i think most people would say that those thing do not really work and the question be why should this test inactive versus active work any good so mr clement let us start with the text then you suggest and i think that there be this be right that there be a textual basis for say that the guaranteed issue and the community rating provision be tie to the mandate and you say you point to where that be in the finding be there a textual basis for anything else because I have be unable to find one it seem to me that if you look at the text the sharp dividing line be between guarantee issue and community rating on the one hand everything else on the other although the exchange function perfectly well in utah where there be no mandate they function differently but they function and the question be always do congress want half a loaf be half a loaf well than no loaf and on something like the exchange it seem to me a perfect example where half a loaf be good than no loaf the exchange will do something they will not do everything that congress envision mr clement you just say something which you say a lot in your brief you say the question be the manner in which it would have operate and i think that that be not consistent with our case and i guess the best example would be booker where we decide not to sever provision notwithstanding that the sentence guideline clearly operate in a different manner now than they do when congress pass them they operate as advisory rather than mandatory well it be not inconsistent with our practice right mr clement i mean you have to go back decade and decade and decade and I be not sure even then you could find a piece of legislation that we refuse to sever for this reason mr clement and mr kneedler that would be a revolution in our severability law would not it i mean we have never suggest that we we be go to say look this legislation be a brokered compromise and we be go to try to figure out exactly what would have happen in the complex parliamentary shenanigan that go on across the street and figure out whether they would have make a difference instead we look at the text that be actually give us for some people we look only at the text it should be easy for justice scalia s clerk but the problem mr farr be not it that they be go to a pool of people that will gradually get old and unhealthier that be the way the thing work once you say that the insurance company have to cover all of the sick people and all of the old people the rate climb more and more young people and healthy people say why should we participate we can just get it later when we get sick so they leave the market the rate go up far more people leave the market and the whole system crash and burn become unsustainable and this be not like what i think what do i know it be just what be reflect in congress s finding that it be look it look at some state and say this system crash and burn it look at another state with the minimum coverage provision and say this one seem to work so we will package the minimum coverage provision with the nondiscrimination provision mr farr i understood that the answer that you give to justice scalia be essentially that the minimum coverage provision be not the heart of the act instead the minimum coverage provision be a tool to make the nondiscrimination provision community rating guaranteed issue work so if you assume that that all the minimum coverage be be a tool to make those provision work then i guess i would refocus justice scalia s question and say if we know that something be just a tool to make other provision work should not that be the case in which those other provision be sever along with the tool mr clement can i ask you just a matter of clarification would you be make the same argument if instead of the federal government

program a boatload of money no extraneous condition no match fund be coercive well let me give you a hypothetical mr clement now suppose I be an employer and i see somebody i really like and i want to hire that person and i say I be go to give you million a year to come work for me and the person say well i you know I have never be offer anywhere approach million a year of course I be go to say yes to that now we would both be agree that that be not coercive right wow wow I be offer you million a year to come work for me and you be say this be anything but a great choice but mr clement mr clement can that possibly be when a taxpayer pay tax to the federal government the person be act as a citizen of the united state when a taxpayer pay tax to new york a person be act as a citizen of new york and new york could no more tell the federal government what to do with the federal government s money than the federal government can tell new york what to do with the money that new york be collect mr clement well if you be right mr clement do not that mean that medicaid be unconstitutional now so when do a program become too big i want you to give me a dollar number so on the third on the third suppose you have the current program and congress wake up tomorrow and say we think that there be too much fraud and abuse in the program and we be go to put some new condition on how the

2011,Christopher v. SmithKline,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Goldstein, doesn't-- Mr. Stewart, there is this other regulation which is I guess in the coverage section, 779.241, which says that if an employee performs any work that in a practical sense is an essential part of consummating the sale of the goods, he will be considered to be selling the goods. So I guess this question is a two-part question. Do you agree that that regulation does cover the -- these detailers? And the second part is, if you do, you know, how does it work that we should understand sale one way for purposes of coverage and another way for purposes of exemption? But that seems a little bit blind to the way the industry actually works. The way this industry actually works is the real work is done by the detailer getting the doctor to say, yeah, I'm going to start prescribing this where it's medically appropriate. The actual sales from the company to the pharmacy just follows from however successful the detailer is. Well, that might be one thing that they are concerned about, but it may not be the only thing. I mean, if you look at these regulations, it seems as though what they are trying to do is draw a distinction between people who actually consummate transactions, transactional people, and people who are pitchmen. And what the Department of Labor here is saying is detailers are people who make pitches; they are not people who consummate the transactions. Why isn't that possible? I mean, your brief seems to suggest that in every industry there needs to be some group of people who would be classified as outside salesmen, and that's not necessarily the case. There may be some industries, and here it's a result of regulation, or it may be because of other business practices, where there just isn't anybody who's an outside salesman. But, Mr. Clement, I thought that in 2004 there were two proposals, really, and one was the proposal that was changed and the other was the proposal to get rid of this promotional stuff and to allow people who promoted products to qualify as outside salesmen, and the agency specifically rejected that suggestion. Well, Mr. Clement-- --I'm sorry. You've suggested-- --I'm sorry. Mr. Clement, I guess I'm not sure I understand what you just said. If -- forget the transfer of title business, but if it's just -- we're requiring a transaction here. And we're drawing a line between people who do transactions and people who just advertise or make pitches or whatever you want to do it. That's perfectly consistent with the statute, isn't it? I mean, you can argue about is it the only possible reading; you can even argue about whether it's the best possible reading. But it's surely a -- a possible reading. I suppose that that's a question. For them, I read their amicus briefs to sort of suggest two things. Sometimes they just talk about transactions, and sometimes they talk about transfer of title. Well, I think that they would say that it doesn't make any difference, because they've never really seen a person who makes transactions without transferring title. So I think that-- --But, Mr. Clement, this isn't a change. You've referred to it as a change in a lot of ways -- in a lot of times, but what we have here is an agency that, for some number of years, thought that this was not the most urgent problem on their plate. Indeed, one would think this is a pretty peculiar Department of Labor if they thought that this was the most urgent problem on their plate. So they didn't enforce it. But now the question has come up, and they say we'll look to our regulations. This falls on one side of the regulation. Now, you've been given a gift for all these years is one way of looking at it, because -- because you were not their most urgent problem, and so they didn't enforce their own regulations against you. But don't you think that the way this works -- I mean, the way we should all hope it works is that the detailer comes in, the detailer provides information, the doctor says, that's very interesting, I want to think about it, I'm going to think about it. Then the doctor reads some medical journals; then maybe the doctor goes to a convention and talks to other doctors about the product. I mean, that's what you would hope that a doctor would do before a doctor decided, I'm going to start prescribing this medicine. And the detail work is a part of that, but so are many things before the doctor actually decides to do something. ",mr goldstein do not mr stewart there be this other regulation which be i guess in the coverage section which say that if an employee performs any work that in a practical sense be an essential part of consummate the sale of the good he will be consider to be sell the good so i guess this question be a two part question do you agree that that regulation do cover the these detailers and the second part be if you do you know how do it work that we should understand sale one way for purpose of coverage and another way for purpose of exemption but that seem a little bit blind to the way the industry actually work the way this industry actually work be the real work be do by the detailer get the doctor to say yeah I be go to start prescribe this where it be medically appropriate the actual sale from the company to the pharmacy just follow from however successful the detailer be well that might be one thing that they be concern about but it may not be the only thing i mean if you look at these regulation it seem as though what they be try to do be draw a distinction between people who actually consummate transaction transactional people and people who be pitchman and what the department of labor here be say be detailers be people who make pitch they be not people who consummate the transaction why be not that possible i mean your brief seem to suggest that in every industry there need to be some group of people who would be classify as outside salesman and that be not necessarily the case there may be some industry and here it be a result of regulation or it may be because of other business practice where there just be not anybody who be an outside salesman but mr clement i think that in there we be two proposal really and one be the proposal that be change and the other be the proposal to get rid of this promotional stuff and to allow people who promote product to qualify as outside salesman and the agency specifically reject that suggestion well mr clement I be sorry you have suggest I be sorry mr clement i guess I be not sure i understand what you just say if forget the transfer of title business but if it be just we be require a transaction here and we be draw a line between people who do transaction and people who just advertise or make pitch or whatever you want to do it that be perfectly consistent with the statute be not it i mean you can argue about be it the only possible reading you can even argue about whether it be the best possible reading but it be surely a a possible reading i suppose that that be a question for them i read their amicus brief to sort of suggest two thing sometimes they just talk about transaction and sometimes they talk about transfer of title well i think that they would say that it do not make any difference because they have never really see a person who make transaction without transfer title so i think that but mr clement this be not a change you have refer to it as a change in a lot of way in a lot of time but what we have here be an agency that for some number of year think that this be not the most urgent problem on their plate indeed one would think this be a pretty peculiar department of labor if they think that this be the most urgent problem on their plate so they do not enforce it but now the question have come up and they say we will look to our regulation this fall on one side of the regulation now you have be give a gift for all these year be one way of look at it because because you we be not their most urgent problem and so they do not enforce their own regulation against you but do not you think that the way this work i mean the way we should all hope it work be that the detailer come in the detailer provide information the doctor say that be very interesting i want to think about it I be go to think about it then the doctor read some medical journal then maybe the doctor go to a convention and talk to other doctor about the product i mean that be what you would hope that a doctor would do before a doctor decide I be go to start prescribe this medicine and the detail work be a part of that but so be many thing before the doctor actually decide to do something ,242.23,Roberts Court,"Apr 16, 2012","Michael Shane Christopher, Frank Buchanan",SmithKline Beecham Corporation d/b/a GlaxoSmithKline,11-204,"Nov 28, 2011","Jun 18, 2012",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2011,Dorsey v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"Do you think that-- --Do you think that if we stick to the language of the statute, if we are, indeed, looking for an express provision, do you agree that there isn't any here? Mr. Estrada, I mean, that's true, that it took Congress a long time to decide to do this, and the question is, once having decided to do this, what did it decide to do; and whether it would make sense, once having decided to do this, to have the guidelines be the new guidelines, but the mandatory minimums be the old mandatory minimums. And what everybody understood was that if that were the case, if the new guidelines and the old mandatory minimums sort of -- both applied together, it would lead to ridiculous disparities in the way people were sentenced. And so the question is, once having decided to do this, can't we assume that Congress decided to do it? But that begs the question-- --Mr. Estrada, before you do, if I can understand your argument as it relates to Justice Scalia's questions -- I just want to make sure I understand it. There's a person who has 4.99 grams of crack cocaine. And you do not dispute, do you, that that person would be subject to the new guidelines, which are based on the 18-to-1 ratio rather than the 100-to-1 ratio? Okay. So you do not dispute that. So -- so then we're living in a world in which the person who has 4.99 grams of cocaine is getting the 18-to-1 ratio, and a person who has 5 grams is getting the 100-to-1 ratio that's embedded in the mandatory minimums. Now, when Judge Easterbrook talked about this anomaly -- and he, of course, adopted the position that you adopted. But he just said, look, there is no earthly reason for this. It's just that we can't find a clear enough statement in the statute. I guess the question I would ask you is: Can you do better than Judge Easterbrook? Can you find an earthly reason for why Congress would have wanted to create this weird halfway system in which you if you have 4-1/2 grams of cocaine, one rule applies, but if you have 5 grams, another rule applies? But could I understand what you are saying, Mr. Estrada? Because if Justice Alito is right, then the new guidelines that the Sentencing Commission has in fact promulgated should not be being applied right now to those who committed crimes before the enactment date. And that's not what's happening now on the ground, is it? ",do you think that do you think that if we stick to the language of the statute if we be indeed look for an express provision do you agree that there be not any here mr estrada i mean that be true that it take congress a long time to decide to do this and the question be once have decide to do this what do it decide to do and whether it would make sense once have decide to do this to have the guideline be the new guideline but the mandatory minimum be the old mandatory minimum and what everybody understood be that if that we be the case if the new guideline and the old mandatory minimum sort of both apply together it would lead to ridiculous disparity in the way people we be sentence and so the question be once have decide to do this can not we assume that congress decide to do it but that beg the question mr estrada before you do if i can understand your argument as it relate to justice scalia s question i just want to make sure i understand it there have a person who have gram of crack cocaine and you do not dispute do you that that person would be subject to the new guideline which be base on the to ratio rather than the to ratio okay so you do not dispute that so so then we be live in a world in which the person who have gram of cocaine be get the to ratio and a person who have gram be get the to ratio that be embed in the mandatory minimum now when judge easterbrook talk about this anomaly and he of course adopt the position that you adopt but he just say look there be no earthly reason for this it be just that we can not find a clear enough statement in the statute i guess the question i would ask you be can you do good than judge easterbrook can you find an earthly reason for why congress would have want to create this weird halfway system in which you if you have gram of cocaine one rule applies but if you have gram another rule applies but could i understand what you be say mr estrada because if justice alito be right then the new guideline that the sentence commission have in fact promulgate should not be be apply right now to those who commit crime before the enactment date and that be not what be happen now on the ground be it ,158.19,Roberts Court,"Apr 17, 2012","Edward Dorsey, Sr.",United States,11-5683,"Nov 28, 2011","Jun 21, 2012",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2011,Elgin v. Department of the Treasury,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Schwartz-- --suppose an employee is fired and he has a variety of different kinds of claims, constitutional and statutory. What would you think happens then? Does he bring the constitutional claims in one court but the statutory claims in another court -- excuse me -- in the -- in the commission? Well, that seems just as bad. In other words, that then, you -- it's not inefficient necessarily, but your scheme would force the employee to choose between her constitutional claims and her statutory claims. Why -- why would we do that? You suggested that it's a situation that doesn't often arise and I guess that puzzles me. Why wouldn't it often arise? Well, why wouldn't the dividing line be -- and I think that this is consistent with your argument -- the dividing line should be where the MSPB itself could decide the claim. If the MSPB can decide the claim, then it goes to the MSPB. If the MSPB can't decide the claim, I think is what you are saying, saying then this has to go to the district court. And you're saying that the MSPB has said that, although it can decide, can decide, cases where he says, you know, my supervisor fired me for a discriminatory reason, that that's within the scope of the MSPB's authority, a claim like this, which is that the Selective Service Act is unconstitutional full stop, is not within the scope of the MSPB's authority. Is that right? And in your original briefs, Mr. Schwartz, you suggested that if the MSPB can't hear a claim, neither can the Federal Circuit. And as I understood the government's brief, the government comes back and said that's not the case. Even when the MSPB can't hear a claim, the Federal Circuit could hear it. Now, then there is a question of if there is a necessity for a record how does the record get developed. But do you now concede that the Federal Circuit could hear the claim as a matter, you know, at the first level? Well, isn't your basic answer to Justice Breyer, I mean correct me if I'm wrong, you think that the problem is that there is no record that the Federal Circuit can use to evaluate this constitutional claim. You could just ask the MSPB, Mr. Feigin. If you bring the claim to the MSPB and then the MSPB says, no, we have no authority to adjudicate this claim, then you know that you're in a world in which the MSPB doesn't have authority, so that you can go to the district court. Well, but the CSRA is presuming that the MSPB actually can decide something. Well, could you help me with something, because I agree with you, Thunder Basin is a very strong case for you, but McNary is a very strong case for Mr. Schwartz. And I read those two opinions and frankly I have a tough time reconciling them. So could you tell me how you do? Yes, I imagine. Well, its very different because the magistrate can come back to the district court judge and say, we have a tough one, Your Honor, why don't you decide it? I mean, here you're stipulating that the board has no power to decide this question. Call it jurisdiction; call it something else. The board cannot decide the question, but the board is going to now become the arbiter of discovery disputes? The fact finder? I mean, weird is a good word for it. Do you think the MSPB should find facts with regard to this claim? I would think, Mr. Feigin, it would depend on how it's litigated. But in a case in which there is some fact finding to be made, would the MSPB have authority to find facts? Well, Mr. Feigin, they might well be the same claim, but if the MSPB can decide the one and cannot decide the other, that's a relevant distinction. Now, you might be right in what you said. Well, maybe one answer is if the MSPB can decide both. But as long as the MSPB can decide the one or the other, it seems, great, I mean, it seems like a sensible dividing line. Well, that's weird in another way, isn't it, Mr. Feigin? Because, can we really imagine in the real world the MSPB deciding that the Selective Service Act is unconstitutional? I mean, what do they know about that question? Well, but this is a question, and -- and you can -- I take the point that I'm just talking about this case. But this is a question about whether women should have to register for the draft in the same way as men should. That goes to defense policy. It goes to equal protection law. It doesn't seem to have anything to do with -- with workplace issues of the kinds that the MSPB is expert on. Mr. Feigin, could I go back to the Chief Justice's question about what actually would happen in the MSPB. Presumably in this case, what the plaintiffs seek to do is to develop an extensive factual record showing how much has changed in the military in terms of the -- the -- the role that women play in the military. And that it's almost impossible to litigate this kind of claim without having such a record. That's the entire basis for -- for arguing that Rostker is outmoded, given current military operations. So how could the -- the plaintiff develop that record that is needed to litigate this claim? Well, this is-- ",mr schwartz suppose an employee be fire and he have a variety of different kind of claim constitutional and statutory what would you think happens then do he bring the constitutional claim in one court but the statutory claim in another court excuse me in the in the commission well that seem just as bad in other word that then you it be not inefficient necessarily but your scheme would force the employee to choose between her constitutional claim and her statutory claim why why would we do that you suggest that it be a situation that do not often arise and i guess that puzzle me why would not it often arise well why would not the dividing line be and i think that this be consistent with your argument the divide line should be where the mspb itself could decide the claim if the mspb can decide the claim then it go to the mspb if the mspb can not decide the claim i think be what you be say say then this have to go to the district court and you be say that the mspb have say that although it can decide can decide case where he say you know my supervisor fire me for a discriminatory reason that that be within the scope of the mspb s authority a claim like this which be that the selective service act be unconstitutional full stop be not within the scope of the mspb s authority be that right and in your original brief mr schwartz you suggest that if the mspb can not hear a claim neither can the federal circuit and as i understand the government s brief the government come back and say that be not the case even when the mspb can not hear a claim the federal circuit could hear it now then there be a question of if there be a necessity for a record how do the record get develop but do you now concede that the federal circuit could hear the claim as a matter you know at the first level well be not your basic answer to justice breyer i mean correct me if I be wrong you think that the problem be that there be no record that the federal circuit can use to evaluate this constitutional claim you could just ask the mspb mr feigin if you bring the claim to the mspb and then the mspb say no we have no authority to adjudicate this claim then you know that you be in a world in which the mspb do not have authority so that you can go to the district court well but the csra be presume that the mspb actually can decide something well could you help me with something because i agree with you thunder basin be a very strong case for you but mcnary be a very strong case for mr schwartz and i read those two opinion and frankly i have a tough time reconcile them so could you tell me how you do yes i imagine well its very different because the magistrate can come back to the district court judge and say we have a tough one your honor why do not you decide it i mean here you be stipulate that the board have no power to decide this question call it jurisdiction call it something else the board can not decide the question but the board be go to now become the arbiter of discovery dispute the fact finder i mean weird be a good word for it do you think the mspb should find fact with regard to this claim i would think mr feigin it would depend on how it be litigate but in a case in which there be some fact find to be make would the mspb have authority to find fact well mr feigin they might well be the same claim but if the mspb can decide the one and can not decide the other that be a relevant distinction now you might be right in what you say well maybe one answer be if the mspb can decide both but as long as the mspb can decide the one or the other it seem great i mean it seem like a sensible dividing line well that be weird in another way be not it mr feigin because can we really imagine in the real world the mspb decide that the selective service act be unconstitutional i mean what do they know about that question well but this be a question and and you can i take the point that I be just talk about this case but this be a question about whether woman should have to register for the draft in the same way as men should that go to defense policy it go to equal protection law it do not seem to have anything to do with with workplace issue of the kind that the mspb be expert on mr feigin could i go back to the chief justice s question about what actually would happen in the mspb presumably in this case what the plaintiff seek to do be to develop an extensive factual record show how much have change in the military in term of the the the role that woman play in the military and that it be almost impossible to litigate this kind of claim without have such a record that be the entire basis for for argue that rostker be outmode give current military operation so how could the the plaintiff develop that record that be need to litigate this claim well this be ,309.67,Roberts Court,"Feb 27, 2012","Michael B.

2011,Maples v. Thomas,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, who says that, Mr. Garre? I mean, is there anything in the record on that point, on the Alabama system generally? Counsel, can I-- --What do we know about Mr. De Leeuw's role, Mr. Garre. Mr. Garre, could we go back to the state of record. You've said a few times, and your brief does, that the record is skimpy on various important matters. Would you go further and say that the record is irretrievably corrupted, tainted by conflicts of interest? The notice inquiry is supposed to be a pragmatic one. As far back as Mullane we've said that the question that we are supposed to ask ourselves is: Is this what somebody would do if they actually wanted to accomplish notice, if they actually wanted the person to get that letter. So I'm just going to ask you, General, if you were a lawyer in an important litigation and you send off an important letter to two lawyers, your principal adversaries, as well as to a local counsel who you think may not be involved in the substance of the litigation, you don't know for a fact, but you think there is some substantial likelihood that he's not particularly involved, as local counsel often aren't. So you send off this letter and you get it back from the principal attorneys, and you ask yourself: Huh, should I do anything now? What would you say? Justice Scalia is right. I am assuming that a letter disposing of a ruling in a capital case issued after 18 months when nobody knew that that letter was coming, that that's an important letter for a death row person to get. So Justice Scalia is right to that effect. So you get this, and you say, well, you would have. But that's the question we have to ask about the clerk as well. The clerk -- The question for the clerk is, if he had really wanted the person to get notice, what would he have done? Mr. Garre, how do we distinguish between abandonment and simply a botched, very botched, transfer of responsibility within the law firm?

2011,Zivotofsky v. Clinton,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, Mr. Lewin, what power is Congress exercising here? Mr. Lewin, this gets back to the question of exactly what congressional power you are basing your argument on. You started by saying you were basing it on Congress's passport power, which is a function of its control over immigration issues. Now you are saying Congress has a co-equal recognition power. Which is it, or is it both? But it's a passport statute that-- --I'm sorry. It's a passport statute that seems to have nothing to do with the immigration functions that passport statutes usually serve. It seems to have everything to do with Congress's declaration of a foreign policy, as opposed to Congress's exercise of power relating to immigration control. So convince me that I am wrong on that. That might be true, Mr. Lewin. I think you would have a better argument if this statute said if you were born in Jerusalem you can pick anything you want in your passport; you can pick Jerusalem, you can pick Israel or you can pick Palestine. But the statute in fact doesn't say that. It says you can pick Israel. So why isn't that a statement of foreign policy as to recognition that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel as opposed to what you are characterizing it as, which is a sort of freedom of sort of choice provision? Well, you have to be very old to say Palestine. Suppose, General Verrilli, suppose that this statute, there was a -- the section that's there now and then there was another section, and the section said: ""The recording of Israel as a place of birth on a passport shall not constitute recognition of Israel's sovereignty over Jerusalem. "" Would that be constitutional? No, my statute has a title which says ""Identification of Persons Born in Jerusalem. "" General Verrilli, is the textural basis for your argument that the President has exclusive power here? Is it the receipt of ambassadors clause alone, or is it something else? Because I was frankly a little bit surprised that your brief put so much weight on that receipt of ambassadors clause, which arguably was meant to give the President a purely ministerial function. And so literally, on any other power that the President has. So if that provision were not in the Constitution, would you be making the same argument you are now? ",well mr lewin what power be congress exercise here mr lewin this get back to the question of exactly what congressional power you be base your argument on you start by say you we be base it on congress s passport power which be a function of its control over immigration issue now you be say congress have a co equal recognition power which be it or be it both but it be a passport statute that I be sorry it be a passport statute that seem to have nothing to do with the immigration function that passport statute usually serve it seem to have everything to do with congress s declaration of a foreign policy as oppose to congress s exercise of power relate to immigration control so convince me that i be wrong on that that might be true mr lewin i think you would have a good argument if this statute say if you we be bear in jerusalem you can pick anything you want in your passport you can pick jerusalem you can pick israel or you can pick palestine but the statute in fact do not say that it say you can pick israel so why be not that a statement of foreign policy as to recognition that jerusalem be the capital of israel as oppose to what you be characterize it as which be a sort of freedom of sort of choice provision well you have to be very old to say palestine suppose general verrilli suppose that this statute there be a the section that be there now and then there be another section and the section say the recording of israel as a place of birth on a passport shall not constitute recognition of israel s sovereignty over jerusalem would that be constitutional no my statute have a title which say identification of person bear in jerusalem general verrilli be the textural basis for your argument that the president have exclusive power here be it the receipt of ambassador clause alone or be it something else because i be frankly a little bit surprise that your brief put so much weight on that receipt of ambassador clause which arguably be mean to give the president a purely ministerial function and so literally on any other power that the president have so if that provision we be not in the constitution would you be make the same argument you be now ,133.03,Roberts Court,"Nov 7, 2011","M.

2011,Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. EEOC,114,Elena Kagan,"Is that correct? Would it mean that any religious teacher is a minister under your theory? So, you know, there may be teachers in religious schools who teach religious subjects, not mathematics, but are not ordained or commissioned in any way as ministers. Are they ministers? Miss Kruger, if I could just clarify for a second there, because you're now sounding as though you want to draw a sharp line between retaliation claims and substantive discrimination claims, and I didn't get that from your brief. So is that, in fact, what you're saying? So are you willing to accept the ministerial exception for substantive discrimination claims, just not for retaliation claims? Do you believe, Miss Kruger, that a church has a right that's grounded in the Free Exercise Clause and-or the Establishment Clause to institutional autonomy with respect to its employees? So this is to go back to Justice Scalia's question, because I too find that amazing, that you think that the Free -- neither the Free Exercise Clause nor the Establishment Clause has anything to say about a church's relationship with its own employees. Mr. Dellinger -- could you assume -- could you assume for me that -- is it-- --I feel like I missed something. Mr. Dellinger, could you assume for me that there is a ministerial exception that's founded in the religion clauses, and tell me who counts as a minister, and why this commissioned minister does not count as a minister? I'm just asking you to assume with me for a moment that there is a categorical exception, and to tell me who you think counts as a minister, and why the woman in this case does not. Mr. Laycock, Mr. Dellinger has some points here about the way in which the ministerial exception relates or doesn't relate to Employment Division v. Smith. And it seems to me that in order to make an argument of the ministerial exception, you in some sense have to say that institutional autonomy is different from individual conscience; that we have said in Smith that state interests can trump individual conscience. And you want us to say that they can't trump institutional autonomy. So why is that?

2011,National Meat Association v. Harris,114,Elena Kagan,"What if it weren't? What if it took place at an auction site apart from the slaughterhouse? Mr. Young, you suggested that even if the Seventh Circuit was correct, there would still be a difference because of ease of identification. You can tell a horse is a horse and keep the horse away from the slaughterhouse. Would it be possible to say the same thing about nonambulatory swine? And I guess my question is, do nonambulatory swine usually become nonambulatory in transit or at the slaughterhouse, or could you identify such swine earlier? Would it be possible-- --Does -- does that mean that a State could actually pass a law and create a facility, let's say, that says -- the law says the trucks have to stop at the State facility before it gets to the slaughterhouse, and at the State facility, we'll check to see whether there are nonambulatory animals, and make sure that those animals don't go on to the slaughterhouse. Would a State be within its rights to do that? Well, is that true, Ms. Smith? I thought that under the Federal program some of these animals could become meat, that under the Federal program you take a nonambulatory animal and you say, well, some of them might be condemned, but some of them are suspect, and if they are only suspect it may be that eventually they will be turned into meat. But that's exactly where the California system diverges from the Federal system, because under the Federal system you separate the animal out and then you take a look at it and then you decide whether that animal can continue to go through the process and eventually become meat or whether you euthanize it. So the California system commands an action that the Federal system say may be necessary but may not be. Well, but the Federal system has said maybe they should be part of the meat supply system. So I suppose what you're saying, Ms. Smith, is that California or any State is entitled to take certain categories of animals outside of the whole process, to exclude certain categories of animals from the whole process and so to exclude them, if you will, from of the scope of this chapter. And much as the Seventh Circuit said a State can simply exclude horses from the scope of this statute, you're saying a State can exclude nonambulatory swine from the scope of this statute. But then you have to, you know, ask yourself the question: Are nonambulatory swine so easily excludable as horses. Why couldn't the State then exclude swine with various kinds of diseases? And then it would be clear that the State was doing something that the Federal statute is supposed to be doing. But suppose, Ms. Smith, you decided that the Secretary was not doing a good job in terms of inspecting for disease. So I guess that there is some disease called diamond skin disease which affects a lot of pigs, and you just thought that the inspection standards were far too lenient; and you said, okay we are not going to allow pigs with diamond skin disease to be slaughtered. Under your theory you could do that, too, isn't that right? But in fact it requires a parallel inspection system. It's trying to do the exact same thing that the Secretary is trying to do, which is trying to remove animals with a certain kind of disease, and it requires an inspection system of its own. In my hypothetical case. And then I think that the cases seem similar to make. ",what if it be not what if it take place at an auction site apart from the slaughterhouse mr young you suggest that even if the seventh circuit be correct there would still be a difference because of ease of identification you can tell a horse be a horse and keep the horse away from the slaughterhouse would it be possible to say the same thing about nonambulatory swine and i guess my question be do nonambulatory swine usually become nonambulatory in transit or at the slaughterhouse or could you identify such swine earlier would it be possible do do that mean that a state could actually pass a law and create a facility let us say that say the law say the truck have to stop at the state facility before it get to the slaughterhouse and at the state facility we will check to see whether there be nonambulatory animal and make sure that those animal do not go on to the slaughterhouse would a state be within its right to do that well be that true ms smith i think that under the federal program some of these animal could become meat that under the federal program you take a nonambulatory animal and you say well some of them might be condemn but some of them be suspect and if they be only suspect it may be that eventually they will be turn into meat but that be exactly where the california system diverges from the federal system because under the federal system you separate the animal out and then you take a look at it and then you decide whether that animal can continue to go through the process and eventually become meat or whether you euthanize it so the california system command an action that the federal system say may be necessary but may not be well but the federal system have say maybe they should be part of the meat supply system so i suppose what you be say ms smith be that california or any state be entitle to take certain category of animal outside of the whole process to exclude certain category of animal from the whole process and so to exclude them if you will from of the scope of this chapter and much as the seventh circuit say a state can simply exclude horse from the scope of this statute you be say a state can exclude nonambulatory swine from the scope of this statute but then you have to you know ask yourself the question be nonambulatory swine so easily excludable as horse why could not the state then exclude swine with various kind of disease and then it would be clear that the state be do something that the federal statute be suppose to be do but suppose ms smith you decide that the secretary be not do a good job in term of inspect for disease so i guess that there be some disease call diamond skin disease which affect a lot of pig and you just think that the inspection standard we be far too lenient and you say okay we be not go to allow pig with diamond skin disease to be slaughter under your theory you could do that too be not that right but in fact it require a parallel inspection system it be try to do the exact same thing that the secretary be try to do which be try to remove animal with a certain kind of disease and it require an inspection system of its own in my hypothetical case and then i think that the case seem similar to make ,212.31,Roberts Court,"Nov 9, 2011",National Meat Association,"Kamala D.

2012,Bailey v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"And what is the immediate vicinity? How would you define that? Well, what if he were aware, or what if there was reason to think he might be aware, would you then allow the police to do what the police did here? Mr. Shanmugam, when you talk about the justifications in your brief and just now, you talk about two; but, there were, in fact, three, and the third was flight. So how is it that that's dropped from your understanding of Summers? Well, Mr. Wall, you have that, too, about the person in her workplace, and you said that your argument didn't apply to the person in her workplace. So you have to come up with something better than that. And I guess the question is your rule would seem to encompass, you know, a whole set of people who are leaving their houses for ordinary reasons: I'm going to work in the morning. And the question is whether the police can stop this person who's going to work in the morning, who's given no indication that he's seen the police officers at the scene, no indication that he's coming back immediately or, you know, in any amount of time that it will take you to complete the search. And that's not an outlier case. It seems to me that the hypothetical I just gave you might very well be the more common case than the hypothetical that you gave me. So, you know, why isn't this just too broad a categorical rule? Right. But the across-the-board is a set of people who are at the house when you want to search the house. And of course, some of this makes perfect sense. You want to search the house, you can't have these people roaming around, right? So you have to detain the people. But what you're now saying is: Well, there's another class of people, they're going to work in the morning. And we've -- there's -- there is no indication that they've seen the police officers; they're going to work. But we get to detain them, too, just because we have a warrant to search the house. And the question is why? I mean, something meaningful very -- very much changes. Before, you're dealing with a problem of a person on the premises while you're trying to search the premises. And now you're talking about a person who is going to work, leaving the premises, letting you search the premises without any interference. ",and what be the immediate vicinity how would you define that well what if he we be aware or what if there be reason to think he might be aware would you then allow the police to do what the police do here mr shanmugam when you talk about the justification in your brief and just now you talk about two but there we be in fact three and the third be flight so how be it that that be drop from your understanding of summer well mr wall you have that too about the person in her workplace and you say that your argument do not apply to the person in her workplace so you have to come up with something well than that and i guess the question be your rule would seem to encompass you know a whole set of people who be leave their house for ordinary reason I be go to work in the morning and the question be whether the police can stop this person who be go to work in the morning who be give no indication that he be see the police officer at the scene no indication that he be come back immediately or you know in any amount of time that it will take you to complete the search and that be not an outlier case it seem to me that the hypothetical i just give you might very well be the more common case than the hypothetical that you give me so you know why be not this just too broad a categorical rule right but the across the board be a set of people who be at the house when you want to search the house and of course some of this make perfect sense you want to search the house you can not have these people roam around right so you have to detain the people but what you be now say be well there be another class of people they be go to work in the morning and we have there be there be no indication that they have see the police officer they be go to work but we get to detain them too just because we have a warrant to search the house and the question be why i mean something meaningful very very much change before you be deal with a problem of a person on the premise while you be try to search the premise and now you be talk about a person who be go to work leave the premise let you search the premise without any interference ,124.54999999999998,Roberts Court,"Nov 1, 2012",Chunon L.

2012,United States v. Bormes,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Srinivasan, what you say has a good deal to recommend it, and it's basically, you know, why should we read the Tucker Act to reverse everything that we know about sovereign immunity, but it's really hard to get that from the text of this -- the Tucker Act. In fact -- I mean, I guess my question is: Do you have any textual argument for the result that you are asking us to reach? Well, that's not really a textual argument. That's an argument about how we've sensibly limited the reach of the Tucker Act. But the Tucker Act does seem to include what your friend there says it includes-- --against any statute. Not any statute except the ones with remedial provisions, but just any statute. Mr. Srinivasan-- --How specific does the other statute have to be? Suppose there were another statute that just said any party can bring suits to enforce any rights against any persons under this statute. Would you be making the same argument? Yes. If that's all the statute says. It just says any party can bring suit to enforce rights under this statute. So there is nor a lot of hoopla and a lot of detail about a remedial scheme. Would you still say that this controls over the Tucker Act? How about if a statute has no remedial provision at all; it just lists a set of legal obligations, but it is a generally applicable statute, it doesn't concern only the United States? Would your argument still apply that the Tucker Act has no force? So then your argument really isn't about another statute having a remedial scheme. In the briefs, you present it as another statute has a remedial scheme, of course you should look to that more particular remedial scheme. But you would take the argument and say, even if the other statute doesn't have a remedial scheme, we don't look to the Tucker Act; we just think of the Tucker Act as having a limitation that is not in the Tucker Act's test -- text in order to make the Tucker Act consistent with everything we thought we knew about principles of sovereign immunity? Mr. Jacobs-- --the -- the import of the government's argument is that if your interpretation governed, we would be facing, really, a quite massive change in the law of sovereign immunity as we've known it until this time. So I will give you an -- Congress decides to pass a statute, and the statute has a cause of action in it. And the drafters say to each other, do we have to say that the government retains sovereign immunity? And everybody says, no, the rules are that if we say nothing at all, the government does retain sovereign immunity. Now, under your world, the next time Congress passes such a statute and that question comes up, you would say, oh, we have to say that the government waives -- retains its sovereign immunity, because if we don't say that, somebody's going to bring an action under the Tucker Act. So for every statute, both the ones that have been written under the old rules and the new ones to come, we have completely flipped the presumption. Now, Congress is going to have to say when it wants to retain sovereign immunity, and if it doesn't -- if it doesn't, the Tucker Act applies, and you get to be in court. I don't think that quite answers the question. That's a -- that's a question about what FCRA means and whether under any standard, whether the fairly arguable standard or the express standard, you should win. And that's a different question. The question is what standard are we going to hold you to. Are we going to say, all you need to show is that it's fairly arguable, or are we going to say, no, unless there's an express statement that the government has waived its sovereign immunity, the government retains it? And as to that, you're asking us to flip the presumption from now on. But Mr. Jacobs, you are trying to evade a certain kind of limitation. The limitation that you are trying to evade is the rule that waivers of sovereign immunity have to be expressed. And that's the rule you are trying to evade by going under the Tucker Act. But then you wouldn't need to go under the Tucker Act. The difference between going under the Tucker Act and going under the statute is the difference between, you know, what -- what standard is a court going to hold you to, to decide whether there has been a waiver of sovereign immunity. ",mr srinivasan what you say have a good deal to recommend it and it be basically you know why should we read the tucker act to reverse everything that we know about sovereign immunity but it be really hard to get that from the text of this the tucker act in fact i mean i guess my question be do you have any textual argument for the result that you be ask us to reach well that be not really a textual argument that be an argument about how we have sensibly limit the reach of the tucker act but the tucker act do seem to include what your friend there say it include against any statute not any statute except the one with remedial provision but just any statute mr srinivasan how specific do the other statute have to be suppose there we be another statute that just say any party can bring suit to enforce any right against any person under this statute would you be make the same argument yes if that be all the statute say it just say any party can bring suit to enforce right under this statute so there be nor a lot of hoopla and a lot of detail about a remedial scheme would you still say that this control over the tucker act how about if a statute have no remedial provision at all it just list a set of legal obligation but it be a generally applicable statute it do not concern only the united state would your argument still apply that the tucker act have no force so then your argument really be not about another statute have a remedial scheme in the brief you present it as another statute have a remedial scheme of course you should look to that more particular remedial scheme but you would take the argument and say even if the other statute do not have a remedial scheme we do not look to the tucker act we just think of the tucker act as have a limitation that be not in the tucker act s test text in order to make the tucker act consistent with everything we think we know about principle of sovereign immunity mr jacob the the import of the government s argument be that if your interpretation govern we would be face really a quite massive change in the law of sovereign immunity as we have know it until this time so i will give you an congress decide to pass a statute and the statute have a because of action in it and the drafter say to each other do we have to say that the government retain sovereign immunity and everybody say no the rule be that if we say nothing at all the government do retain sovereign immunity now under your world the next time congress pass such a statute and that question come up you would say oh we have to say that the government waive retain its sovereign immunity because if we do not say that somebody s go to bring an action under the tucker act so for every statute both the one that have be write under the old rule and the new one to come we have completely flip the presumption now congress be go to have to say when it want to retain sovereign immunity and if it do not if it do not the tucker act applies and you get to be in court i do not think that quite answer the question that be a that be a question about what fcra mean and whether under any standard whether the fairly arguable standard or the express standard you should win and that be a different question the question be what standard be we go to hold you to be we go to say all you need to show be that it be fairly arguable or be we go to say no unless there be an express statement that the government have waive its sovereign immunity the government retain it and as to that you be ask us to flip the presumption from now on but mr jacob you be try to evade a certain kind of limitation the limitation that you be try to evade be the rule that waiver of sovereign immunity have to be express and that be the rule you be try to evade by go under the tucker act but then you would not need to go under the tucker act the difference between go under the tucker act and go under the statute be the difference between you know what what standard be a court go to hold you to to decide whether there have be a waiver of sovereign immunity ,249.7,Roberts Court,"Oct 2, 2012",United States,James X.

2012,Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl,114,Elena Kagan,"But, Ms. Blatt, if he's a parent, why wouldn't some provision in 1912 give him some rights? In other words, what's the point of making him a parent under that definitional section if he doesn't get any of the protections that 1912 provides for when to terminate rights? But what's the point of labeling him a parent if he gets no parental rights under the statute and if the termination provisions don't apply to him? But what are they supposed to-- --Well, how are they significant? I mean, I'm trying to understand this, because if you get notice, but then you have nothing to say in the proceeding because the statute gives you no rights and the statute doesn't provide any standards for terminating those rights-- --what are you supposed to do once you get notice? I think you're not answering the question of what's the point of labeling him a parent if he gets none of the protections that the Act provides to a parent? Ms. Blatt, continuing on the assumption that this man is a parent under the statutory definition, what your argument seems to be suggesting is that there are really two classes of parents under the statute, right, that everybody is labeled a parent, but then there are the parents who get the protections of -- of the termination of rights provision and the parents who don't. And I'm just wondering why if this statute creates two classes of parents it didn't say that in a more upfront kind of way. It seems a strange thing to read into a statute in this sort of backhanded way that there are really two kinds of parents. Well, how does (f) apply? It says “ continued custody ”. That seems to assume that custody exists. So your argument is not that “ continued ” means something different from the normal language; your argument is that “ custody ” means something different from its normal language. Mr. Kneedler, let's say you're right that this man is a parent under the terms of the Act, so not just a biological father but also he has a legal status as parent under this Act. And then 1912 says, well, this is how you go about terminating parental rights, right? But then your argument suggests that one of these clauses applies to him and the other one doesn't, even though he's a parent. But you're saying he only gets some of the protections, that there are really two classes of parents, custodial parents and non. So where does that come from? But as a Federal overlay, Mr. Kneedler, I mean, does it make sense to sort of split apart (d) and (f) in this way? Because (d) is the curing provision that says you have to take steps to try to cure this parent and, you know, to try to make him or her a better parent. And then (f) says here's the standard for terminating parental rights if those curative efforts have failed. Right? So to -- to use -- to have the curative provision but not the standard just seems to -- to make a -- a mess of the statute. ",but ms blatt if he be a parent why would not some provision in give him some right in other word what be the point of make him a parent under that definitional section if he do not get any of the protection that provide for when to terminate right but what be the point of label him a parent if he get no parental right under the statute and if the termination provision do not apply to him but what be they suppose to well how be they significant i mean I be try to understand this because if you get notice but then you have nothing to say in the proceeding because the statute give you no right and the statute do not provide any standard for terminate those right what be you suppose to do once you get notice i think you be not answer the question of what be the point of label him a parent if he get none of the protection that the act provide to a parent ms blatt continue on the assumption that this man be a parent under the statutory definition what your argument seem to be suggest be that there be really two class of parent under the statute right that everybody be label a parent but then there be the parent who get the protection of of the termination of right provision and the parent who do not and I be just wonder why if this statute create two class of parent it do not say that in a more upfront kind of way it seem a strange thing to read into a statute in this sort of backhanded way that there be really two kind of parent well how do f apply it say continue custody that seem to assume that custody exists so your argument be not that continue mean something different from the normal language your argument be that custody mean something different from its normal language mr kneedler let us say you be right that this man be a parent under the term of the act so not just a biological father but also he have a legal status as parent under this act and then say well this be how you go about terminate parental right right but then your argument suggest that one of these clause applies to him and the other one do not even though he be a parent but you be say he only get some of the protection that there be really two class of parent custodial parent and non so where do that come from but as a federal overlay mr kneedler i mean do it make sense to sort of split apart d and f in this way because d be the cure provision that say you have to take step to try to cure this parent and you know to try to make him or her a good parent and then f say here s the standard for terminate parental right if those curative effort have fail right so to to use to have the curative provision but not the standard just seem to to make a a mess of the statute ,172.67999999999995,Roberts Court,"Apr 16, 2013",Adoptive Couple,"Baby Girl, a minor child under the age of fourteen years, Birth Father, and the Cherokee Nation",12-399,"Jan 4, 2013","Jun 25, 2013",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2012,FTC v. Actavis Inc.,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Weinberger, can I just understand what you're saying, and maybe do it through a hypothetical. Suppose you had a -- a lawsuit and the generic sends the brand name manufacturer an e-mail and the e-mail says, we have this lawsuit, I think I have about a 50 percent chance of winning. If I win, I take your -- your monopoly profits down from 100 million to $10 million. Wouldn't it be a good thing if you just gave me 25 million? All right? And then the brand name sends an e-mail back, says -- you know, that seems like a pretty good idea, so I'll give you 25 million. Now, as I understand it, your argument is, I mean, that's just fine. That's hunky dory. Is that fine? Even though -- but what if it isn't in good faith? It's clear what's going on here is that they're splitting monopoly profits and the person who's going to be injured are all the consumers out there. Well, Mr. Weinberger, I think if we give you the rule that you're suggesting we give you, that is going to be the outcome, because this is going to be the incentive of both the generic and the brand name manufacturer in every single case is to split monopoly profits in this way to the detriment of all consumers. Well, I don't think that that's true, Mr. Weinberger, and it's because of something that Justice Scalia suggested, that there's a kind of glitch in Hatch-Waxman, and the glitch is that the 180 days goes to the first filer. And once the 180-day first filer is bought off, nobody else has the incentive to do this. But the -- the huge percentage of the profits is done in the exclusivity period. I mean, it's true that it can go on for a long time, but you're making dribs and drabs of money for a long time. Where you're really making your money is in the 180 days. But it's just an economic-- --I'm sorry, go ahead. Could I just make sure I understand the way the 180-day period worked? The first filer gets it, if I buy off -- if I'm a brand name manufacturer and I buy off the first filer with one of these reverse payments, you're suggesting that that's not going to do me much good because they're all going to be -- there's going to be a long line. And that long line of people, it's not just that they don't get the 180-day period, it's like even if one of those people wins, the person whom I've paid off is going to get the 180-day exclusivity period; isn't that right? But if it's not waived by the parties, in other words, it's just like I don't get it so my incentives go down. It's that my competitor gets it. So why in the world am I standing in line to -- to challenge this if my competitor is going to get the exclusive period? And what's your understanding of why there would not be a long line in some cases or in many cases? And is there anything to show what I think Justice Kennedy asked -- you know, how much of one's profits comes from the 180-day period as opposed to what happens after that?

2012,FTC v. Phoebe Putney Health System,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Horwich, could I just -- before you give examples, just make sure I understand your basic position. Suppose this statement said very clearly that these hospital authorities had the power to engage in acquisitions of hospitals that, for a normal actor, would violate the antitrust laws, but -- but basically said the hospital authorities had the discretion to do that or not. And the state didn't know the hospital authority might do it, but it also might not do it. That would be subject to the immunity; is that correct? Yes. The sheer grant of authority, but the authority is completely discretionary. So the state is basically saying, we don't know; we're going to let the hospital authority figure it out. What I'm trying to get at is the state has put it on the table only as a completely discretionary action. The state has not expressed a preference for it. The state has only said that the hospital authority can think about conditions on the ground in its particular locality and can decide whether such an anticompetitive acquisition is appropriate. So all of this language-- --So all this language in your brief about necessarily and inherently and compelled, all of those things really are not part of your -- your governing test. Mr. Waxman, we do have a brief from quite a number of states, and the brief basically says: We do this all the time; we set up these local authorities, and then we give them powers because they have to act in the world. We give them normal powers, like the ability to make contracts and the ability to buy property. And when we do that, we don't mean that they can do anything they want notwithstanding the antitrust laws. And to construe these very normal powers that we would give to a state entity in order to allow it to operate as a permission to violate the antitrust laws is not at all consistent with our own intentions. Mr. Waxman, could I understand where you think this expressed approval is coming from? Because you said general corporate powers is not enough. So the general ability to buy property, you said, is insufficient. Then you have this idea they have a mission. But the mission can be accomplished in all kinds of ways that are perfectly consistent with the antitrust laws, so that doesn't seem to get you all that far. So what else have you got to show that the State actually thought about this issue and approved this power for the hospital authorities? Mr. Waxman, I mean, that's right, it is about choices, but -- but the question is whether the state has made a choice. And that's what all these cases are about-- --is our trying to find whether the state has made a choice as to this kind of conduct. So now we have your corporate powers aren't enough, your general mission isn't enough. You said a certificate of need, but a certificate of need isn't even given out by this authority. It's something that has nothing to do with the powers of this authority. Then you said there's some kind of a price regulation that happens as to the hospitals that the authority owns, but not with respect to other hospitals. So I guess I'm still looking for the things that show that the state has made a choice that it wants these -- these hospital authorities to be able to make anticompetitive purchases. Where do I find that?

But -- but, General, doesn't the -- the statute make the EAC the decisionmaker with respect to what can be added to the Federal form? The Federal form -- form, you're exactly right, sets a floor.

So I just want to make sure I understand your answer, which is that you read Mitsubishi and Randolph as so narrow that you would say that the principle that they embody does not prevent American Express from saying, you cannot produce -- you cannot use any economic expert or any economic testimony in an antitrust suit. Well, my -- my question is not about class procedures, it's about allowing economic evidence to help prove your claim. And you said, no problem, even though it is, of course, true in the real world that to prove a successful antitrust claim, you need economic evidence. And you said that's fine, because you're going to read Mitsubishi and Randolph in such a way that it allows an arbitration clause to 100 percent effectively absolutely frustrate your ability to bring a Sherman Act suit. Well, I think -- I think what they are saying is something a little bit different, which is that if you go -- if you accept my premise that the arbitration clause could not say no economic evidence, what the Respondents here are saying is, well, now you have to give us the ability to produce economic evidence and maybe that involves class procedures, maybe it involves something else. It could involve some other cost-sharing mechanism. But if the arbitration clause works to prevent us from sharing costs in such a way that we can produce that evidence, then once again we have a problem about completely frustrating the effect of the Sherman Act. Mr. Kellogg, are you suggesting that you can win an antitrust suit in arbitration without presenting economic evidence of such things as monopoly power, antitrust injury, damages? How could somebody do that? Well, Mr. Kellogg, could I go back to Justice Alito's point, because I'm not sure I quite understood your -- your answer to it. Essentially, the claim here, right, is that this is a party with a monopolistic power such that -- and this is just the Plaintiff's allegation, it may or may not be true, but -- but they say that American Express is using its market power to impose particular contract terms. And they have a tying thing, but it could just as easily be the case that American Express could be using its economic power to impose terms essentially making arbitration of antitrust claims impossible. And why shouldn't we understand this problem as connected to the very allegation that's being brought? That, you know, how is it, how is it going to be possible in a case where there's a monopoly power able -- able to impose contracts terms that -- that you can create an arbitration clause which essentially prevents that from being challenged? And, Mr. Kellogg-- --Just to be sure I understand it, that you're saying that it does not violate the confidentiality agreement of this clause to -- to all get together and produce one report? Okay. And did -- did you say that below as well, that -- that the confidentiality clause does not sweep so widely as to prevent this? Because clearly, the court below thought that the confidentiality clause did sweep so widely as to prevent this. So but you're saying the confidentiality position would not apply in that circumstance. And, Mr. -- Mr. Stewart, isn't that also consistent with the way the Court addressed the issue in Randolph? Because what the Court said there was it might be that these arbitration fees are prohibitive. And if those arbitration fees are prohibitive, then this doctrine kicks in. And it didn't look to say, well, let's compare how these fees relate to whatever costs you would wind up with in litigation. It just said, if the arbitration fees are prohibitive in such -- in such a manner that it prevents you from vindicating your Federal claim in arbitration, that's enough. Well, Mr. Kellogg, it does seem like both of the parties have changed what they're saying a bit. And, you know, if this case as presented to us was presented to us in the first instance that the premise was that if you go into arbitration, it would not provide an effective way to vindicate the claim. And, now, people are saying different things about the confidentiality clause, and people may be saying different things about the necessity of an expert. It suggests that the premise on which this case was presented to us was not quite right. ",mr kellogg do you think that if in your arbitration agreement you have a clause which just say i hereby agree not to bring any sherman act claim against american express could could your arbitration agreement do that it it could not right because we would say no there have to be an an opportunity for a vindication of statutory right be that right and and suppose that the arbitration clause say something different suppose that the arbitration clause say i i hereby agree that i will not present any economic evidence in an antitrust action against american express could it do that well even put aside state unconscionability principle would not you think that our mitsubishi case and our randolph case would again come in and say my gosh this arbitration clause prevent any effective vindication of the right to bring an antitrust suit would not you say that so you think I be sorry go ahead so i just want to make sure i understand your answer which be that you read mitsubishi and randolph as so narrow that you would say that the principle that they embody do not prevent american express from say you can not produce you can not use any economic expert or any economic testimony in an antitrust suit well my my question be not about class procedure it be about allow economic evidence to help prove your claim and you say no problem even though it be of course true in the real world that to prove a successful antitrust claim you need economic evidence and you say that be fine because you be go to read mitsubishi and randolph in such a way that it allow an arbitration clause to percent effectively absolutely frustrate your ability to bring a sherman act suit well i think i think what they be say be something a little bit different which be that if you go if you accept my premise that the arbitration clause could not say no economic evidence what the respondent here be say be well now you have to give us the ability to produce economic evidence and maybe that involve class procedure maybe it involve something else it could involve some other cost share mechanism but if the arbitration clause work to prevent us from share cost in such a way that we can produce that evidence then once again we have a problem about completely frustrate the effect of the sherman act mr kellogg be you suggest that you can win an antitrust suit in arbitration without present economic evidence of such thing as monopoly power antitrust injury damage how could somebody do that well mr kellogg could i go back to justice alito s point because I be not sure i quite understood your your

it go to be possible in a case where there be a monopoly power able able to impose contract term that that you can create an arbitration clause which essentially prevent that from be challenge and mr kellogg just to be sure i understand it that you be say that it do not violate the confidentiality agreement of this clause to to all get together and produce one report okay and do do you say that below as well that that the confidentiality clause do not sweep so widely as to prevent this because clearly the court below think that the confidentiality clause do sweep so widely as to prevent this

the premise be that if you go into arbitration it would not provide an effective way to vindicate the claim and now people be say different thing about the confidentiality clause and people may be say

2012,Decker v. Northwest Environmental Defense Center,114,Elena Kagan,"But, Mr. Bishop, as -- as Justice Ginsburg said, that question was not decided below, and in the context of this case, which, of course, was very different when it was briefed, Mr. Fisher spent a grand total of 2 pages, and rightly so. It wasn't -- it was -- it was not the main issue in the case then. So would we really be doing something, you know, a good practice to decide this issue without really any briefing on it and without a decision below? Well, that isn't really quite fair. It is 2 pages because it wasn't decided below and because -- and because the -- the question the -- in the case was very different, with a different regulation. Mr. Bishop, could I -- I'm sorry that I don't understand this well enough yet, but can I understand what's still at stake for you in -- in the case? Put aside the question of whether the new rule is valid or not, all right? And what -- what do you have riding on whether the Ninth Circuit's decision is correct at this point? Which remedies are you worried about? Is what you said true also of the remediation piece of this? You said that at this point even if we understand this as a change in the law, the Plaintiffs would not be entitled to fines. Would they also not be entitled to any kind of remediation? It seems strange that you would -- there would be an order of remediation to undo the results of past discharges when at this point the law going forward is, go ahead and discharge. Mr. Fisher, why would you proceed that way? It's at least arguable that you're wrong on that. I mean, it's a -- it's a question as to what 1369 does. And you obviously do have the route of direct review. Why don't you proceed that way with respect to the new regulation? Do you think that, on your view of 1369, you can't go to the Ninth Circuit?

2012,Moncrieffe v. Holder,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, Mr. Goldstein, assuming he was convicted of that, as you suggest, you have an underinclusiveness problem. The Government has an overinclusiveness problem. If you assume that this statute covers and is regularly used to cover both sets of people, both people with these very minor offenses and people with much more major offenses-- --the at least apparent attractiveness of the Government's position is that they've tried to cure their overinclusiveness problem, and they have done it by sticking on -- and, you know, one can ask where this comes from in the statute-- --but they have done it by sticking on something that attempts to address their overinclusiveness problem, so that people who are really misdemeanants get classified as misdemeanants, and people who are really aggravated felons get classified that way. And you have no similar cure for your underinclusiveness problem, so why shouldn't we go with their problem, which at least attempts to solve this problem? Do you think that the Attorney General could just issue some kind of directive telling all administrative law judges and officials to deny cancellation of removal to anybody who commits these kinds of offenses? To do the exact same thing-- --but through-- --an Attorney General directive. Well, Mr. Shah, the Board may have been doing these inquiries, but I just don't understand the statutory argument, because the way the statute -- the way your own statutory argument runs is that if the conviction, the state conviction, was a conviction for possession with intent to distribute, then those are the elements of a Federal -- of a Federal felony. And so the person -- and an aggravated felony. So you say under the elements approach, this person has committed an aggravated felony. And the statutory directive is that when a person has committed an aggravated felony, he is deportable, and there is no exercise of discretion that can come into play. And so your whole back-end process, which says, oh, well, maybe not, maybe he's not automatically deportable, it doesn't come from the statute, and it seems to run into the statutory language which says an aggravated felon must be deported, the end. Well, that's what the statute says, and that's what your own statutory analysis says. No, I'll just read you, Mr. Shah, this sentence from your brief, and I could read you a thousand of these in your brief: ""Because Petitioner's Georgia conviction necessarily established that he knowingly possessed marijuana with the specific intent to distribute it, that conviction constitutes an aggravated felony. "" Well, if that conviction constitutes an aggravated felony, he has to be deported and there is no exercise of discretion that this statute allows. Well, now you've just put in words into your brief. --and -- and really, truly you say this 10 or 15 times. Mr. Shah, I think the problem with your main argument is that it leads you to a result that you don't want to accept, because your main argument is all we've done in our past cases, and I can argue with this, but your argument is all we've done is compare the elements. But if all we do is compare the elements, then we don't get to your discretionary scheme in which we also admit evidence of the case-specific nature of the offense. I mean, so your arguments all go towards a very purist solution. And then you say, oh, no, that's a crazy solution. It's a crazy solution because we would wind up saying that misdemeanants like this person, like people who are actually convicted under (b)(4) who are clearly misdemeanants, would wind up as aggravated felons and -- and must be deported. I don't think we really have an agreement-- --because it seems to me that Carachuri actually says we don't just look to elements. But if we were just to look to elements in the way you're arguing for, we wouldn't get the result that you're arguing for. I don't think that that is quite right, Mr. Shah, because if you read this statute, what it most looks like is that Congress is simply classifying two different kinds of conduct. Congress has the -- the social sharing conduct, and that's in one section. And the everything else, the more dangerous conduct, is in another section. And so it's not something where it's like, oh, you're trying to get them to negate a specific -- a point. Congress has created two separate sections, two -- and one is a felony, and one is a misdemeanor. And that's the real way to understand this statute. And then, the categorical approach suggests, well, in that case, we accept the underinclusion rather than the overinclusion. I guess I don't understand, Mr. Shah. That seems just a question of labeling to me. I mean, why should we -- why should we accept that labeling rather than, look, what Congress did here was to say that certain kinds of offenses are felonies deserving of grave punishment, and other kinds of offenses are misdemeanors deserving of less than a year in prison, and we see those categories of conduct differently. And if you are saying that if Congress had said two separate offenses, then the categorical approach means that Mr. Goldstein's client wins, I guess I just don't get what in this statute suggests something different for that. Counsel-- ",well mr goldstein assume he be convict of that as you suggest you have an underinclusiveness problem the government have an overinclusiveness problem if you assume that this statute cover and be regularly use to cover both set of people both people with these very minor offense and people with much more major offense the at least apparent attractiveness of the government s position be that they have try to cure their overinclusiveness problem and they have do it by stick on and you know one can ask where this come from in the statute but they have do it by stick on something that attempt to address their overinclusiveness problem so that people who be really misdemeanants get classify as misdemeanants and people who be really aggravate felon get classify that way and you have no similar cure for your underinclusiveness problem so why should not we go with their problem which at least attempt to solve this problem do you think that the attorney general could just issue some kind of directive tell all administrative law judge and official to deny cancellation of removal to anybody who commit these kind of offense to do the exact same thing but through an attorney general directive well mr shah the board may have be do these inquiry but i just do not understand the statutory argument because the way the statute the way your own statutory argument run be that if the conviction the state conviction be a conviction for possession with intent to distribute then those be the element of a federal of a federal felony and so the person and an aggravated felony so you say under the element approach this person have commit an aggravated felony and the statutory directive be that when a person have commit an aggravated felony he be deportable and there be no exercise of discretion that can come into play and so your whole back end process which say oh well maybe not maybe he be not automatically deportable it do not come from the statute and it seem to run into the statutory language which say an aggravated felon must be deport the end well that be what the statute say and that be what your own statutory analysis say no I will just read you mr shah this sentence from your brief and i could read you a thousand of these in your brief because petitioner s georgia conviction necessarily establish that he knowingly possess marijuana with the specific intent to distribute it that conviction constitute an aggravated felony well if that conviction constitute an aggravated felony he have to be deport and there be no exercise of discretion that this statute allow well now you have just put in word into your brief and and really truly you say this or time mr shah i think the problem with your main argument be that it lead you to a result that you do not want to accept because your main argument be all we have do in our past case and i can argue with this but your argument be all we have do be compare the element but if all we do be compare the element then we do not get to your discretionary scheme in which we also admit evidence of the case specific nature of the offense i mean so your argument all go towards a very purist solution and then you say oh no that be a crazy solution it be a crazy solution because we would wind up say that misdemeanants like this person like people who be actually convict under b who be clearly misdemeanants would wind up as aggravated felon and and must be deport i do not think we really have an agreement because it seem to me that carachuri actually say we do not just look to element but if we we be just to look to element in the way you be argue for we would not get the result that you be argue for i do not think that that be quite right mr shah because if you read this statute what it most look like be that congress be simply classify two different kind of conduct congress have the the social sharing conduct and that be in one section and the everything else the more dangerous conduct be in another section and so it be not something where it be like oh you be try to get them to negate a specific a point congress have create two separate section two and one be a felony and one be a misdemeanor and that be the real way to understand this statute and then the categorical approach suggest well in that case we accept the underinclusion rather than the overinclusion i guess i do not understand mr shah that seem just a question of label to me i mean why should we why should we accept that label rather than look what congress do here be to say that certain kind of offense be felony deserve of grave punishment and other kind of offense be misdemeanor deserve of less than a year in prison and we see those category of conduct differently and if you be say that if congress have say two separate offense then the categorical approach mean that mr goldstein s client win i guess i just do not get what in this statute suggest something different for that counsel

2012,Hollingsworth v. Perry,114,Elena Kagan,"Could the State-- --could -- could the State assign to any citizen the rights to defend a judgment of this kind? Well, I just -- if you would on the hypothetical: Could a State just assign to anybody the ability to do this? Mr. Cooper, could I just understand your argument. In reading the briefs, it seems as though your principal argument is that same-sex and opposite -- opposite-sex couples are not similarly situated because opposite-sex couples can procreate, same-sex couples cannot, and the State's principal interest in marriage is in regulating procreation. Is that basically correct? Is -- is there -- so you have sort of a reason for not including same-sex couples. Is there any reason that you have for excluding them? In other words, you're saying, well, if we allow same-sex couples to marry, it doesn't serve the State's interest. But do you go further and say that it harms any State interest? Well, could you explain that a little bit to me, just because I did not pick this up in your briefs. What harm you see happening and when and how and -- what -- what harm to the institution of marriage or to opposite-sex couples, how does this cause and effect work? Well, suppose a State said, Mr. Cooper, suppose a State said that, Because we think that the focus of marriage really should be on procreation, we are not going to give marriage licenses anymore to any couple where both people are over the age of 55. Would that be constitutional? Because that's the same State interest, I would think, you know. If you are over the age of 55, you don't help us serve the Government's interest in regulating procreation through marriage. So why is that different? No, really, because if the couple -- I can just assure you, if both the woman and the man are over the age of 55, there are not a lot of children coming out of that marriage. [Laughter] Actually, I'm not even-- --Well, I just asked about age. I didn't ask about anything else. That's not -- we ask about people's age all the time.

2012,Johnson v. Williams,114,Elena Kagan,"Ms. Brenan, can I ask you what you mean by a plain statement? Because you've said a couple of times a plain statement to the contrary. Justice Sotomayor and Justice Alito have given you hypotheticals, very different from this case, but hypotheticals, where there is, I think, a strong inference that there was no adjudication of the particular Federal claim alleged. You said that's not a plain statement, even though it seems as though there is a strong inference. So what would be a plain statement? Yes, I don't know why they would say that either. Well, by the way, we're not adjudicating this, you know. So if that's your test, your test is an irrebuttable presumption. Could I go back, Ms. Brenan, to your basic theory, because I guess I'm not sure I understand what you're arguing now. In your brief, you talked about focusing on the error. So if evidence was admitted, you would say it doesn't matter that there were three different theories for why the admission of evidence was wrong; you should just look at the fact that we're talking about the admission of evidence. Now, is that what you're arguing, or are you also saying what the states say in their amicus brief, that even if, you know, one claim is about the admission of evidence, and one claim is about ineffective assistance of counsel, you would still apply the same rule? Well, why does your theory make any sense? I mean, we're supposed to be interpreting a statute here that says whether the claim was adjudicated on the merits. Usually when we speak of claims, we speak of legal grounds for relief. We don't look at a claim and say, we'll just check, you know, what -- we don't use an operative facts test, and you seem to be suggesting that that's the kind of test we should use. Well, I may be just repeating some of my colleagues here, but I think if you take this opinion at face value, it cuts against you. I mean, it's a -- they're applying Cleveland. Cleveland is a constitutional decision. It's a Federal constitutional decision. The concurrence makes that completely clear. California has made it completely clear in other cases post Cleveland that it thinks it's applying the Sixth Amendment. Whether it's applying a correct interpretation of the Sixth Amendment is unclear, but it's also completely irrelevant. It thinks it's applying the Sixth Amendment, and it's reaching a Constitutional judgment, isn't it? You're quite right, it does not adopt the consensus standard. It specifically rejects the consensus standard, but it's entitled to do that. As a state court, with no Supreme Court decision that it has to follow, it can say, we have a different view of the Sixth Amendment. I'm just repeating what Justice Alito here said. And that's what it's doing. It's saying, we're applying the Sixth Amendment, we're applying it differently from the way these other courts have done so because we think they're wrong. ",ms brenan can i ask you what you mean by a plain statement because you have say a couple of time a plain statement to the contrary justice sotomayor and justice alito have give you hypothetical very different from this case but hypothetical where there be i think a strong inference that there be no adjudication of the particular federal claim allege you say that be not a plain statement even though it seem as though there be a strong inference so what would be a plain statement yes i do not know why they would say that either well by the way we be not adjudicate this you know so if that be your test your test be an irrebuttable presumption could i go back ms brenan to your basic theory because i guess I be not sure i understand what you be argue now in your brief you talk about focus on the error so if evidence be admit you would say it do not matter that there we be three different theory for why the admission of evidence be wrong you should just look at the fact that we be talk about the admission of evidence now be that what you be argue or be you also say what the state say in their amicus brief that even if you know one claim be about the admission of evidence and one claim be about ineffective assistance of counsel you would still apply the same rule well why do your theory make any sense i mean we be suppose to be interpret a statute here that say whether the claim be adjudicate on the merit usually when we speak of claim we speak of legal ground for relief we do not look at a claim and say we will just check you know what we do not use an operative fact test and you seem to be suggest that that be the kind of test we should use well i may be just repeat some of my colleague here but i think if you take this opinion at face value it cut against you i mean it be a they be apply cleveland cleveland be a constitutional decision it be a federal constitutional decision the concurrence make that completely clear california have make it completely clear in other case post cleveland that it think it be apply the sixth amendment whether it be apply a correct interpretation of the sixth amendment be unclear but it be also completely irrelevant it think it be apply the sixth amendment and it be reach a constitutional judgment be not it you be quite right it do not adopt the consensus standard it specifically reject the consensus standard but it be entitle to do that as a state court with no supreme court decision that it have to follow it can say we have a different view of the sixth amendment I be just repeat what justice alito here say and that be what it be do it be say we be apply the sixth amendment we be apply it differently from the way these other court have do so because we think they be wrong ,175.97000000000003,Roberts Court,"Oct 3, 2012","Deborah K.

2012,Alleyne v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"But why is this not workable? I mean, you can -- you can argue about whether it was right or wrong. You can argue about whether it has created some incongruity in the system. But haven't the last number of years suggested that it's perfectly workable? Everybody knows what they are supposed to do, everybody does it. Why -- why is this not workable? Ms. Maguire, could I take you to a different kind of question? Let's assume that there were a statute and it said carrying a gun is an offense and that the range is 5 to 10 years. I realize it goes up further in the real word, but let's just say 5 to 10 years. And Congress said in setting the penalty within that range the judge shall consider whether the defendant brandished the gun and whether the defendant discharged the gun. Now -- and that's all the statute said. That would be constitutional, is that not right? Okay. So it's constitutional for the judge to say, 7 years because you brandished, 9 years because you discharged. So what makes it unconstitutional, what makes it a violation of the Sixth Amendment, when now Congress just provides something extra in the statute? It says, not just you shall consider brandishing and discharging, but if you find brandishing you get 7, if you find discharging, you get 9. Well, that seems right as a definitional matter, as a descriptive matter. But I guess the question I'm having difficulty with is why does that matter for purposes of the Sixth Amendment? The jury is doing the exact same thing, which is the jury isn't doing anything in either of my examples. So the only difference between example number one, which you said was constitutional, and example number two is that now Congress is giving further instruction to the judge, but nothing more is being taken away from the jury, is it? Well, Apprendi goes both ways. I mean, that's the best sentence for you in Apprendi, but there are other sentences in Apprendi which more go towards what Justice Scalia suggested, that the question was increasing it above the maximum that the jury authorized. So I'm not sure that we can get from the language of Apprendi -- and I guess the question is as a matter of principle. I completely understand why a defendant would care about this. The question is, does it -- does it create a Sixth Amendment violation, which is, you know, the jury has to do this, when -- when Congress is decreasing the judge's discretion, but it's -- either way the jury isn't deciding this. Well, you said, Mr. Dreeben, and -- and I think it's -- it's a great question: Is the jury functioning as a low level gatekeeper under the Harris rule? Because I could make the argument that in fact it is. You know, you take a statute and it says, 5 and up for carrying, and 7 and up for brandishing, right? And this isn't even a hypothetical. This is pretty close to this case. It goes to the jury, the jury says we think he was carrying, we do not think that he was brandishing, all right? And then it goes to the judge. And now the judge says, you know what, if I had my druthers, I would only give 5 years. If I had my druthers, I absolutely would defer to the jury verdict, but I can't defer to the jury verdict because Congress has said I have to make this special factfinding, and the truth of the matter is I think he did brandish, and so I have to give 7 years. So the judge is not deferring to the jury, and he's not deferring to the jury when he would prefer to do so. I guess the question is: Isn't that in every practical sense -- doesn't the mandatory minimum effectively increase the maximum punishment that the -- that the defendant otherwise would get? Yes, but what I'm suggesting is that in the world of judges, you know, this -- the graph you wrote has very little difference in the Harris situation between five and seven, but in fact most judges want to give five. I mean, that's the truth of the matter, that, you know, nobody's given a 97-year sentence. So -- so the action in the criminal justice system is at this lower range. And at this lower range, what the mandatory minimums do is effectively tell a judge that they cannot defer to a jury verdict. I know there are plenty of cases. All I'm saying is it's not the unusual case to find ourselves in exactly this position, where the judge wants to give five, the jury wants to give five, the judge can't defer to the jury's verdict that it should be five. Mr. Dreeben, could I take you back to the principles involved? Let's suppose that instead of this statute, which is 579, you had a statute which was five for carrying, five otherwise and then for brandishing, 40. All right? And maybe if we did discharge, then 60. All right. So a very large gap. Is your argument still the same? But suppose the legislature-- --Suppose -- suppose that Congress is absolutely clear about it, and you say -- and I think that you're right, you've got to be right about this -- it's a constitutional matter, it's the same, but the hypothetical sort of suggests exactly what you said our inquiry ought to be, is that in a world like that, the jury is in fact functioning only as a low level gatekeeper. Isn't that right? And that the only reason we see it in the hypothetical a little bit more clearly is because the numbers are a bit more dramatic. If it's something deeply incongruous, isn't there, where you have an Apprendi rule which says if the maximum is, you know, five to seven, and then the judge says 7 years and a day, we're going to take that out. But as a mandatory minimum that will leapfrog you from five to 40 doesn't get the same result? ",but why be this not workable i mean you can you can argue about whether it be right or wrong you can argue about whether it have create some incongruity in the system but have not the last number of year suggest that it be perfectly workable everybody know what they be suppose to do everybody do it why why be this not workable ms maguire could i take you to a different kind of question let us assume that there we be a statute and it say carry a gun be an offense and that the range be to year i realize it go up far in the real word but let us just say to year and congress say in set the penalty within that range the judge shall consider whether the defendant brandish the gun and whether the defendant discharge the gun now and that be all the statute say that would be constitutional be that not right okay so it be constitutional for the judge to say year because you brandish year because you discharge so what make it unconstitutional what make it a violation of the sixth amendment when now congress just provide something extra in the statute it say not just you shall consider brandishing and discharging but if you find brandish you get if you find discharge you get well that seem right as a definitional matter as a descriptive matter but i guess the question I be have difficulty with be why do that matter for purpose of the sixth amendment the jury be do the exact same thing which be the jury be not do anything in either of my example so the only difference between example number one which you say be constitutional and example number two be that now congress be give further instruction to the judge but nothing more be be take away from the jury be it well apprendi go both way i mean that be the best sentence for you in apprendi but there be other sentence in apprendi which more go towards what justice scalia suggest that the question be increase it above the maximum that the jury authorize so I be not sure that we can get from the language of apprendi and i guess the question be as a matter of principle i completely understand why a defendant would care about this the question be do it do it create a sixth amendment violation which be you know the jury have to do this when when congress be decrease the judge s discretion but it be either way the jury be not decide this well you say mr dreeben and and i think it be it be a great question be the jury functioning as a low level gatekeeper under the harris rule because i could make the argument that in fact it be you know you take a statute and it say and up for carrying and and up for brandishing right and this be not even a hypothetical this be pretty close to this case it go to the jury the jury say we think he be carry we do not think that he be brandish all right and then it go to the judge and now the judge say you know what if i have my druthers i would only give year if i have my druthers i absolutely would defer to the jury verdict but i can not defer to the jury verdict because congress have say i have to make this special factfinding and the truth of the matter be i think he do brandish and so i have to give year so the judge be not defer to the jury and he be not defer to the jury when he would prefer to do so i guess the question be be not that in every practical sense do not the mandatory minimum effectively increase the maximum punishment that the that the defendant otherwise would get yes but what I be suggest be that in the world of judge you know this the graph you write have very little difference in the harris situation between five and seven but in fact most judge want to give five i mean that be the truth of the matter that you know nobody s give a year sentence so so the action in the criminal justice system be at this low range and at this low range what the mandatory minimum do be effectively tell a judge that they can not defer to a jury verdict i know there be plenty of case all I be say be it be not the unusual case to find ourselves in exactly this position where the judge want to give five the jury want to give five the judge can not defer to the jury s verdict that it should be five mr dreeben could i take you back to the principle involve let us suppose that instead of this statute which be you have a statute which be five for carrying five otherwise and then for brandish all right and maybe if we do discharge then all right so a very large gap be your argument still the same but suppose the legislature suppose suppose that congress be absolutely clear about it and you say and i think that you be right you have get to be right about this it be a constitutional matter it be the same but the hypothetical sort of suggests exactly what you say our inquiry ought to be be that in a world like that the jury be in fact function only as a low level gatekeeper be not that right and that the only reason we see it in the hypothetical a little bit more clearly be because the number be a bit more dramatic if it be something deeply incongruous be not there where you have an apprendi rule which say if the maximum be you know five to seven and then the judge say year and a day we be go to take that out but as a mandatory minimum that will leapfrog you from five to do not get the same result ,360.25,Roberts Court,"Jan 14, 2013",Allen Ryan Alleyne,United States,11-9335,"Oct 5, 2012","Jun 17,

2012,Mutual Pharmaceutical Co. v. Bartlett,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Lefkowitz, could I understand something just about the scope of your argument? It -- it seems to me that in this case we are not really dealing with generics; we are also dealing with brand-named drugs. And I guess the -- the thought there would be, in -- with -- with -- in this respect, as to design, as compared to warnings, but as to design, they're really all in the same boat. In other words, you know, they have a design; that it is only that design that's approved. If they change their design there's no authority to continue marketing it. They have to go back to square one. And that's just as true of brand names as it is of generics. So am I right about that? That -- that if we're just looking at a pure design defect claim, putting the warning card aside, where you are in a different position from the brand-name drugs, but as to design, don't the brand-name and the generics go hand in hand? I want you to put that aside for me for just a second, and I understand that's a very significant thing in your argument to put aside. But let's just assume that there was a design defect claim that didn't have to do with warnings, where you are in a different position. Let's just assume on a pure design defect claim, am I right that generics and brand-name manufacturers are in the same position with respect to those claims? Just about how you make the drug? Not what the government, I mean, I myself, I just can't figure out what distinction there would be. So I'm asking you. But, you -- but again, and I know that this is a big part of your argument, but to the extent that a warning was not involved in the claim, and it was just about the design of a drug, I guess I'm asking you, is there any possible way to distinguish between generics and brand-name manufacturers? But, Mr. Lefkowitz, I think in describing the FDCA just now, you used the word “ authorizes ”, and typically, when we think about impossibility, it's not enough that a State law penalizes what Federal law authorizes. What we -- something is impossible when a State law penalizes what Federal law requires or maybe -- or, where State law penalizes what Federal law gives you a right to do. But it's not enough for impossibility that State law penalizes what Federal law permits. And it seems as though what we have in the FDCA is a statute that authorizes, that says, you can sell this. But it doesn't say you must sell it, and it doesn't give you a right to sell it. Well, that is your best case, but, you know, there are quite a number of cases where we've really held when a Federal law permits something, typically, a State can do more if it wants to. I mean, that suggests that there is an obligation of the Federal government. If there is one, yes, there's a conflict and yes, there's an impossibility defense. But if there's no obligation, if all there is, is permission from the Federal government, where do you get the impossibility from? Well, I take that point, Mr. Yang. I take that point, Mr. Yang, but I think then you're -- you're saying something quite deep about the FDCA, which is that the FDCA should not be thought of as merely authorizing drug sales. You're saying essentially that when the -- when the FDA does what it does, it's saying not just -- you know, you can do this if you want to, but you can do this and we really think this drug ought to be marketed. So that when States take action against that, you know, it's -- it's a conflict. And that's-- --and that's something I don't think we've really ever said. Mr. Frederick, it -- it does seem to me, and I understand that there's a waiver argument floating around here, but it does seem to me that this case was litigated such that the adequacy of the warning is really all over this case. There was expert testimony about the adequacy of the warning, there were jury instructions about the adequacy of the warning. In the closing statements that the lawyer gave, it was -- there was a lot of talk about -- that the FDA's decision to change the label, to show that the label was ineffective before. So there is just all over this stuff about adequacy of the warning, which does suggest that this is sort of within the four corners of Mensing. Well, how can that be, Mr. Frederick, because the plaintiff really spent a large portion of their case trying to show this, that the warning was inadequate. So the plaintiff must have thought that there was a possibility that if the warning was adequate, the jury would find one thing, but if the warning was not adequate, liability would follow. There is no such thing then as a brand name manufacturer can change some design features of the drug, you know, without FDA approval or without going back to square one of the FDA, there's nothing like that? ",mr lefkowitz could i understand something just about the scope of your argument it it seem to me that in this case we be not really deal with generic we be also deal with brand name drug and i guess the the thought there would be in with with in this respect as to design as compare to warning but as to design they be really all in the same boat in other word you know they have a design that it be only that design that be approve if they change their design there be no authority to continue market it they have to go back to square one and that be just as true of brand name as it be of generic so be i right about that that that if we be just look at a pure design defect claim put the warn card aside where you be in a different position from the brand name drug but as to design do not the brand name and the generic go hand in hand i want you to put that aside for me for just a second and i understand that be a very significant thing in your argument to put aside but let us just assume that there be a design defect claim that do not have to do with warning where you be in a different position let us just assume on a pure design defect claim be i right that generic and brand name manufacturer be in the same position with respect to those claim just about how you make the drug not what the government i mean i myself i just can not figure out what distinction there would be so I be ask you but you but again and i know that this be a big part of your argument but to the extent that a warning be not involve in the claim and it be just about the design of a drug i guess I be ask you be there any possible way to distinguish between generic and brand name manufacturer but mr lefkowitz i think in describe the fdca just now you use the word authorize and typically when we think about impossibility it be not enough that a state law penalize what federal law authorizes what we something be impossible when a state law penalize what federal law require or maybe or where state law penalize what federal law give you a right to do but it be not enough for impossibility that state law penalize what federal law permit and it seem as though what we have in the fdca be a statute that authorize that say you can sell this but it do not say you must sell it and it do not give you a right to sell it well that be your best case but you know there be quite a number of case where we have really hold when a federal law permit something typically a state can do more if it want to i mean that suggest that there be an obligation of the federal government if there be one yes there be a conflict and yes there be an impossibility defense but if there be no obligation if all there be be permission from the federal government where do you get the impossibility from well i take that point mr yang i take that point mr yang but i think then you be you be say something quite deep about the fdca which be that the fdca should not be think of as merely authorize drug sale you be say essentially that when the when the fda do what it do it be say not just you know you can do this if you want to but you can do this and we really think this drug ought to be market so that when state take action against that you know it be it be a conflict and that be and that be something i do not think we have really ever say mr frederick it it do seem to me and i understand that there be a waiver argument float around here but it do seem to me that this case be litigate such that the adequacy of the warning be really all over this case there be expert testimony about the adequacy of the warning there we be jury instruction about the adequacy of the warning in the closing statement that the lawyer give it be there be a lot of talk about that the fda s decision to change the label to show that the label be ineffective before so there be just all over this stuff about adequacy of the warning which do suggest that this be sort of within the four corner of mensing well how can that be mr frederick because the plaintiff really spend a large portion of their case try to show this that the warning be inadequate so the plaintiff must have think that there be a possibility that if the warning be adequate the jury would find one thing but if the warning be not adequate liability would follow there be no such thing then as a brand name manufacturer can change some design feature of the drug you know without fda approval or without go back to square one of the fda there be nothing like that ,286.66,Roberts Court,"Mar 19, 2013",Mutual Pharmaceutical Co.,Karen L.

2012,Kloeckner v Solis,114,Elena Kagan,"Could I make sure I understand something that you said, Mr. Schnapper. When you talk about the affirmative defenses that the Government can raise, those are exhaustion defenses under the applicable anti-discrimination statute, right? It's whatever exhaustion requirements Title VII sets out or whatever exhaustion requirements the ADEA sets out; is that correct? Those time periods relevant to the MSPB? And would that-- --And would that put the employee who has a mixed case in the same position as an employee who has a straight anti-discrimination case? I'm sorry -- go ahead. I'm sorry. Mr. Schnapper, if I disagree with everything that you just said, I can still rule for you in this case, right? Because there does seem to be a good deal of difference between the question, what happens to something that is clearly a mixed case, and alternatively, the question of whether something is a mixed case; that is, whether it includes a claim about an action which the employee may appeal to the MSPB. And one could think that questions about what can be appealed to the MSPB ought to go to the Federal circuit under this statutory language in a way that questions that are involved in this case do not. Well, that just makes the next case very complicated but it has nothing to do with this case; is that correct? But, Ms. Harrington, go back to the question that the Chief Justice asked you, because the question was: Should we read “ judicially reviewable action ” as something different from action subject to judicial review, which is how you would normally read that language, as something different from just final agency action that you can take to a court. Not saying which court, that you can just take to a court. And you're asking us -- you said it's a term of art. So I guess the next question is: How do you get the definition of the term of art that you say exists in this statute? Yes, it has to be an action that -- you know, the MSPB is done and now you have a certain number of days to take it to a court. So that's the normal way you would read that language. But you say no, it really, you know, it includes some kinds of decisions and not other kinds of decisions and the effect of that is that it's really a switch as to which court you get to take the action to, which is a very counterintuitive way to read this language. So I guess I'm asking you: Where do you find the definition of the term of art? And I think what your answer is going to be is this notion the board shall decide the issue of discrimination and the applicable action; is that correct. I'm sorry. Ms. Harrington, would you agree that this is a remarkably strange way of Congress trying to accomplish this objective? I mean, if Congress were really saying we don't want procedural determinations to go to the district court, that's a very easy thing to say. Congress does not need to send you -- you know, involve six different cross -- references and unnatural reading of statutory language. And, you know, in the end, your argument just is based on this notion that Congress used the word decide rather than dispose of in this single provision. The argument would completely collapse if that were not the case. It just seems like if Congress wanted what you say it wanted, Congress would not have done it in this extremely complicated and backhanded way. But you're not -- the Federal circuit didn't exist at the time that these statutes were written, so what -- you know, really, it would have been taken to the various courts of appeals, and you wouldn't have gotten that uniformity anyway. Right, but Justice Sotomayor is right, that when you define “ judicially reviewable action ” in your way, then 7702(e)(1)(B) becomes nonsensical and you have to save it by inserting additional language, by saying, you know, “ and other ” -- “ and other kinds of action ”. Well, it wouldn't make sense, but it's what the language would command if “ judicially reviewable action ” means what you say “ judicially reviewable means ”. ",could i make sure i understand something that you say mr schnapper when you talk about the affirmative defense that the government can raise those be exhaustion defense under the applicable anti discrimination statute right it be whatever exhaustion requirement title vii set out or whatever exhaustion requirement the adea set out be that correct those time period relevant to the mspb and would that and would that put the employee who have a mixed case in the same position as an employee who have a straight anti discrimination case I be sorry go ahead I be sorry mr schnapper if i disagree with everything that you just say i can still rule for you in this case right because there do seem to be a good deal of difference between the question what happen to something that be clearly a mixed case and alternatively the question of whether something be a mixed case that be whether it include a claim about an action which the employee may appeal to the mspb and one could think that question about what can be appeal to the mspb ought to go to the federal circuit under this statutory language in a way that question that be involve in this case do not well that just make the next case very complicate but it have nothing to do with this case be that correct but ms harrington go back to the question that the chief justice ask you because the question be should we read judicially reviewable action as something different from action subject to judicial review which be how you would normally read that language as something different from just final agency action that you can take to a court not say which court that you can just take to a court and you be ask us you say it be a term of art so i guess the next question be how do you get the definition of the term of art that you say exists in this statute yes it have to be an action that you know the mspb be do and now you have a certain number of day to take it to a court so that be the normal way you would read that language but you say no it really you know it include some kind of decision and not other kind of decision and the effect of that be that it be really a switch as to which court you get to take the action to which be a very counterintuitive way to read this language so i guess I be ask you where do you find the definition of the term of art and i think what your answer be go to be be this notion the board shall decide the issue of discrimination and the applicable action be that correct I be sorry ms harrington would you agree that this be a remarkably strange way of congress try to accomplish this objective i mean if congress we be really say we do not want procedural determination to go to the district court that be a very easy thing to say congress do not need to send you you know involve six different cross reference and unnatural reading of statutory language and you know in the end your argument just be base on this notion that congress use the word decide rather than dispose of in this single provision the argument would completely collapse if that we be not the case it just seem like if congress want what you say it want congress would not have do it in this extremely complicate and backhand way but you be not the federal circuit do not exist at the time that these statute we be write so what you know really it would have be take to the various court of appeal and you would not have get that uniformity anyway right but justice sotomayor be right that when you define judicially reviewable action in your way then e b become nonsensical and you have to save it by insert additional language by say you know and other and other kind of action well it would not make sense but it be what the language would command if judicially reviewable action mean what you say judicially reviewable mean ,256.77000000000004,Roberts Court,"Oct 2, 2012",Carolyn M.

2012,Florida v. Harris,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, Mr. Garre, could I understand your argument? Because -- suppose in a case the Government comes in, says this dog has been through training and the handler has been through training. And this is a case in which -- this is never going to come up when the dog actually alerts to narcotics; it's not worth anybody's time at that point. It's only going to come up in a case like this, where a dog alerts to narcotics, there is no -- there are no narcotics, but something else is found, and so the person ends up being criminally prosecuted. So it's, you know, a small universe of cases. So the Government comes in and says that the dog has been trained. Can -- can the criminal defendant at that point call the handler, say, how has the dog been trained, what are the methods that -- that the dog has -- was used, and how did the dog do in training? Can the -- can the defendant do that. But you can ask questions like how did the dog do in training. And how about if you really, if there were some articles that said, you know, that there was a certain kind of method that, for example, led to a lot of subconscious cueing by the handler. Could the -- could the criminal defendant say, did you use that method that leads to these problematic results? I'm using “ cueing ” not in terms of any intentionality, but one thing that I learned in reading all of this was that one difficulty here is that dogs respond to subconscious cues and that there are different ways of training that make that less or more of a problem. Yes, I didn't mean to say that. I just meant to say that there were -- there were no drugs found. If you take out the Florida supreme court and this one trial court in Massachusetts, basically you think what courts have been doing is the right thing? But where at the same time they'll allow a defendant to question the handler about that training, about how the dog has performed in that training; is that right? ",well mr garre could i understand your argument because suppose in a case the government come in say this dog have be through training and the handler have be through training and this be a case in which this be never go to come up when the dog actually alert to narcotic it be not worth anybody s time at that point it be only go to come up in a case like this where a dog alert to narcotic there be no there be no narcotic but something else be find and so the person end up be criminally prosecute so it be you know a small universe of case so the government come in and say that the dog have be train can can the criminal defendant at that point call the handler say how have the dog be train what be the method that that the dog have be use and how do the dog do in training can the can the defendant do that but you can ask question like how do the dog do in training and how about if you really if there we be some article that say you know that there be a certain kind of method that for example lead to a lot of subconscious cueing by the handler could the could the criminal defendant say do you use that method that lead to these problematic result I be use cue not in term of any intentionality but one thing that i learn in read all of this be that one difficulty here be that dog respond to subconscious cue and that there be different way of training that make that less or more of a problem yes i do not mean to say that i just mean to say that there we be there we be no drug find if you take out the florida supreme court and this one trial court in massachusetts basically you think what court have be do be the right thing but where at the same time they will allow a defendant to question the handler about that training about how the dog have perform in that training be that right ,108.37,Roberts Court,"Oct 31, 2012",Florida,Clayton Harris,11-817,"Mar 26, 2012","Feb 19, 2013",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2012,United States v. Windsor,114,Elena Kagan,"But, Ms. Jackson, I mean, to go back to Justice Kennedy's point, we have injury here in the most classic, most concrete sense. There's $300,000 that's going to come out of the Government's treasury if this decision is upheld, and it won't if it isn't. Now, the Government is willing to pay that $300,000, would be happy to pay that $300,000, but whether the Government is happy or sad to pay that $300,000, the Government is still paying the $300,000, which in the usual set of circumstances is the classic Article III injury. Why isn't it here? But don't we often separate those two things, ask whether there's injury for Article III purposes and causation and redressability, as you say, but then say, well, sometimes when all of those are met, there's not going to be adequate presentation of the arguments, and so we will appoint an amicus or we'll restructure things? And we do that when the Government confesses error, often. I mean, we do that several times a year in this courtroom. Mr. Srinivasan, Chadha says what you said it said about what it means to be aggrieved-- --but Chadha also left open the Article III question. Why did Chadha leave it open if it's the same thing? How about a couple of cases sort of in the middle of the Chief Justice's and this one? So let's say that the Attorney General decides that a particular application of the statute is unconstitutional and decides to give up on that application. Or even let's say the Attorney General decides that the application of the statute might be unconstitutional, so decides to interpret the statute narrowly in order to avoid that application. Could Congress then come in? Mr. Clement, for the most part and historically, the only uniformity that the Federal Government has pursued is that it's uniformly recognized the marriages that are recognized by the State. So, this was a real difference in the uniformity that the Federal Government was pursuing. And it suggests that maybe something -- maybe Congress had something different in mind than uniformity. So we have a whole series of cases which suggest the following: Which suggest that when Congress targets a group that is not everybody's favorite group in the world, that we look at those cases with some -- even if they're not suspect -- with some rigor to say, do we really think that Congress was doing this for uniformity reasons, or do we think that Congress's judgment was infected by dislike, by fear, by animus, and so forth? I guess the question that this statute raises, this statute that does something that's really never been done before, is whether that sends up a pretty good red flag that that's what was going on. Well, is what happened in 1996 -- and I'm going to quote from the House Report here -- is that ""Congress decided to reflect an honor of collective moral judgment and to express moral disapproval of homosexuality. "" Is that what happened in 1996? Yes, but, General, surely the question of what the Federal interests are and whether those Federal interests should take account of the historic State prerogatives in this area is relevant to the equal protection inquiry? ",but ms jackson i mean to go back to justice kennedy s point we have injury here in the most classic most concrete sense there be that be go to come out of the government s treasury if this decision be upheld and it will not if it be not now the government be willing to pay that would be happy to pay that but whether the government be happy or sad to pay that the government be still pay the which in the usual set of circumstance be the classic article iii injury why be not it here but do not we often separate those two thing ask whether there be injury for article iii purpose and causation and redressability as you say but then say well sometimes when all of those be meet there be not go to be adequate presentation of the argument and so we will appoint an amicus or we will restructure thing and we do that when the government confess error often i mean we do that several time a year in this courtroom mr srinivasan chadha say what you say it say about what it mean to be aggrieve but chadha also leave open the article iii question why do chadha leave it open if it be the same thing how about a couple of case sort of in the middle of the chief justice s and this one so let us say that the attorney general decide that a particular application of the statute be unconstitutional and decide to give up on that application or even let us say the attorney general decide that the application of the statute might be unconstitutional so decide to interpret the statute narrowly in order to avoid that application could congress then come in mr clement for the most part and historically the only uniformity that the federal government have pursue be that it be uniformly recognize the marriage that be recognize by the state so this be a real difference in the uniformity that the federal government be pursue and it suggest that maybe something maybe congress have something different in mind than uniformity so we have a whole series of case which suggest the following which suggest that when congress target a group that be not everybody s favorite group in the world that we look at those case with some even if they be not suspect with some rigor to say do we really think that congress be do this for uniformity reason or do we think that congress s judgment be infect by dislike by fear by animus and so forth i guess the question that this statute raise this statute that do something that be really never be do before be whether that send up a pretty good red flag that that be what be go on well be what happen in and I be go to quote from the house report here be that congress decide to reflect an honor of collective moral judgment and to express moral disapproval of homosexuality be that what happen in yes but general surely the question of what the federal interest be and whether those federal interest should take account of the historic state prerogative in this area be relevant to the equal protection inquiry ,204.14,Roberts Court,"Mar 27, 2013",United States,"Edith Windsor, in her capacity as the executor of the estate of Thea Clara Spyer, et al.",12-307,"Dec 7, 2012","Jun 26, 2013",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2012,Maryland v. King,114,Elena Kagan,"But, Ms. Winfree, that can't be quite right, can it? I mean, such a person, assume you've been arrested for something, the State doesn't have the right to go search your house for evidence of unrelated crimes; isn't -- isn't that correct? It doesn't have the right to search your car for evidence of unrelated crimes. Just because you've been arrested doesn't mean that you lose the privacy expectations and things you have that aren't related to the offense that you've been arrested for. Well, and if there were a real identification purpose for this, then I understand that argument. But if it's just to solve cold cases, which is the way you started, then it's just like searching your house, to see what's in your house that could help to solve a cold case. Well, but if that's what you're basing it on, then you're not basing it on an arrestee. I mean, then the Chief Justice is right, it could be any arrestee, no matter how minor the offense. It could be just any old person in the street. Why don't we do this for everybody who comes in for a driver's license because it's very effective? Well, Mr. Dreeben, is it really? Because if this were like fingerprints, I think that you would have a quite good case. But as I've been reading about this, it seems as though the technology is not the same as the fingerprint technology; and because the technology is different, it is used differently. Fingerprints you go in, you put in a fingerprint, there is identifying information that comes back to you in 5 minutes, right? This, you put in something, and Ms. Winfree said was 11 to 17 days, in this case it's four months. And it doesn't seem to be used because the technology doesn't allow it to be used as the kind of routine identifier that fingerprints does. So am I wrong about that? Mr. Dreeben, could I understand how this works exactly? The swab is taken, and if I -- there is a database which is known offenders and there is a database which is kind of crime scene DNA; is that correct? And when the swab is taken and it's put into the system, you check that against the crime scene DNA database; is that correct? Do you check it -- does Maryland check it against the known offenders database? Because that suggests that right now it's functioning as let's solve some crimes, which is a good thing, you know, that we should solve some crimes, but not as an identification device. Because here if it were an identification device you would be comparing it to the known offender database, not to the cold case database. But the typical special needs case is one in which we say there's no law enforcement interest, that there's an interest other than the interest in solving crime. When you started, Mr. Dreeben, you started by saying, you know, they have a reduced expectation of privacy and we have important interests. You went right into free-form balancing. That's typically not the way we do it. If we said to you, look, you know, the way we do it is, you need a warrant, and if you -- there is some exceptions, then you have to put yourself into a well-recognized exception where you can search without a warrant. And that's especially the case when there is no suspicion whatsoever. How would you do it? How would you do it short of free-form balancing? What exception are you a part of? What are your other two distinctions? Mr. Shanmugam, this seems to me a real distinction in this case as it's been litigated. I take what the government is saying is something like: Give us 5 years and those won't look very different. In other words, we will be able to do in 5 years time exactly what we can do with fingerprinting, except it will be, as Justice Breyer says, more accurate. So we are just about 5 years ahead of that, so give us a break. Just suppose -- I mean, I guess the question is would this be unconstitutional? It's not the world we are living in now, but let me -- 10 years from now the government says, we are really switching over to a fingerprint system -- to a DNA system and what that system is going to allow us to do, is it's going to allow us to identify, and it's going to allow us to bring up the old criminal history and it's going to allow us to see whether there are also unsolved crimes that we can tag to this person and discover that he's really, really dangerous. All right? And so the government puts that system into effect. Is it constitutional? ",but ms winfree that can not be quite right can it i mean such a person assume you have be arrest for something the state do not have the right to go search your house for evidence of unrelated crime be not be not that correct it do not have the right to search your car for evidence of unrelated crime just because you have be arrest do not mean that you lose the privacy expectation and thing you have that be not relate to the offense that you have be arrest for well and if there we be a real identification purpose for this then i understand that argument but if it be just to solve cold case which be the way you start then it be just like search your house to see what be in your house that could help to solve a cold case well but if that be what you be base it on then you be not base it on an arrestee i mean then the chief justice be right it could be any arrestee no matter how minor the offense it could be just any old person in the street why do not we do this for everybody who come in for a driver s license because it be very effective well mr dreeben be it really because if this we be like fingerprint i think that you would have a quite good case but as I have be read about this it seem as though the technology be not the same as the fingerprint technology and because the technology be different it be use differently fingerprint you go in you put in a fingerprint there be identify information that come back to you in minute right this you put in something and ms winfree say be to day in this case it be four month and it do not seem to be use because the technology do not allow it to be use as the kind of routine identifier that fingerprint do so be i wrong about that mr dreeben could i understand how this work exactly the swab be take and if i there be a database which be know offender and there be a database which be kind of crime scene dna be that correct and when the swab be take and it be put into the system you check that against the crime scene dna database be that correct do you check it do maryland check it against the known offender database because that suggest that right now it be function as let us solve some crime which be a good thing you know that we should solve some crime but not as an identification device because here if it we be an identification device you would be compare it to the know offender database not to the cold case database but the typical special need case be one in which we say there be no law enforcement interest that there be an interest other than the interest in solve crime when you start mr dreeben you start by say you know they have a reduced expectation of privacy and we have important interest you go right into free form balancing that be typically not the way we do it if we say to you look you know the way we do it be you need a warrant and if you there be some exception then you have to put yourself into a well recognize exception where you can search without a warrant and that be especially the case when there be no suspicion whatsoever how would you do it how would you do it short of free form balancing what exception be you a part of what be your other two distinction mr shanmugam this seem to me a real distinction in this case as it be be litigate i take what the government be say be something like give us year and those will not look very different in other word we will be able to do in year time exactly what we can do with fingerprinting except it will be as justice breyer say more accurate so we be just about year ahead of that so give us a break just suppose i mean i guess the question be would this be unconstitutional it be not the world we be live in now but let me year from now the government say we be really switch over to a fingerprint system to a dna system and what that system be go to allow us to do be it be go to allow us to identify and it be go to allow us to bring up the old criminal history and it be go to allow us to see whether there be also unsolved crime that we can tag to this person and discover that he be really really dangerous all right and so the government put that system into effect be it constitutional ,238.12,Roberts Court,"Feb 26, 2013",Maryland,"Alonzo Jay King, Jr.",12-207,"Nov 9, 2012","Jun 3, 2013",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2012,University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, I guess the question, Mr. Joseffer, is, is there any other discrimination statute in which one can say that there's a different standard for proving retaliation than there is for proving substantive discrimination? Because as I sort of survey the universe, it seems as though whatever the standard is, the standard is the same for both, and there's no statute in which the two have been divorced. Am I wrong about that? I'll try again. Is there any other statute in which we have a different standard of causation for a retaliation claim than we do for a substantive discrimination claim? Well, is there -- I mean, it's but-for everywhere. Is there even any time at which whatever the standard that applied, you know, pre-Gross, is there ever a moment and is there ever a statute in the history of antidiscrimination laws where there has been a divorce, a different standard for retaliation than for substantive discrimination? All I'm saying, you know, Gross was a couple of years ago. It said but-for covers the -- the ABA and outside Title VII. You know, we've had a lot of discrimination statutes since 1964. We've had a lot of different standards applying to those discrimination statutes since 1964. And you're coming in here and asking for the first time in all of those many decades that we should divorce the retaliation claim from the substantive discrimination claim and make them follow two different standards; is that correct? Well, Mr. Joseffer, I mean, Title VII is written before any of these cases come along. So Title VII is written and it says we have an anti -- you know, a substantive antidiscrimination provision, and we have a retaliation provision. And then the Court starts issuing cases. And it says, by the way, you actually don't need both. One will do the job for you, because one includes the other. And that's in Sullivan. And that's in Jackson. And that's in Gomez-Perez, and I'm sure I am missing a few. Three, four, five times, the Court says this. So then in 1991 Congress comes back and it says, we want to make some amendments, what do we have to do? Do we have to amend both, the anti -- the substantive provision and the retaliation provision? Well, no, we have been told five times that as long as we say one it means both. And so that's what Congress does in 1991. Well, but, Mr. Joseffer, in CBOCS, we said that because of Sullivan alone, just because of Sullivan, there was no need for Congress to exclude explicit language about retaliation. In other words, we -- we said Sullivan made the point clear. Now, Justice Alito was right. After that, it goes on. We have done it many more times after 1991. But we have said that Sullivan itself made the point clear that you did not need explicit language about retaliation. I mean, here's what you're ask -- this goes back to Justice Ginsburg's question -- but here's what you're asking us to accept, Mr. Joseffer. Congress comes along in 1991 in a world in which there has -- there have never been separate standards for retaliation and substantive discrimination. Congress is trying to codify and make even stronger the Price Waterhouse decision, right? They -- you know, they say, basically, we like Price Waterhouse, but it's kind of confused and the court was kind of fractured. We're going to really put it into place legislatively. They do that, they follow the -- essentially the drafting manuals that we have given them in Sullivan. And you're saying, well, no. What they really meant was that retaliation would have a different standard and, indeed, retaliation would have a standard that the dissenting justices suggested in Price Waterhouse, notwithstanding what Congress was clearly intending to do was codify the majority -- the plurality-plus position. Well, Gross is talking about outside of Title VII. And -- and whatever might be said of Gross outside of Title VII, here, where Congress is specifically trying to make Title VII conform with Price Waterhouse, with the backdrop of our legislative drafting instructions, and with the backdrop of never distinguishing between retaliation and antidiscrimination, you know, how do you get to where you want to be? This would be, like -- talk about elephants in mouse holes or talk about -- you know, we can take up all our cliches, the dog that didn't bark. You know, Congress doesn't do things like this without saying something. ",well i guess the question mr joseffer be be there any other discrimination statute in which one can say that there be a different standard for prove retaliation than there be for prove substantive discrimination because as i sort of survey the universe it seem as though whatever the standard be the standard be the same for both and there be no statute in which the two have be divorce be i wrong about that I will try again be there any other statute in which we have a different standard of causation for a retaliation claim than we do for a substantive discrimination claim well be there i mean it be but for everywhere be there even any time at which whatever the standard that apply you know pre gross be there ever a moment and be there ever a statute in the history of antidiscrimination law where there have be a divorce a different standard for retaliation than for substantive discrimination all I be say you know gross be a couple of year ago it say but for cover the the aba and outside title vii you know we have have a lot of discrimination statute since we have have a lot of different standard apply to those discrimination statute since and you be come in here and ask for the first time in all of those many decade that we should divorce the retaliation claim from the substantive discrimination claim and make them follow two different standard be that correct well mr joseffer i mean title vii be write before any of these case come along so title vii be write and it say we have an anti you know a substantive antidiscrimination provision and we have a retaliation provision and then the court start issue case and it say by the way you actually do not need both one will do the job for you because one include the other and that be in sullivan and that be in jackson and that be in gomez perez and I be sure i be miss a few three four five time the court say this so then in congress come back and it say we want to make some amendment what do we have to do do we have to amend both the anti the substantive provision and the retaliation provision well no we have be tell five time that as long as we say one it mean both and so that be what congress do in well but mr joseffer in cbocs we say that because of sullivan alone just because of sullivan there be no need for congress to exclude explicit language about retaliation in other word we we say sullivan make the point clear now justice alito be right after that it go on we have do it many more time after but we have say that sullivan itself make the point clear that you do not need explicit language about retaliation i mean here s what you be ask this go back to justice ginsburg s question but here s what you be ask us to accept mr joseffer congress come along in in a world in which there have there have never be separate standard for retaliation and substantive discrimination congress be try to codify and make even strong the price waterhouse decision right they you know they say basically we like price waterhouse but it be kind of confused and the court be kind of fracture we be go to really put it into place legislatively they do that they follow the essentially the drafting manual that we have give them in sullivan and you be say well no what they really mean be that retaliation would have a different standard and indeed retaliation would have a standard that the dissenting justice suggest in price waterhouse notwithstanding what congress be clearly intend to do be codify the majority the plurality plus position well gross be talk about outside of title vii and and whatever might be say of gross outside of title vii here where congress be specifically try to make title vii conform with price waterhouse with the backdrop of our legislative drafting instruction and with the backdrop of never distinguish between retaliation and antidiscrimination you know how do you get to where you want to be this would be like talk about elephant in mouse hole or talk about you know we can take up all our cliche the dog that do not bark you know congress do not do thing like this without say something ,281.6299999999999,Roberts Court,"Apr 24, 2013",University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center,Naiel Nassar,12-484,"Jan 18, 2013","Jun 24, 2013",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2012,Bowman v. Monsanto,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, except to the extent, as Justice Breyer suggested, except to the extent that the purchase is going to use the article just to create a new one of the exact same kind. And it seems to me that what you're suggesting is that the basic rule that says that the purchaser does not get to do that should have an exception for self-replicating technologies. Mr. Walters, can you go back to the Chief Justice's opening question, because the Chief Justice asked you what incentive Monsanto would have to produce this kind of product if you were right. And you said, well, they can protect themselves by contract. Actually, it seems to me that that answer is purely insufficient in this kind of a case, because all that has to happen is that one seed escapes the web of these contracts, and that seed, because it can self-replicate in the way that it can, essentially makes all the contracts worthless. So again, we are back to the Chief Justice's problem, that Monsanto would have no incentive to create a product like this one. I'm sorry. In everything you've said you agree with Mr. Waxman. There is this issue in the case where you disagree, which is the conditional sale doctrine. I am just wondering, before you finish up, could you say a bit about whether that doctrine is causing trouble as it presently exists in the Federal Circuit? In other words, could we just ignore that doctrine if we wanted to, or is it a very problematic one that we should take this opportunity to do something about? Mr. Waxman, there is a worrisome thing on the other side, though, too. And that is the Bureau position has the -- has the capacity to make infringers out of everybody. And that is highlighted actually in this case by how successful this product is and how large a percentage of the market it has had. So that -- you know, seeds can be blown onto a farmer's farm by wind, and all of a sudden you have Roundup seeds there and the farmer is infringing, or there's a 10-year-old who wants to do a science project of creating a soybean plant, and he goes to the supermarket and gets an edamame, and it turns out that it's Roundup seeds. [Laughter] And, you know, these Roundup seeds are everywhere, it seems to me. There's, what, 90 percent of all the seeds that are around? So it seems as though -- like pretty much everybody is an infringer at this point, aren't they? Okay. I'll change my hypothetical. [Laughter] And I thought I was being so clever, too. [Laughter] ",well except to the extent as justice breyer suggest except to the extent that the purchase be go to use the article just to create a new one of the exact same kind and it seem to me that what you be suggest be that the basic rule that say that the purchaser do not get to do that should have an exception for self replicate technology mr walter can you go back to the chief justice s opening question because the chief justice ask you what incentive monsanto would have to produce this kind of product if you we be right and you say well they can protect themselves by contract actually it seem to me that that answer be purely insufficient in this kind of a case because all that have to happen be that one seed escape the web of these contract and that seed because it can self replicate in the way that it can essentially make all the contract worthless so again we be back to the chief justice s problem that monsanto would have no incentive to create a product like this one I be sorry in everything you have say you agree with mr waxman there be this issue in the case where you disagree which be the conditional sale doctrine i be just wondering before you finish up could you say a bit about whether that doctrine be cause trouble as it presently exist in the federal circuit in other word could we just ignore that doctrine if we want to or be it a very problematic one that we should take this opportunity to do something about mr waxman there be a worrisome thing on the other side though too and that be the bureau position have the have the capacity to make infringers out of everybody and that be highlight actually in this case by how successful this product be and how large a percentage of the market it have have so that you know seed can be blow onto a farmer s farm by wind and all of a sudden you have roundup seed there and the farmer be infringe or there be a year old who want to do a science project of create a soybean plant and he go to the supermarket and get an edamame and it turn out that it be roundup seed laughter and you know these roundup seed be everywhere it seem to me there be what percent of all the seed that be around so it seem as though like pretty much everybody be an infringer at this point be not they okay I will change my hypothetical laughter and i think i be be so clever too laughter ,150.09,Roberts Court,"Feb 19, 2013",Vernon Hugh Bowman,"Monsanto Company, et al.",11-796,"Oct 5, 2012","May 13, 2013",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2012,PPL Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Clement-- --Well, Mr. -- I'm sorry, please. Okay. Then let me ask you my question. Do you agree -- I mean, you said we should look to the way this is designed, so let's look to the way that the actual formula is designed. Do you agree that this tax would impose identical tax liability for companies with -- at the same average profits but could impose very different tax liability for companies with the same total profits? That's the way the thing is designed, is it not? Well, that's the question. Is that true of every excess profits tax? Take a -- a hypothetical like this: You have two companies, Company A and Company B, and one company operates over four years and makes a lot of money and one company operates over one year and makes only a quarter of that amount of money. Now, a typical excess profits tax is going to take Company A, which has made a lot of money, and -- and it's going to end up paying four times as much tax as Company B, which has made only a quarter of the amount of money. But under this tax, Company A and Company B pay the exact same thing; isn't that right? One year or four years? In other words, a company that has made four times as much profits under this formula could pay the same tax; isn't that right? Because it was operating four times as long. And because there is that D variable. Assuming the floatation value is the same for both companies. It definitely could. It would have to. And that's because what this is trying to tax is not total profits; this is trying to tax average profits or what may be the better way to say it, if it's taxing profitability and not profits. But -- but the reason why this formula was devised in the way that this formula was devised was specifically to get at the outlier. In other words, it was to get at the company that only operated for a short amount of time, but they wanted that company to pay just as big a tax bill as the company that had operated for a much longer amount of time and had made many more profits. So the end result is that this company that operates for a very short amount of time and makes almost no excess profits pays the exact same tax bill as a company with four times as much excess profits. No, but even companies with the exact same profits and the exact same floatation value can be subject to different taxes, and that's a result of the amount of time. That's a result of the D variable. If you were right-- --Excuse me. If you were right, the D variable wouldn't exist. If this were an excess profits tax, it would have been written without a D variable because they would not have cared whether it was four years or one year or any place in between. If you were right, it would just be a 52 percent tax on annual profits above 1/9th of the floatation value. And it's not that. It's not that. Specifically in order to get at railroad track, which would have paid very little tax under your formula, but instead pays a great amount of tax because they think that railroad track got the same good deal at the beginning as all these other companies did, but so even though they didn't make much very much in the way of excess profits, they were going to tax them just as much. You're not saying that the amicus brief is wrong. The Chief Justice is, of course, right, the amicus brief is the amicus brief and the amicus brief develops this argument, which I think is the right argument. But you're not saying that's wrong. Because they're saying this is not an income for anybody because, in fact, this doesn't tax anybody's income. It taxes annual -- excuse me -- it taxes average profits, not total profits. It taxes profitability as a mechanism to tax value. Well, now I'm totally confused, because this outlier is an outlier not because the tax hasn't worked. It's an out -- it's an outlier that the tax is designed to get at, that this formula was developed with this D variable in order to make sure that outliers, meaning people, companies that operated for only a short amount of time would still pay a significant tax bill. So the whole design of this tax was to get at the outlier. That seems to me to suggest that the predominant character of the tax is not an income tax but is instead a value tax. Mr. Clement, what do you think would -- is the answer -- suppose that the Labour government had come in, not after 4 years but after 2 years, that they looked at those 2 years of profits, they said that's enough for us to know that these companies were grossly undervalued, and they had done this exact same formula, and the result is that they would have ended up with a tax rate of over 100 percent. Would that have been creditable or not? I guess what the hypothetical suggests is that in some respects, the fact that you now -- that you have a tax rate here of between zero and 1 is a bit of a fluke. You know, if they had come in a little bit earlier and done the exact same thing, based on their understanding of how profitable these companies were, which they would have seen after 2 years, you wouldn't have been able to make the same argument. ",mr clement well mr I be sorry please okay then let me ask you my question do you agree i mean you say we should look to the way this be design so let us look to the way that the actual formula be design do you agree that this tax would impose identical tax liability for company with at the same average profit but could impose very different tax liability for company with the same total profit that be the way the thing be design be it not well that be the question be that true of every excess profit tax take a a hypothetical like this you have two company company a and company b and one company operate over four year and make a lot of money and one company operate over one year and make only a quarter of that amount of money now a typical excess profit tax be go to take company a which have make a lot of money and and it be go to end up pay four time as much tax as company b which have make only a quarter of the amount of money but under this tax company a and company b pay the exact same thing be not that right one year or four year in other word a company that have make four time as much profit under this formula could pay the same tax be not that right because it be operate four time as long and because there be that d variable assume the floatation value be the same for both company it definitely could it would have to and that be because what this be try to tax be not total profit this be try to tax average profit or what may be the good way to say it if it be tax profitability and not profit but but the reason why this formula be devise in the way that this formula be devise be specifically to get at the outlier in other word it be to get at the company that only operate for a short amount of time but they want that company to pay just as big a tax bill as the company that have operate for a much longer amount of time and have make many more profit so the end result be that this company that operate for a very short amount of time and make almost no excess profit pay the exact same tax bill as a company with four time as much excess profit no but even company with the exact same profit and the exact same floatation value can be subject to different tax and that be a result of the amount of time that be a result of the d variable if you we be right excuse me if you we be right the d variable would not exist if this we be an excess profit tax it would have be write without a d variable because they would not have care whether it be four year or one year or any place in between if you we be right it would just be a percent tax on annual profit above th of the floatation value and it be not that it be not that specifically in order to get at railroad track which would have pay very little tax under your formula but instead pay a great amount of tax because they think that railroad track get the same good deal at the beginning as all these other company do but so even though they do not make much very much in the way of excess profit they we be go to tax them just as much you be not say that the amicus brief be wrong the chief justice be of course right the amicus brief be the amicus brief and the amicus brief develop this argument which i think be the right argument but you be not say that be wrong because they be say this be not an income for anybody because in fact this do not tax anybody s income it tax annual excuse me it tax average profit not total profit it tax profitability as a mechanism to tax value well now I be totally confused because this outlier be an outlier not because the tax have not work it be an out it be an outlier that the tax be design to get at that this formula be develop with this d variable in order to make sure that outlier mean people company that operate for only a short amount of time would still pay a significant tax bill so the whole design of this tax be to get at the outlier that seem to me to suggest that the predominant character of the tax be not an income tax but be instead a value tax mr clement what do you think would be the answer suppose that the labour government have come in not after year but after year that they look at those year of profit they say that be enough for us to know that these company we be grossly undervalue and they have do this exact same formula and the result be that they would have end up with a tax rate of over percent would that have be creditable or not i guess what the hypothetical suggests be that in some respect the fact that you now that you have a tax rate here of between zero and be a bit of a fluke you know if they have come in a little bit earlier and do the exact same thing base on their understanding of how profitable these company we be which they would have see after year you would not have be able to make the same argument ,310.82,Roberts Court,"Feb 20, 2013",PPL Corporation,Commissioner of Internal Revenue,12-43,"Oct 29, 2012","May 20, 2013",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2012,Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Hansen, could you tell me what you think the incentives are for a company to do what Myriad did? If you assume that it takes a lot of work and takes a lot of investment to identify this gene, but the gene is not changed in composition, and what you just said is that discovering uses for that gene would not be patentable even if those new -- even if those uses are new, what does Myriad get out of this deal? Why shouldn't we worry that Myriad or companies like it will just say, well, you know, we're not going to do this work anymore? I thought you were going to-- --I thought you were going to say something else, Mr. Hansen, and I guess I -- I hoped you were going to say something else, which is that, notwithstanding that you can't get a patent on this gene, that -- that there are still, you know, various things that you could get a patent on that would make this kind of investment worthwhile in the usual case. But if that's the case, I want to know what those things are rather than you're just saying, you know, we're supposed to leave it to scientists who want Nobel Prizes. And I agree that there are those scientists, but there are also, you know, companies that do investments in these kinds of things that you hope won't just shut them down. Mr. Hansen -- Mr. Hansen just said that to do recombinant technology, you have to use the cDNA rather than the native D -- the isolated DNA. Do you disagree with that? General Verrilli, could I understand what you said, because I think it might be a little bit different from Mr. Hansen and I just want to understand your position. You said that a company can't get a -- a patent on the thing, but can get it on the uses. So, if I find this plant, let's say, in the Amazon and I can't get a patent on the thing itself, but can I get a patent when I discover that if you eat this plant it has therapeutic effects? Mr. Castanias, go back to Justice Alito's plant in the Amazon, right, because it takes a lot of ingenuity and a lot of effort to actually find that plant, just as it takes a lot of effort and a lot of ingenuity to figure out where to snip on -- on the genetic material. But are you -- are you saying that you could patent that plant because it takes a lot of effort and a lot of ingenuity to find it? Well, but can you patent the thing itself? Even though you know you have to extract the plant itself-- --from the Amazon forest. I'm not -- I mean, I don't know what manipulation means. I mean, you have to take the plant and uproot it, all right? And carry it away and isolate it. Can you now patent the thing itself? You've now taken it out of the Amazon forest. Can you now patent it? Well, the plant in the forest can't be used for any purpose either. It only has a use when it's taken out -- you know, when it's uprooted and taken out of the forest. But it's still the same thing. And I guess what you haven't gotten me to understand is how this is different than that. It's still the same thing, but now that you've isolated it, it in fact has lots of great uses. Mr. Castanias, could I take you away from the deference point and just ask again about the -- the kind of law that you would have us make. Do you think that the first person who isolated chromosomes could have gotten a patent on that? Yes. Right. But the first-- --I'm sorry, because -- because -- because, like Justice Breyer, I consider uses -- patents on uses in a different category. So I'm just asking, could you patent the isolated chromosome? Yes. Chromosomes are very useful. The first person who found a chromosome and isolated it, I think we can all say that that was a very useful discovery. And the question is, can you then -- can the person who found that chromosome and isolated it from the body, could they have gone to the PTO? And the PTO seems very patent happy, so could, you know, would -- would they have had a good patentability argument? Yes, of course it does. Would -- would -- okay. And that's interesting-- --because then it's not a question about, you know, breaking these covalent bonds or whatever Judge Lourie thought it was about. Right? So, you know, if -- if not DNA, if -- if not the -- the more smaller unit in the chromosome, you know, we could just go up from there and talk about all kinds of parts of the human body, couldn't we? Couldn't we get to, you know, the first person who found a liver? ",mr hansen could you tell me what you think the incentive be for a company to do what myriad do if you assume that it take a lot of work and take a lot of investment to identify this gene but the gene be not change in composition and what you just say be that discover us for that gene would not be patentable even if those new even if those us be new what do myriad get out of this deal why should not we worry that myriad or company like it will just say well you know we be not go to do this work anymore i think you we be go to i think you we be go to say something else mr hansen and i guess i i hop you we be go to say something else which be that notwithstanding that you can not get a patent on this gene that that there be still you know various thing that you could get a patent on that would make this kind of investment worthwhile in the usual case but if that be the case i want to know what those thing be rather than you be just say you know we be suppose to leave it to scientist who want nobel prize and i agree that there be those scientist but there be also you know company that do investment in these kind of thing that you hope will not just shut them down mr hansen mr hansen just say that to do recombinant technology you have to use the cdna rather than the native d the isolated dna do you disagree with that general verrilli could i understand what you say because i think it might be a little bit different from mr hansen and i just want to understand your position you say that a company can not get a a patent on the thing but can get it on the us so if i find this plant let us say in the amazon and i can not get a patent on the thing itself but can i get a patent when i discover that if you eat this plant it have therapeutic effect mr castanias go back to justice alito s plant in the amazon right because it take a lot of ingenuity and a lot of effort to actually find that plant just as it take a lot of effort and a lot of ingenuity to figure out where to snip on on the genetic material but be you be you say that you could patent that plant because it take a lot of effort and a lot of ingenuity to find it well but can you patent the thing itself even though you know you have to extract the plant itself from the amazon forest I be not i mean i do not know what manipulation mean i mean you have to take the plant and uproot it all right and carry it away and isolate it can you now patent the thing itself you have now take it out of the amazon forest can you now patent it well the plant in the forest can not be use for any purpose either it only have a use when it be take out you know when it have uproot and take out of the forest but it be still the same thing and i guess what you have not get me to understand be how this be different than that it be still the same thing but now that you have isolate it it in fact have lot of great us mr castanias could i take you away from the deference point and just ask again about the the kind of law that you would have us make do you think that the first person who isolate chromosome could have get a patent on that yes right but the first I be sorry because because because like justice breyer i consider use patent on us in a different category so I be just ask could you patent the isolated chromosome yes chromosome be very useful the first person who find a chromosome and isolate it i think we can all say that that be a very useful discovery and the question be can you then can the person who find that chromosome and isolate it from the body could they have go to the pto and the pto seem very patent happy so could you know would would they have have a good patentability argument yes of course it do would would okay and that be interest because then it be not a question about you know break these covalent bond or whatever judge lourie think it be about right so you know if if not dna if if not the the more small unit in the chromosome you know we could just go up from there and talk about all kind of part of the human body could not we could not we get to you know the first person who find a liver ,262.42,Roberts Court,"Apr 15, 2013",Association for Molecular Pathology  et al.,Myriad Genetics,12-398,"Nov 30, 2012","Jun 13, 2013",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2012,Tarrant Regional Water District v. Herrmann,114,Elena Kagan,"And what does that mean exactly? What would Oklahoma do to evaluate that application and to compare it to other applications from Oklahomans, and also maybe to compare it -- maybe there is more than one Texas application. How does the Oklahoma board make those decisions? I'm really asking you to tell me what the Oklahoma board is going to do. I mean, why doesn't the Oklahoma board just say, you know, sorry, we like Oklahomans? Would that be all right? What -- what -- what different kind of priorities do they have to use, and why do they have to use them, as I think -- somewhere along the lines of what the Chief Justice was asking? Ms. O'Connell, isn't that a reason why we shouldn't accept your basic view? I mean, if -- if you think of all the issues that you laid out that are going to have to be decided and the difficulty of those issues -- I mean, you read this brief that you submitted, it gives you kind of a headache. That -- that -- you know, and it -- it suggests how difficult the process is. And then you look at this provision, and maybe this provision can be read as an entitlement, but it can just as easily, as -- as Justice Breyer suggested, be read as a cap, “ no more than 25 percent ”. So as between those two possible readings, the complexity of your way of reading this, which would have -- why? And what does that mean? What would Oklahoma do? Well, people keep on saying that, and I -- I guess I just still don't understand quite what it means. I mean, let's say Oklahoma, the board is sitting there and it gets lots of applications from Oklahoma users. And let's say it also gets multiple applications from Texas users. That it's not just one county, it's four counties. What does Oklahoma do to -- to decide who gets the water?

2012,Horne v. Department of Agriculture,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. McConnell, I'm sorry. Could I -- along the lines of what Justice Ginsburg was saying, suppose that the Hornes had given over all the raisins, right, but that they thought that this was improper, that this marketing order was -- it was a violation of the takings clause. Could they have gone to the Court of Claims via the Tucker Act and said, we want our money back? They gave -- they gave over the raisins, they say we're entitled to compensation. Could they have gone through the Court of Claims? In other words, the Hornes did what the marketing order suggested they should do. They gave over the raisins. But they said this is just improper. You're saying they could go to the Court of Claims? Okay. So if -- if that's the case, I guess then the question is, why didn't they have to go that route? Right. That's true-- --I think that's true, Mr. McConnell, as to part of the fine, that part of the fine falls under Apfel, but not the other part. As to the compensation part, it seems to me you have a pretty decent Apfel argument. But as to the penalty part, I don't really understand how the Apfel argument would go. It seems to me that as to the penalty part, the key thing is that if they had handed over the raisins, they could have gone to the Court of Federal Claims and had the compensation done there. And the fact that the Government is penalizing them for not complying with the marketing order does not fall within the rationale of Apfel. Mr. Palmore, before you do that then, haven't you conceded the point that this is not jurisdictional? But Mr. Palmore, if you are conceding now that this is not jurisdictional, it seems to me that your Tucker Act argument as a substantive argument, I mean, has been waived. You didn't raise that argument until the rehearing petition. Well, why is that a necessary part of Apfel? Why didn't Apfel just mean when we are dealing with cash you don't have to go to the Court of Claims? So even if -- you know, you can have a discussion in the district court about whether it's not dollar-for-dollar and it should be discounted in some way. But why should the fact that its dollar-for-dollar mean -- why is that a requirement, as opposed to just it's cash and so the question of, like, you know, handing some -- handing it all over and getting some back, that can be done in the district court rather than making somebody file a separate suit? Mr. Palmore, what would be wrong -- would anything be wrong -- with a -- with a disposition of this Court that went something like this: Everybody agrees that this is not a jurisdictional issue, including the Government, so they got that wrong. Now, as to this whole business about the Tucker Act and whether the Tucker Act provides a remedy, the Government only started talking about that in a petition for rehearing en banc, and the Government can't do that. You know, it can't introduce an argument like this in a petition for rehearing en banc. So that's waived. And now, the Ninth Circuit can go and try to figure out whether this marketing order is a taking or it's just the world's most outdated law. [Laughter] ",mr mcconnell I be sorry could i along the line of what justice ginsburg be say suppose that the horne have give over all the raisin right but that they think that this be improper that this marketing order be it be a violation of the taking clause could they have go to the court of claim via the tucker act and say we want our money back they give they give over the raisin they say we be entitle to compensation could they have go through the court of claim in other word the horne do what the marketing order suggest they should do they give over the raisin but they say this be just improper you be say they could go to the court of claim okay so if if that be the case i guess then the question be why do not they have to go that route right that be true i think that be true mr mcconnell as to part of the fine that part of the fine fall under apfel but not the other part as to the compensation part it seem to me you have a pretty decent apfel argument but as to the penalty part i do not really understand how the apfel argument would go it seem to me that as to the penalty part the key thing be that if they have hand over the raisin they could have go to the court of federal claim and have the compensation do there and the fact that the government be penalize them for not comply with the marketing order do not fall within the rationale of apfel mr palmore before you do that then have not you concede the point that this be not jurisdictional but mr palmore if you be concede now that this be not jurisdictional it seem to me that your tucker act argument as a substantive argument i mean have be waive you do not raise that argument until the rehear petition well why be that a necessary part of apfel why do not apfel just mean when we be deal with cash you do not have to go to the court of claim so even if you know you can have a discussion in the district court about whether it be not dollar for dollar and it should be discount in some way but why should the fact that its dollar for dollar mean why be that a requirement as oppose to just it be cash and so the question of like you know hand some hand it all over and get some back that can be do in the district court rather than make somebody file a separate suit mr palmore what would be wrong would anything be wrong with a with a disposition of this court that go something like this everybody agree that this be not a jurisdictional issue include the government so they get that wrong now as to this whole business about the tucker act and whether the tucker act provide a remedy the government only start talk about that in a petition for rehear en banc and the government can not do that you know it can not introduce an argument like this in a petition for rehear en banc so that be waive and now the ninth circuit can go and try to figure out whether this marketing order be a taking or it be just the world s most outdated law laughter ,183.89,Roberts Court,"Mar 20, 2013","Marvin D.

2012,Sekhar v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Clement-- --Mr. Clement, just along the same lines. What you're saying is that it still would not be extortion -- let's say somebody in your client's position runs an investment company, wants an investment, wants the fees that come along with that investment. Goes to -- let's say that there's a single person who gets to decide whether to make that investment, and so to pay those fees, goes to that person, threatens that person with something terrible happening to him. You're saying that that does not count as extortion, that there's a reason that the Government didn't charge it like that? Well, they want the investment with -- and the fees that come with the investment. So -- and that's why they're threatening the person. Even -- even though they wouldn't have gotten the investment and they wouldn't have gotten the fees absent the -- the threat of force or -- or violence? But if you think the commitment is real cash, is a real contract, real cash, real property, right, then it wouldn't matter under that -- under what you just said, that the threat was made to the general counsel rather than to the final person who issued the money, isn't that right? Right. But you wouldn't say, well, we're dealing with an organization, so it's only extortion if you threaten the person who writes the check? If you threaten the person who makes a recommendation to the person who writes the check, that's good enough. Ms. Harrington, just to go back to Justice Kennedy's -- I mean, suppose -- was there a reason why it wasn't charged in what seems to me to be the simpler way, which is a threat was made in order to get an investment and in order to get fees to put in your pocket and -- and go away with, and that's extortion. So why wasn't it -- why wasn't that the theory of the case? Do you think there's an obstacle to charging a case that way? Mr. Clement seems to think that there's an obstacle, that even though there's property in that case, there's some other problem with charging the case that way. Ms. Harrington, go back to the Scheidler example, because that was a case where we said there was not extortion when there were threats of violence meant to close down an abortion clinic's operations. What you are suggesting is that if those threats of violence had been targeted at the abortion clinic's lawyer in order to get him to tell the clinic to shut down their operations because they were a violation of law, that it would be an entirely different case. Now, how could that be? So -- so you think if -- if they targeted the -- the clinic's lawyer or the -- if the threats were, Don't shut down the clinic; instead, start delivering babies, that that would be extortion, whereas in the real case it wasn't? Well, because there wasn't -- and there's nothing obtained either way. I mean, you are trying to change what the person is doing, but you are not getting anything from it. Well, yes, he would have ended up with something intangible in those hypotheticals. He would have ended up with the mowed lawn. He would have ended up with the thing that the service was providing them. The -- the problem here is that there is no obtaining of anything that the person is getting from your theory. Ms. Harrington, I guess I'm just confused, and this goes back again to Justice Kennedy's initial question, why it wasn't charged in a much simpler way where the property is not a right by a lawyer to do his job, which seems no other person can get, but where the property was the contract, was the -- was the investment and the fees, and the theory was that a threat was used in order to get that investment and fees. And why wasn't -- why isn't that just -- you know, I look at the facts here and I say extortion, but not on your theory, on my theory. And why wasn't that simple theory used? But you don't think that there's any reason why it, in a future case, it couldn't be charged just the way I said it? ",mr clement mr clement just along the same line what you be say be that it still would not be extortion let us say somebody in your client s position run an investment company want an investment want the fee that come along with that investment go to let us say that there be a single person who get to decide whether to make that investment and so to pay those fee go to that person threaten that person with something terrible happen to him you be say that that do not count as extortion that there be a reason that the government do not charge it like that well they want the investment with and the fee that come with the investment so and that be why they be threaten the person even even though they would not have get the investment and they would not have get the fee absent the the threat of force or or violence but if you think the commitment be real cash be a real contract real cash real property right then it would not matter under that under what you just say that the threat be make to the general counsel rather than to the final person who issue the money be not that right right but you would not say well we be deal with an organization so it be only extortion if you threaten the person who write the check if you threaten the person who make a recommendation to the person who write the check that be good enough ms harrington just to go back to justice kennedy s i mean suppose be there a reason why it be not charge in what seem to me to be the simple way which be a threat be make in order to get an investment and in order to get fee to put in your pocket and and go away with and that be extortion so why be not it why be not that the theory of the case do you think there be an obstacle to charge a case that way mr clement seem to think that there be an obstacle that even though there be property in that case there be some other problem with charge the case that way ms harrington go back to the scheidler example because that be a case where we say there be not extortion when there we be threat of violence meant to close down an abortion clinic s operation what you be suggest be that if those threat of violence have be target at the abortion clinic s lawyer in order to get him to tell the clinic to shut down their operation because they we be a violation of law that it would be an entirely different case now how could that be so so you think if if they target the the clinic s lawyer or the if the threat we be do not shut down the clinic instead start deliver baby that that would be extortion whereas in the real case it be not well because there be not and there be nothing obtain either way i mean you be try to change what the person be do but you be not get anything from it well yes he would have end up with something intangible in those hypothetical he would have end up with the mow lawn he would have end up with the thing that the service be provide them the the problem here be that there be no obtaining of anything that the person be get from your theory ms harrington i guess I be just confuse and this go back again to justice kennedy s initial question why it be not charge in a much simpler way where the property be not a right by a lawyer to do his job which seem no other person can get but where the property be the contract be the be the investment and the fee and the theory be that a threat be use in order to get that investment and fee and why be not why be not that just you know i look at the fact here and i say extortion but not on your theory on my theory and why be not that simple theory use but you do not think that there be any reason why it in a future case it could not be charge just the way i say it ,216.54,Roberts Court,"Apr 23, 2013",Giridhar C.

2012,Salinas v. Texas,114,Elena Kagan,"Isn't the -- isn't the point, Mr. Fisher-- --The question is: What is it insufficient for? In Berghuis, it was insufficient for the purpose of cutting off police questions. That's not the case here. The question here is whether it's sufficient or insufficient for the purpose of allowing his statement -- his silence to be used against him at trial. That's an entirely different question, isn't it? I'm sorry. Just to nail that down, because your first three words were “ absent an invocation ”. Are you now adopting the Solicitor General's argument, because your brief goes further? So are you now saying that the crucial thing is the invocation? And so you would agree with the Government that if he had invoked, that the Fifth Amendment right would come into play. But, Mr. Curry, in a case like Berghuis, which is in a custodial setting, if the defendant there had not ever said anything, had gone through the entire interview and really never said a word, so that the police kept asking him questions, but he never said anything, the prosecutors could then not go in and say, look, for 3 hours, we asked him questions and he didn't talk. That would be off limits. And the question is, if that's off limits, why shouldn't this be off limits as well? If there's no invocation necessary there, for some of the reasons that Justice Ginsburg was saying, why should there be an invocation requirement here? Yes. I -- I understand that in your case, there happens to be a kind of selective answering sort of question. But let's say -- let's take that out of the picture, all right? And just say, you know, he just didn't want to answer questions, all right? So then the question is, why would that case be any different from the case that I posited? He -- he didn't invoke, he just didn't answer. Okay. So you're pinning your argument really on the fact that he did a lot of answering. On this -- on this, you know, you can't pick and choose kind of argument. So would it be fair to say that your argument is, look, you can't just like keep talking and talking and talking and -- and at that point, you have to invoke? If -- if you've been doing a lot of talking and then decide you want to stay silent, at that point, you have to invoke. But that's not to say that you have to invoke in every noncustodial encounter. Is that your argument? You took the words out of my mouth. Mr. Curry, Berghuis is different for a different reason. Berghuis is different because the question in Berghuis is what do you have to do to make the police go away. Here, the police were not going away. There was no -- there's no question of that. But the question is what do you have to do in order to bar the prosecutor from introducing your silence at trial. So that's a really different question, isn't it? Exactly. That's why Berghuis is irrelevant here, because Berghuis said at a certain point, you know, you need to invoke in order to stop questioning. But -- but that's not what's at issue here. Ms. Anders? I'm sorry. We don't require invocation at trial, and we don't require invocation in a custodial setting. And you might think, well, custodial, that's very different because, after all, custodial is inherently coercive, but that's the whole point of Miranda warnings, is that once we give Miranda warnings, that coercion is dispelled and the custodial setting essentially becomes like a noncustodial setting. So if we don't require invocation even after Miranda warnings are given in a custodial setting, why should we require invocation here? Yes, because then when-- --you're given the warnings, and then that's gone. What -- what does that mean? Does he just -- how about if he just said, ""You know, I don't really want to answer that question? "" Well, Ms. Anders, suppose, you know, he thinks that the interview is going to be one thing and then it turns out that the interview was something else. He realizes, it dawns on him that the police really do see him as a suspect. And he says to himself, I better stop answering, right? So he says, okay -- he's answered a bunch of questions already, but -- but now he's -- you know, I don't want to answer any more questions. Is that an invocation? Or if he says, I don't want to answer questions about a particular topic; is that an invocation? That doesn't sound like a clear rule. I mean, you know, as -- as between, you know, I don't want to answer those questions on a particular topic, I don't want to answer that question, or just like could we go on to a different question or -- or I don't know. Why is that different? ",be not the be not the point mr fisher the question be what be it insufficient for in berghuis it be insufficient for the purpose of cut off police question that be not the case here the question here be whether it be sufficient or insufficient for the purpose of allow his statement his silence to be use against him at trial that be an entirely different question be not it I be sorry just to nail that down because your first three word we be absent an invocation be you now adopt the solicitor general s argument because your brief go far so be you now say that the crucial thing be the invocation and so you would agree with the government that if he have invoke that the fifth amendment right would come into play but mr curry in a case like berghuis which be in a custodial setting if the defendant there have not ever say anything have go through the entire interview and really never say a word so that the police keep ask him question but he never say anything the prosecutor could then not go in and say look for hour we ask him question and he do not talk that would be off limit and the question be if that be off limit why should not this be off limit as well if there be no invocation necessary there for some of the reason that justice ginsburg be say why should there be an invocation requirement here yes i i understand that in your case there happen to be a kind of selective answer sort of question but let us say let us take that out of the picture all right and just say you know he just do not want to answer question all right so then the question be why would that case be any different from the case that i posit he he do not invoke he just do not answer okay so you be pin your argument really on the fact that he do a lot of answer on this on this you know you can not pick and choose kind of argument so would it be fair to say that your argument be look you can not just like keep talk and talk and talk and and at that point you have to invoke if if you have be do a lot of talk and then decide you want to stay silent at that point you have to invoke but that be not to say that you have to invoke in every noncustodial encounter be that your argument you take the word out of my mouth mr curry berghuis be different for a different reason berghuis be different because the question in berghuis be what do you have to do to make the police go away here the police we be not go away there be no there be no question of that but the question be what do you have to do in order to bar the prosecutor from introduce your silence at trial so that be a really different question be not it exactly that be why berghuis be irrelevant here because berghuis say at a certain point you know you need to invoke in order to stop questioning but but that be not what be at issue here ms anders I be sorry we do not require invocation at trial and we do not require invocation in a custodial setting and you might think well custodial that be very different because after all custodial be inherently coercive but that be the whole point of miranda warning be that once we give miranda warning that coercion be dispel and the custodial setting essentially become like a noncustodial setting so if we do not require invocation even after miranda warning be give in a custodial setting why should we require invocation here yes because then when you be give the warning and then that be go what what do that mean do he just how about if he just say you know i do not really want to answer that question well ms anders suppose you know he think that the interview be go to be one thing and then it turn out that the interview be something else he realize it dawn on him that the police really do see him as a suspect and he say to himself i well stop answering right so he say okay he be answer a bunch of question already but but now he be you know i do not want to answer any more question be that an invocation or if he say i do not want to answer question about a particular topic be that an invocation that do not sound like a clear rule i mean you know as as between you know i do not want to answer those question on a particular topic i do not want to answer that question or just like could we go on to a different question or or i do not know why be that different ,253.29999999999995,Roberts Court,"Apr 17, 2013",Genovevo Salinas,Texas,12-246,"Jan 11, 2013","Jun 17, 2013",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1

How do we know that they would have reach the same determination if they had gotten it right on that single factor? Whether something is-- --Whether something is the State's fault is a significant factor in the analysis, and we have made that very clear in our cases, and so if they got that wrong -- and you, I think quite rightly, are saying we can't defend that part of it -- if they got that wrong don't we at least have to say, okay, well, get it right now and do it again? Ms. Sigler, on appeal you said this, the -- the State said: Because the defendant was without properly funded counsel for so long, the State simply could not ethically or legally bring him to trial. So what did you mean when you said that, that the State could not ethically or legally bring him to trial? Well, did you ever say to Mr. Boyer, you know, you can go ahead right now with this single counsel that you have? Was that ever a choice put to him? Or because -- the way I read all of your assertions below, and indeed the entire record below, is that everybody simply assumed that the case could not go forward in its present circumstances. Well, a decision implies a choice. Was a choice ever put to him? Well, you didn't even know that. You said the State could not ethically or legally bring him to trial. How was he supposed to know that? Ms. Sigler, could you go back to Justice Alito's question? That was a big segue. Do you have it-- --When we said in Brillon, delays resulting from a systemic breakdown in the public defender system could be charged to the State. So that suggests systemic breakdown doesn't necessarily mean deliberate. It just means there has been a breakdown, and the result is that the person can't get to trial. And I think -- if Justice Alito could even read that again, and if you think about it in light of this statement in Brillon, the systemic breakdowns are systemic breakdowns, whether or not they are deliberate. Mr. Boyer -- why would-- --Why would we get to that question? I mean, no courts below have dealt with it. It has been briefed to us in a grand total of two paragraphs, I think. There would be no reason for us to get to that question. So -- so from that point of view, we can assume that there is a robbery conviction that is still out there.

I mean, how much -- how many of the requesters have to be engaged in some kind of commercial activity in order for your arguments to work? But you don't deny that in general, this does affect out-of-State data collectors, people who are engaged in the kind of business that Justice Breyer was talking about. Is that right? Well, general, just indulge me with a hypothetical. Suppose that the backgrounds for these statutes was different. The statutes were the same, but in addition to talking about people's right to know about how their government works, the people spend a lot of time also talking about the economic benefits of a free flow of information in our country. Would that -- if that were true, and I want to put myself on record as not remembering when these statutes were passed-- [Laughter] But if that were true, would this case be different or would you still be up here saying the same thing? The statute does exactly the same thing. I'm just suggesting that there might be two interests behind the statute; one is about knowing the way your government operates and the other is about free flows of information in the economy. And if both of those things had gone into the mix to create the statutes of this kind, would you be up here saying the same thing or not? I think the thing, general, that I was trying to get at, it seems to me you have a very good case that these statutes were meant for a different purpose. But in fact, it seems as though your friends there have a good case that these statutes have been taken over, to a large extent, across the country by economic enterprises doing economic things. And at that point in time, Virginia's -- and, you know, you are only one of two States -- Virginia's maintenance of this kind of -- no, it's Virginians, Virginia information for Virginians, looks very different from what it might have looked like when the statute was originally passed.

2012,Chafin v. Chafin,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Cullen -- Mr. Cullen, it's often true in international litigation that enforcement is very difficult. I mean, take a commercial litigation case where somebody is going after assets and the assets are not in the United States, and somebody looks and says, well, you know, a court can do whatever it wants but nothing is going to happen afterwards. So why is this case any different from, you know, a very frequent problem in international litigation, which is sometimes judgments are difficult to enforce? And if you look at it practically, it may -- may never be enforced, but we don't put courts to the job of saying, oh, well, let's check out the various enforcement options and make predictions about who's going to do what. Well, it's different -- that might be -- it's certainly different in terms of the interests at stake, and that might be a very good reason for Congress to step in and try to fix this system so that you don't have children shuttling back and forth. But, you know, at the risk of sounding hard-hearted, in terms of the law, what is different? Mr. Cullen, may I ask, I'm trying to figure out what exactly your argument is. So let me give you two options, and you tell me what your argument is, all right? One -- you can tell me it's neither, I suppose. But one is this case is moot because there's no practical way to enforce any relief that's ordered by the Eleventh Circuit. All right. That's what I came in thinking your argument was. The second is, is just no, it's just improper for the Eleventh Circuit to enter any order granting relief. So which is it? Is it the it's improper to enter any order at this point, or is it, you know, you can enter an order, but it's just not going to be enforced, and, therefore, this case is moot?

2012,Evans v. Michigan,114,Elena Kagan,"Suppose the question-- --But isn't it -- isn't it hard to argue with a notion that your client has gotten a windfall here? I mean, this is not continuing government oppression and -- and, you know, that's -- that -- that suggests a real harm on the part of your client. I mean, here's a cause of a legal error, your client walks away the winner when he shouldn't have. Yes, I think that's right. This is -- this is an argument against this whole line of cases, that this whole line of cases has essentially set up a system where the real purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause do not apply and where defendants walk away with windfalls. And I guess what's your best argument against that proposition? Mr. Baughman, what would happen if the defendant asked for improper instructions, really saying exactly something like this; you know, that the jury has to find this additional element that in fact it doesn't have to find? But your theory, I would think, would say that too, the government could try the defendant again. After all, the government didn't get its one fair shot. You don't go that far, in other words, just because it doesn't happen to be this case, but do you concede that the logic of your position would extend to improperly instructed juries? Well, we've historically said it in this context, too. I mean, the cases that you are asking us to overrule go back 50 years. But the point I was making was that the same windfall is received by the defendant that gets an acquittal from an improperly instructed jury. But in several of our cases, what the court has done wrong is to make the prosecution prove additional facts in order to prove an element. So the distinction that you're drawing is one between incorrectly making the prosecution prove additional facts and incorrectly saying that the prosecution has to show an additional element. And I guess I just don't understand that distinction. Well, if I understand your test correctly, under your test, Rumsey, Smalis and Smith would all have come out differently.

2012,Maracich v. Spears,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Guerra, I have to admit that given what a mess this statute is, those three words don't quite do it for me. So, the argument against you, right, as using (b)(12) to define (b)(4), is that, look, this is just a list of exceptions to a general prohibition and no one is more general or specific than any other, and all you have to do is fit within one of them. And it doesn't matter whether you don't fit within two of them if you don't fit within one of them. So then the question would be are you covered by (b)(4) or not? If not, are you covered by (b)(12) or not? Mr. Guerra, where do you get that from in (b)(4), this focus on tribunals rather than lawyers? Because the investigation is done by lawyers, right? And that's a critical part of (b)(4), so where does that come from in the statute? But then it includes things that are clearly done by lawyers. Well, that distinction -- I understand that you are deriving some of it from (b)(12), but if I -- just assume with me that (b)(12) has nothing to do with anything, and you were just limited to (b)(4), can you find that distinction in (b)(4)? Mr. Guerra, don't you think -- I mean, I understand the distinction. The lawyer as commercial actor versus lawyer as officer of the court. But, boy, it's hard to get that from the words here. I mean, that seems like the kind of old-time legislative interpretation, where we just figured out the statute that we hoped Congress would have written as opposed to the statute that it did. I mean, tell me where that distinction is in this provision. Mr. Guerra, suppose I am a lawyer and I want to bring a toxic tort case, and I am really -- I am looking for witnesses who have the same kind of symptoms as my client had. And so I put out a letter saying, you know, have you have been exposed and -- and tell me about it so that I can find out if you are a good witness. And, you know, if you have, I would also like to represent you. Would -- would that count? Well, I guess what I was suggesting was that if I was just asking for witnesses, you would have to say that that was included by (b)(4). Is that right? Now, the court -- the lawyer is saying in addition to your help as a witness, if you have the same symptoms, you know, you can join the suit. Can I ask about your line, Mr. Clement? Let me just see if I understand it and I'll give you two things-- --and I think one falls on one side of your line-- --and the other falls on the other, but this is just to clarify where your line is. One is, you know, I'm a lawyer, have you ever been in a car accident lately? If you have, contact me and I would love to represent you. That -- the other is, I'm a lawyer, I think that there's a -- a real -- I'm -- I'm bringing a lawsuit about these red light cameras and saying that they're unlawful and would you like to join me in that litigation. Am I right to think that the first falls on one side of the line, it's not enough, there's no litigation there and the seconds falls on the other side, according to you? But your line-- --is a contemplated litigation. A specific contemplated litigation. But which do you say, Mr. Clement, that you and your varsity version of the -- which is stronger than the other one is-- --is something like if (b)(4) is hard, we have to draw a line someplace, we can look to (b)(12) as expressing some kind of concern that we can use to draw that line. It's not a conflict, we don't have to -- you know, it's not inconsistent, it's just this is an expression of what was Congress was thinking about, we're going to use it as a clue. But, Mr. Guerra, it didn't draw the line at solicitation in (b)(4) and the advantage of Mr. Clement's argument is that the line that he sets up actually has a textual basis in (b)(4). Because it focuses on words like what is a litigation and what is a proceeding and are we there yet. And that seems to be what the language of (b)(4) indicates. ",mr guerra i have to admit that give what a mess this statute be those three word do not quite do it for me so the argument against you right as use b to define b be that look this be just a list of exception to a general prohibition and no one be more general or specific than any other and all you have to do be fit within one of them and it do not matter whether you do not fit within two of them if you do not fit within one of them so then the question would be be you cover by b or not if not be you cover by b or not mr guerra where do you get that from in b this focus on tribunal rather than lawyer because the investigation be do by lawyer right and that be a critical part of b so where do that come from in the statute but then it include thing that be clearly do by lawyer well that distinction i understand that you be derive some of it from b but if i just assume with me that b have nothing to do with anything and you we be just limit to b can you find that distinction in b mr guerra do not you think i mean i understand the distinction the lawyer as commercial actor versus lawyer as officer of the court but boy it be hard to get that from the word here i mean that seem like the kind of old time legislative interpretation where we just figure out the statute that we hop congress would have write as oppose to the statute that it do i mean tell me where that distinction be in this provision mr guerra suppose i be a lawyer and i want to bring a toxic tort case and i be really i be look for witness who have the same kind of symptom as my client have and so i put out a letter say you know have you have be expose and and tell me about it so that i can find out if you be a good witness and you know if you have i would also like to represent you would would that count well i guess what i be suggest be that if i be just ask for witness you would have to say that that be include by b be that right now the court the lawyer be say in addition to your help as a witness if you have the same symptom you know you can join the suit can i ask about your line mr clement let me just see if i understand it and I will give you two thing and i think one fall on one side of your line and the other fall on the other but this be just to clarify where your line be one be you know I be a lawyer have you ever be in a car accident lately if you have contact me and i would love to represent you that the other be I be a lawyer i think that there be a a real I be I be bring a lawsuit about these red light camera and say that they be unlawful and would you like to join me in that litigation be i right to think that the first fall on one side of the line it be not enough there be no litigation there and the second fall on the other side accord to you but your line be a contemplated litigation a specific contemplated litigation but which do you say mr clement that you and your varsity version of the which be strong than the other one be be something like if b be hard we have to draw a line someplace we can look to b as express some kind of concern that we can use to draw that line it be not a conflict we do not have to you know it be not inconsistent it be just this be an expression of what be congress be think about we be go to use it as a clue but mr guerra it do not draw the line at solicitation in b and the advantage of mr clement s argument be that the line that he set up actually have a textual basis in b because it focus on word like what be a litigation and what be a proceeding and be we there yet and that seem to be what the language of b indicates ,236.32,Roberts Court,"Jan 9, 2013","Edward F.

And this goes back to what Justice Breyer said earlier. I don't know of a lawyer who would say the following to himself: I'm not going to make this objection because I'm just going to assume that sometime between now and my direct appeal the law is going to change, and it's going to change in my favor, and when it changes, I'm going to be able to make this objection and get over not only prong two but prong three and four of the test, and life will be grand for my client. Now, who is going to say that? Well, should the Government agree with that really? Should some -- can you imagine -- isn't it just as much of a unicorn for an attorney to say, I'm not going to take great care because I think that the law is going to change between now and the appeal, and because I think I'm going to win on prongs two and three -- three and four.

And so it -- it doesn't affect either the attorney's intentional conduct or his level of preparation and care. Well, the Government had a different argument before. In Johnson, the Government called this distinction an amorphous one. And it says, ""Nothing in the text of Rule 52(b) contemplates or permits any such distinction. "" ""An error is either plain, or it is not. "" ""It is more faithful to the text of 52(b) and simpler for the courts of appeals to obviate that distinction altogether. "" said the Government. This Court did not disagree. This Court took a half step. And the question before us is still the question that was before you when you wrote this passage, you being the Government, which is should we distinguish between the Johnson case and this one. And you very clearly stated, both as to a matter of text and to a matter of what's simpler for the courts of appeals, that there should be no such distinction. Mr. Wall, can -- can I ask you about footnote 4 of your brief? This is the footnote in which you say that this case involves only a claim of sentencing error, and it doesn't involve a claim of actual innocence based on an intervening decision. Is that footnote meant to suggest that you think, or at least that you contemplate the possibility that where there is an intervening decision making clear the conduct that a person had been convicted of was in fact not criminal, that you would think a different rule should apply? That the Johnson rule should apply? Because then that creates yet another complication in this interpretation of Rule 52. And one might say, We just want a uniform rule, that it should all be at one time, and having said which time it should be at in Johnson, and having suggested that it should also be in the time of appeal for actual innocence claims, that it would be strange to carve out this single set of cases involving intervening changes of the law, and say those should be at the time of trial. But -- an honest footnote, an honest footnote in that you're saying there is this other category of cases that's lurking out there, and that category seems as though we should have the Johnson rule. But now we have two tails. But, you know, the one tail is Johnson and one tail is actual innocence, but this is just a tail, too. ",but mr wall your whole argument about judicial efficiency be an incentives argument and it depend upon the notion that a lawyer be go to change their behavior a lawyer be go to make an objection that he otherwise would not have make if the rule that ms gilley propose be accept and this go back to what justice breyer say earlier i do not know of a lawyer who would say the following to himself I be not go to make this objection because I be just go to assume that sometime between now and my direct appeal the law be go to change and it be go to change in my favor and when it change I be go to be able to make this objection and get over not only prong two but prong three and four of the test and life will be grand for my client now who be go to say that well should the government agree with that really should some can you imagine be not it just as much of a unicorn for an attorney to say I be not go to take great care because i think that the law be go to change between now and the appeal and because i think I be go to win on prong two and three three and four i mean nobody can think that those circumstance would arise they be fluke when they arise and so it it do not affect either the attorney s intentional conduct or his level of preparation and care well the government have a different argument before in johnson the government call this distinction an amorphous one and it say nothing in the text of rule b contemplate or permit any such distinction an error be either plain or it be not it be more faithful to the text of b and simpler for the court of appeal to obviate that distinction altogether say the government this court do not disagree this court take a half step and the question before us be still the question that be before you when you write this passage you be the government which be should we distinguish between the johnson case and this one and you very clearly state both as to a matter of text and to a matter of what be simpler for the court of appeal that there should be no such distinction mr wall can can i ask you about footnote of your brief this be the footnote in which you say that this case involve only a claim of sentence error and it do not involve a claim of actual innocence base on an intervening decision be that footnote mean to suggest that you think or at least that you contemplate the possibility that where there be an intervening decision make clear the conduct that a person have be convict of be in fact not criminal that you would think a different rule should apply that the johnson rule should apply because then that create yet another complication in this interpretation of rule and one might say we just want a uniform rule that it should all be at one time and have say which time it should be at in johnson and have suggest that it should also be in the time of appeal for actual innocence claim that it would be strange to carve out this single set of case involve intervene change of the law and say those should be at the time of trial but an honest footnote an honest footnote in that you be say there be this other category of case that be lurk out there and that category seem as though we should have the johnson rule but now we have two tail but you know the one tail be johnson and one tail be actual innocence but this be just a tail too ,208.82,Roberts Court,"Nov 28, 2012",Armarcion D.

2012,Comcast v. Behrend,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Estrada, doesn't Justice Ginsburg's question actually point out that the -- the law that both the district court and the circuit court used in this case was actually quite favorable to you. Unlike some courts, both the district court and the circuit court said that the plaintiffs needed to show that there was a class-wide measurement of damages. And then in addition, both courts said really, it was -- the burden was on the plaintiffs to demonstrate that that class-wide measure of damages existed. Now, I understand that you have problems with the way in which the plaintiffs met that burden. You say that they didn't meet that burden. But it seems to me that the legal standard that was used was exactly the legal standard that you wanted, that the plaintiffs had to come in and show by a preponderance that they had a class-wide way to measure damages in this case. Well, here's what the district court said. ""The experts' opinions raise substantial issues of fact and credibility that we are required to resolve to decide the pending motion. "" That is the motion for class certification. ""Having rigorously analyzed the experts' reports, we conclude that the class has met its burden to demonstrate that the elements of antitrust impact is capable of proof at trial through evidence that is common to the class, and that there is a common methodology available to measure and quantify damages on a class-wide basis. "" So that seems to me exactly what you say they should have done. Now, you disagree with their ultimate determination, but not with the statement of the law. Well, Mr.-- --Mr. Estrada, as -- as the case comes to the Court, I guess I wonder why any of this is relevant. You mentioned earlier, you mentioned earlier that we reformulated the question presented in this case. And we reformulated in a way which said that what we wanted to talk about was whether a district court at a class certification stage has to conduct a Daubert inquiry, in other words has to decide on the admissibility of expert testimony relating to class-wide damages. And, you know, it would not be crazy to surmise that we reformulated the question because we wanted to present, we wanted to decide a legal question, rather than a question about who was right as to this particular expert's report and how strong it was. And it turns out that as to that legal question, your clients waived their -- their argument that this was inadmissible evidence. So -- so what do we do in that circumstance? The district court, Mr. Estrada, clearly understood you to be making an argument about weight and not about admissibility. And indeed the district court in open court -- and -- and it's in the transcript -- suggests that it's doing something different from holding a Daubert hearing, explains how it's different from holding a Daubert hearing, and both lawyers agree to that statement. Mr. Estrada, it seems like a remarkable proposition, honestly, especially with a client like yours that is well lawyered. It seems like a remarkable proposition that somebody -- a party can say, we have objections about the weight of this evidence. We don't think -- we don't think it's a strong expert report, and that -- and that we -- and that the Court should then infer that there is an objection to admissibility of evidence as opposed, again, to the weight and strength of evidence. I mean, surely a district court confronted with an argument about the weight and strength of evidence does not have to say: Oh, I better go hold a Daubert hearing to rule on admissibility even though nobody's asked me-- --to rule on admissibility. Did you ever file a motion to strike the expert report? Mr. Barnett, it's always true, isn't it, that evidence that is inadequately probative is inadmissible? It's always been true, right, if evidence is not-- --If that's the case. I mean, but have we ever said that -- that without an objection somebody can say, look, we -- we argued about this evidence and that should be just good enough, even though we didn't -- we didn't make an objection to exclude it? Mr. Barnett -- I'm sorry. Go ahead. Okay. Then I will. I am still in search of a legal question that anybody disagrees about here. You know, I read before the district court statement of the standard, now all points of the circuit court statement of the standard, where the circuit court says, ""The inquiry for a district court at the class certification stage is whether the plaintiffs have demonstrated. "" --burden is on you -- ""by a preponderance of the evidence that they will be able to measure damages on a class-wide basis using common proof. "" The parties both agree with that statement of the standard. It seems to me that the parties also both agree, and this goes back to Justice Sotomayor's question, that if the Daubert question had not been waived, that if -- if Comcast had objected to the admissibility of this expert report, that indeed, the court would -- should have held a hearing on the admissibility of the expert report. So this is a case where it seems to me that except for the question of how good the expert report is, none of the parties have any adversarial difference as to the appropriate legal standard. And, you know, usually we decide cases based on disagreements about law, and here I can't find one. Is there any? Do you disagree with Mr. Estrada on any statement of the legal standard? ",mr estrada do not justice ginsburg s question actually point out that the the law that both the district court and the circuit court use in this case be actually quite favorable to you unlike some court both the district court and the circuit court say that the plaintiff need to show that there be a class wide measurement of damage and then in addition both court say really it be the burden be on the plaintiff to demonstrate that that class wide measure of damage exist now i understand that you have problem with the way in which the plaintiff meet that burden you say that they do not meet that burden but it seem to me that the legal standard that be use be exactly the legal standard that you want that the plaintiff have to come in and show by a preponderance that they have a class wide way to measure damage in this case well here s what the district court say the expert opinion raise substantial issue of fact and credibility that we be require to resolve to decide the pending motion that be the motion for class certification have rigorously analyze the expert report we conclude that the class have meet its burden to demonstrate that the element of antitrust impact be capable of proof at trial through evidence that be common to the class and that there be a common methodology available to measure and quantify damage on a class wide basis so that seem to me exactly what you say they should have do now you disagree with their ultimate determination but not with the statement of the law well mr mr estrada as as the case come to the court i guess i wonder why any of this be relevant you mention earlier you mention early that we reformulate the question present in this case and we reformulate in a way which say that what we want to talk about be whether a district court at a class certification stage have to conduct a daubert inquiry in other word have to decide on the admissibility of expert testimony relate to class wide damage and you know it would not be crazy to surmise that we reformulate the question because we want to present we want to decide a legal question rather than a question about who be right as to this particular expert s report and how strong it be and it turn out that as to that legal question your client waive their their argument that this be inadmissible evidence so so what do we do in that circumstance the district court mr estrada clearly understood you to be make an argument about weight and not about admissibility and indeed the district court in open court and and it be in the transcript suggest that it be do something different from hold a daubert hearing explain how it be different from hold a daubert hearing and both lawyer agree to that statement mr estrada it seem like a remarkable proposition honestly especially with a client like yours that be well lawyered it seem like a remarkable proposition that somebody a party can say we have objection about the weight of this evidence we do not think we do not think it be a strong expert report and that and that we and that the court should then infer that there be an objection to admissibility of evidence as oppose again to the weight and strength of evidence i mean surely a district court confront with an argument about the weight and strength of evidence do not have to say oh i good go hold a daubert hearing to rule on admissibility even though nobody s ask me to rule on admissibility do you ever file a motion to strike the expert report mr barnett it be always true be not it that evidence that be inadequately probative be inadmissible it be always be true right if evidence be not if that be the case i mean but have we ever say that that without an objection somebody can say look we we argue about this evidence and that should be just good enough even though we do not we do not make an objection to exclude it mr barnett I be sorry go ahead okay then i will i be still in search of a legal question that anybody disagree about here you know i read before the district court statement of the standard now all point of the circuit court statement of the standard where the circuit court say the inquiry for a district court at the class certification stage be whether the plaintiff have demonstrated burden be on you by a preponderance of the evidence that they will be able to measure damage on a class wide basis use common proof the party both agree with that statement of the standard it seem to me that the party also both agree and this go back to justice sotomayor s question that if the daubert question have not be waive that if if comcast have object to the admissibility of this expert report that indeed the court would should have hold a hearing on the admissibility of the expert report so this be a case where it seem to me that except for the question of how good the expert report be none of the party have any adversarial difference as to the appropriate legal standard and you know usually we decide case base on disagreement about law and here i can not find one be there any do you disagree with mr estrada on any statement of the legal standard ,340.16,Roberts Court,"Nov 5, 2012","Comcast Corp., et

What if the Court is just saying, we want to keep unsafe trucks off the road, but we're not prohibiting you for past violations that you've cured. All we're doing is keeping unsafe trucks out of our port. But why does that -- why does it have to be truck by truck rather than operator by operator? Why can't the port say, you know, when we found a couple of trucks that this company uses that are unsafe, we're just going to keep the company off our premises until the company can show us that they've cured all their trucks, that they are a safe operator now. Mr. Bash, what would you think of this case if the criminal penalties were taken out of it? In other words, if the Port did this all through contract, basically said to each terminal operator, look, if you contract with truckers that don't have this concession agreement, we are going to charge you a higher price. So -- so if the criminal penalties were not in the case, is there enough here to still make this the force and effect of law? Mr. Rosenthal, could I interrupt you for a second and just make sure I understand what your policy is? Who do you exclude from the Port? What trucks -- what trucks or what trucking companies do you exclude? And -- and not just the noncompliant trucks, but the entire operator who are having some noncompliant trucks, is that correct?

2012,Smith v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Kramer-- Ms. Harrington-- --So, how do we tell that, Ms. Harrington? Because it seems to me the crux of the difference between you and your friend is that you say the element is membership in the conspiracy at some point, doesn't matter whether it's within the limitations period. And he says the element is membership in a conspiracy in the limitations period. And if he's right, a set of things follow from that; and if you are right, another set of things follow. So how do we determine that the -- you know, that the statute of limitations, that the timing question is not baked into the elements question? That it's just membership sometime as opposed to membership at a particular time? Could I make sure I understand one part of your argument, Ms. Harrington. The conclusion that timing -- the timing is not an element. Now, take Justice Sotomayor's example of something which is not a conspiracy at all, let's say somebody commits a robbery and you have to show that the person has committed a robbery and that the person brings up the question of timing. You also have the burden of -- of persuasion on that. But would the timing be an element in that case or not? And so you are essentially saying that this case should be treated just as every other case. You happen to have the burden of persuasion if somebody says the statute of limitations has been violated, but the question of when conduct occurred is never an element. Why is it then -- I mean, why would Grunewald be right, that you do have the burden if in fact this isn't an element? Well, that's because they thought that you had the burden. And it -- it does strike me that if you are right that this is an element -- membership in the conspiracy at a particular time -- and the government has the burden, this idea that the government could, you know, just sort of just say, ""Well, we don't have any evidence, but we think you should presume that we're right. "" I mean, that's -- the government couldn't do that if you are right. Well, if you make an assertion and they don't really respond to the assertion and -- you win. Well, Mr. Kramer, if they really have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there is membership in the conspiracy during the limitations period, they couldn't just come in and say, ""Well, there's membership in the conspiracy before the limitations period, and, you know, you should assume that it continued. "" I mean that's not a beyond-a-reasonable-doubt kind of proof, is it? ",mr kramer ms harrington so how do we tell that ms harrington because it seem to me the crux of the difference between you and your friend be that you say the element be membership in the conspiracy at some point do not matter whether it be within the limitation period and he say the element be membership in a conspiracy in the limitation period and if he be right a set of thing follow from that and if you be right another set of thing follow so how do we determine that the you know that the statute of limitation that the timing question be not bake into the element question that it be just membership sometime as oppose to membership at a particular time could i make sure i understand one part of your argument ms harrington the conclusion that time the timing be not an element now take justice sotomayor s example of something which be not a conspiracy at all let us say somebody commit a robbery and you have to show that the person have commit a robbery and that the person bring up the question of timing you also have the burden of of persuasion on that but would the timing be an element in that case or not and so you be essentially say that this case should be treat just as every other case you happen to have the burden of persuasion if somebody say the statute of limitation have be violate but the question of when conduct occur be never an element why be it then i mean why would grunewald be right that you do have the burden if in fact this be not an element well that be because they think that you have the burden and it it do strike me that if you be right that this be an element membership in the conspiracy at a particular time and the government have the burden this idea that the government could you know just sort of just say well we do not have any evidence but we think you should presume that we be right i mean that be the government could not do that if you be right well if you make an assertion and they do not really respond to the assertion and you win well mr kramer if they really have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there be membership in the conspiracy during the limitation period they could not just come in and say well there be membership in the conspiracy before the limitation period and you know you should assume that it continued i mean that be not a beyond a reasonable doubt kind of proof be it ,141.98000000000005,Roberts Court,"Nov 6, 2012","Calvin Smith, et al.",United States,11-8976,"Jun 18, 2012","Jan 9, 2013",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1

2012,Missouri v. McNeely,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Koester, suppose that, instead of waiting 2 hours, there were procedures in place in Missouri and, indeed, across the country where it was possible to get a warrant in these circumstances within 15 or 20 minutes. Would you still be saying that there is a sufficient exigency to avoid the warrant requirement? You suggest that 15 or 20 would be a different case. I am wondering where you would draw the bright line. Or maybe they're drunk. But, but, but -- I mean, Justice Scalia raises a point, which is you always have some delay. Unless you are talking about sticking a needle in somebody roadside, you have to take them to the hospital. So there's going to be some amount of time which you're going to lose, and why can't you use that amount of time, if you can, to try to get a warrant? Going back to Justice Scalia's question, if a person does take a breathalyzer, is there ever a reason for a warrantless blood test? All this talk about, you know, losing evidence every second, I mean, I suppose the exact same thing could be said in other alcohol-related crimes, public drunkenness, underage drinking. You wouldn't be making the same arguments there, would you? Or would you? So it's not just exigency that you're -- you're saying that there should be a weighing of the costs and benefits here. That's a separate question, isn't it? I mean, one prong of your argument is you need individualized circumstances, you can't have a per se rule. And now this other set of questions about what you get to count in the totality of the circumstances test; is that right? So one could disagree with you and one could think, as Justice Alito and Justice Kennedy suggested, you know, you do take into account that it's the middle of the night in a rural county and it's going to take two hours, but still think, well, that's the analysis you had to go through. Mr. Shapiro, Schmerber is an odd case, because Justice Ginsburg are exactly right, that they spend a lot of time talking about special facts, and particularly so, but then you read the opinion kind of backwards and forwards, and you can't find the special facts. ",mr koester suppose that instead of wait hour there we be procedure in place in missouri and indeed across the country where it be possible to get a warrant in these circumstance within or minute would you still be say that there be a sufficient exigency to avoid the warrant requirement you suggest that or would be a different case i be wonder where you would draw the bright line or maybe they be drunk but but but i mean justice scalia raise a point which be you always have some delay unless you be talk about stick a needle in somebody roadside you have to take them to the hospital so there be go to be some amount of time which you be go to lose and why can not you use that amount of time if you can to try to get a warrant go back to justice scalia s question if a person do take a breathalyzer be there ever a reason for a warrantless blood test all this talk about you know lose evidence every second i mean i suppose the exact same thing could be say in other alcohol relate crime public drunkenness underage drinking you would not be make the same argument there would you or would you so it be not just exigency that you be you be say that there should be a weighing of the cost and benefit here that be a separate question be not it i mean one prong of your argument be you need individualized circumstance you can not have a per se rule and now this other set of question about what you get to count in the totality of the circumstance test be that right so one could disagree with you and one could think as justice alito and justice kennedy suggest you know you do take into account that it be the middle of the night in a rural county and it be go to take two hour but still think well that be the analysis you have to go through mr shapiro schmerber be an odd case because justice ginsburg be exactly right that they spend a lot of time talk about special fact and particularly so but then you read the opinion kind of backwards and forward and you can not find the special fact ,125.23,Roberts Court,"Jan 9, 2013",Missouri,Tyler G.

2012,US Airways v. McCutchen,114,Elena Kagan,"But, Mr. Katyal, could I ask you about the legal argument that you are making, the distinction you are making between reimbursement agreements and subrogation agreements, which you think -- seem to think is critical here. And, you know, once you put it in one box rather than another, some result follows, different results follow. So -- so how do you know whether you have a reimbursement agreement or a subrogation agreement and what follows from that categorization? So if this were a subrogation agreement, what would follow? So if your friend's argument would get a lot stronger if it were a subrogation agreement, how do we tell that this agreement is a reimbursement agreement rather than -- are we supposed to just take that because that's the way the Court -- it's come to us, or -- or is there an argument about why there is a reimbursement? Mr. Palmore, do you agree with Mr. Katyal's view of this distinction between subjugation -- subrogation agreements and reimbursement agreements and which this agreement is? Well, but I think Mr. Katyal said that if this were a subrogation agreement, Mr. McCutchen would have a much better argument because a different set of rules would apply. And so that makes this categorization question quite meaningful. Now, you could say, well, we don't see it as all that meaningful. We think, no matter what you call this agreement, the same rules apply. Or you could say, yes, different rules apply with respect to these two different kinds of agreements, and your job is to figure out which kind of agreement this is. But doesn't Sereboff suggest not? I mean, I realize that Sereboff has this footnote, but if you read the text in Sereboff, it says ""these affirmative defenses that would arise. "" in a normal subrogation context are beside the point. So how are they not the beside the point? So is that true that in Sereboff there was no agreement? I guess I don't understand that, because it seems to me that when Sereboff said it was beside the point, they were refuting the argument that the insured party was making, that the insured party was saying, hey, look, we have these great defenses. And you are saying they had an agreement but they also said they have these great defenses, and the Court said, too bad, those defenses don't work for you here. Mr. Wessler, would it be fair to say -- I mean, we're in this unusual position because we're supposed to be looking back to before the 1930s sometime. Would it be fair to say that we just don't have very many cases, and Mr. Katyal doesn't have any, and you don't have any, that raise this question that where somebody walks into an equity court with a contract, and we try to figure out whether the equity court is going to use these unjust enrichment defenses? Would it be fair to say that we just don't know? Why didn't it? ",but mr katyal could i ask you about the legal argument that you be make the distinction you be make between reimbursement agreement and subrogation agreement which you think seem to think be critical here and you know once you put it in one box rather than another some result follow different result follow so so how do you know whether you have a reimbursement agreement or a subrogation agreement and what follow from that categorization so if this we be a subrogation agreement what would follow so if your friend s argument would get a lot strong if it we be a subrogation agreement how do we tell that this agreement be a reimbursement agreement rather than be we suppose to just take that because that be the way the court it be come to us or or be there an argument about why there be a reimbursement mr palmore do you agree with mr katyal s view of this distinction between subjugation subrogation agreement and reimbursement agreement and which this agreement be well but i think mr katyal say that if this we be a subrogation agreement mr mccutchen would have a much well argument because a different set of rule would apply and so that make this categorization question quite meaningful now you could say well we do not see it as all that meaningful we think no matter what you call this agreement the same rule apply or you could say yes different rule apply with respect to these two different kind of agreement and your job be to figure out which kind of agreement this be but do not sereboff suggest not i mean i realize that sereboff have this footnote but if you read the text in sereboff it say these affirmative defense that would arise in a normal subrogation context be beside the point so how be they not the beside the point so be that true that in sereboff there be no agreement i guess i do not understand that because it seem to me that when sereboff say it be beside the point they we be refute the argument that the insured party be make that the insured party be say hey look we have these great defense and you be say they have an agreement but they also say they have these great defense and the court say too bad those defense do not work for you here mr wessler would it be fair to say i mean we be in this unusual position because we be suppose to be look back to before the s sometime would it be fair to say that we just do not have very many case and mr katyal do not have any and you do not have any that raise this question that where somebody walk into an equity court with a contract and we try to figure out whether the equity court be go to use these unjust enrichment defense would it be fair to say that we just do not know why do not it ,162.95000000000005,Roberts Court,"Nov 27, 2012","US Airways, Inc. in its capacity as Fiduciary and Plan Administrator of the US Airways Employee Benefit Plan",James E.

2012,Vance v. Ball State University,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Ortiz, suppose I agree with your standard, but I just can't find on the record as it has been presented in this Court any evidence that Davis actually served as Vance's supervisor. What -- I mean, what's your best -- so if that's true, I would be tempted to actually just decide the thing rather than to remand it. So as against that approach, what is your best evidence that there was a supervisory relationship under your standard here? Well, is that the case? Is there evidence that you did not present because the Seventh Circuit applied a different standard? Could I ask you how the Seventh Circuit test works in operation? We're in a university setting here, so let me give you a university hypo. There's a professor, and the professor has a secretary. And the professor subjects that secretary to living hell, complete hostile work environment on the basis of sex, all right? But the professor has absolutely no authority to fire the secretary. What would the Seventh Circuit say about that situation? No, no, the secretary is fired by the head of secretarial services. Professors don't have the ability to fire secretaries; but, professors do have the ability to make secretarial lives living hells. So what does the Seventh Circuit say about that? Under the Seventh Circuit test. Even though, of course, it's actually more difficult for the secretary to complain about the professor than it would be for the secretary to complain about the head of secretarial services. And Mr. Srinivasan, if I can just continue on about this, because I just don't even understand the Seventh Circuit test. Would the Seventh Circuit test also say that -- that that person is not a supervisor even if the professor evaluates the secretary on a yearly basis? Mr. Garre, could I ask you about that? You said before that there is no -- nothing to suggest that she left anything on the table because of the nature of the Seventh Circuit standard. So what's the best place in the record for us to look to decide that question as to whether she at all didn't present or didn't develop evidence because of the nature of the Seventh Circuit standard?

2012,McQuiggin v. Perkins,114,Elena Kagan,"But you're creating a world in which this would function as an exception to a State time limit, but not to the AEDPA time limit. Why does that make any sense? But I thought we said in Missouri v. Holland that AEDPA was -- was enacted against a background rule which stated that normal equitable principles, such as this one, which had been applied everywhere to all procedural bars, that AEDPA suggested that those would -- wouldn't fit -- AEDPA was against a background that those would continue to apply. And why is a Federal statute of limitations any different? Yes, but again, it's Congress that we said in Holland, that it's Congress and AEDPA has -- has -- was drafted against this presumption that normal equitable principles would apply. But again, why would Congress have thought that there would be any difference in -- with respect to a statute of limitations? But that applies to States as well. Mr. Bursch, you suggested earlier some way out of this puzzle about why Congress would have put the actual-innocence exception into the second successive petition provision, and not had one for a first petition-- --But that seems really quite odd to me. I mean, a number of my colleagues have said can we really believe that Congress contemplated this. But, I mean, don't we have evidence that Congress contemplated it, in the second and successive context, a slightly tighter version, wouldn't it be quite odd to say that Congress contemplated an actual-innocence exception when you are on your second petition but barred it when you are on your first? What sense would that be. Well, I guess I'm just not sure I understand that. I mean, they could have added a separate provision. Just saying, there's an actual-innocence exception or there is -- there's not consistent with the way they did it in the second and successive petition. Well, it didn't have to. Why would it have necessarily limited (d)(1)(D)? Well, you just you make the converse clear. All I'm saying is that your interpretation of the statute creates a glaring anomaly that people would be out of court on the first petition and they could turn around on their second petition, which is usually disfavored, and get an actual-innocence exception. ",but you be create a world in which this would function as an exception to a state time limit but not to the aedpa time limit why do that make any sense but i thought we say in missouri v holland that aedpa be be enact against a background rule which state that normal equitable principle such as this one which have be apply everywhere to all procedural bar that aedpa suggest that those would would not fit aedpa be against a background that those would continue to apply and why be a federal statute of limitation any different yes but again it be congress that we say in holland that it have congress and aedpa have have be draft against this presumption that normal equitable principle would apply but again why would congress have think that there would be any difference in with respect to a statute of limitation but that apply to state as well mr bursch you suggest early some way out of this puzzle about why congress would have put the actual innocence exception into the second successive petition provision and not have one for a first petition but that seem really quite odd to me i mean a number of my colleague have say can we really believe that congress contemplate this but i mean do not we have evidence that congress contemplate it in the second and successive context a slightly tight version would not it be quite odd to say that congress contemplate an actual innocence exception when you be on your second petition but bar it when you be on your first what sense would that be well i guess I be just not sure i understand that i mean they could have add a separate provision just say there be an actual innocence exception or there be there be not consistent with the way they do it in the second and successive petition well it do not have to why would it have necessarily limit d d well you just you make the converse clear all I be say be that your interpretation of the statute create a glaring anomaly that people would be out of court on the first petition and they could turn around on their second petition which be usually disfavor and get an actual innocence exception ,124.59,Roberts Court,"Feb 25, 2013","Greg McQuiggin, Warden",Floyd Perkins,12-126,"Oct 29, 2012","May 28, 2013",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2012,Florida v. Jardines,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, that's not what the record says, Mr. Garre. I mean, the record suggests that he put the dog on a very long leash, the dog goes back and forth, tries to figure out where the smell is coming from. It's not just -- you know, my first thought was you go up to the door, the dog barks once, and that's it. But you read the record, this dog is there for some extended period of time, going back and forth and back and forth, trying to figure out where the greatest concentration of the smell is. It actually seemed, from my reading of the record, to be, you know, a lengthy and obtrusive process. Mr. Garre, this is what we said in Kyllo. And I'm just going to read it. We said, ""We think that obtaining by sense-enhancing technology any information regarding the interior of the home that could not otherwise have been obtained without physical intrusion into a constitutionally protected area constitutes a search, at least where, as here, the technology in question is not in general public use. "" So what part of that do you think separates your case from this one? In other words, what part of that language does not apply in this case? So does that mean that if we invented some kind of little machine called a, you know, smell-o-matic and the police officer had this smell-o-matic machine, and it alerted to the exact same things that a dog alerts to, it alerted to a set of drugs, meth and marijuana and whatever else, the police officer could not come to the front door and use that machine? So your basic distinction is the difference between like a machine and Franky. That we should not understand Franky as kind of a sense-enhancing law enforcement technology, but we should think of him as just like a guy. How does what you're saying, Ms. Saharsky, square with Karo? Because in Karo, the only thing that the beeper alerted to in the home was the can of ether, which was clearly an item that was being used for drug manufacture. And there was nothing else other than that item, which you might not call it contraband, but it was evidence of illegality, this can of ether. There was no thought that it was used for anything else. And that was the only thing that the beeper alerted it to; and, yet, nonetheless, we said, you know, of course that's a search. Well, not lawful uses in somebody's house. I mean, maybe lawful uses in a factory or in an operating room, but nobody has cans of ether in their house unless they're making drugs. But in Kyllo -- and I think this was what Justice Kennedy was saying. In Kyllo, there was already a seizure that had happened, and the Court just said, this is no -- this is really no greater an intrusion. Okay. So that's clearly -- you do concede if the police officer walks up to the door, smells it himself, no problem there; is that right? But smells it himself, so there's no problem there. So the difference is the dog. So what difference does the dog make? Suppose the dog were not doing this ten-minute bracketing that Justice Breyer was talking about. Suppose this really were a very simple procedure. The dog comes up, takes a sniff, barks, sits down. And, you know, to make it even more, the dog is not a scary-looking dog, the dog is a Cockapoo. So just like, you know, your neighbor with his Cockapoo walks up to your door all the time, that's what this police officer has done. Why do you win that? The dog does what your neighbor's dog does. --that if they select somebody with a sense of smell because they have gotten a tip of drugs in a house, that we give up, in that situation, the assumption that they went to investigate. But I think, Mr. Garre, that the-- --I think, Mr. Garre, that you have to concede that this is a case about police use -- call it a technology, call it whatever you want to call it -- of something that enhances what normal people can sense. And then the question becomes, do you have a reasonable expectation of privacy in, basically, people just having their normal senses, rather than some technique or method or technology that enhances those senses? So that your implied consent or expectations about your neighbor might differ fundamentally, you know, if the neighbor comes and knocks on your door, or if the neighbor brings his magnifying glass and his microscope and everything else and starts testing everything around it. You might say, no, that's -- I'm -- I'm not there for that. ",well that be not what the record say mr garre i mean the record suggest that he put the dog on a very long leash the dog go back and forth try to figure out where the smell be come from it be not just you know my first thought be you go up to the door the dog bark once and that be it but you read the record this dog be there for some extended period of time go back and forth and back and forth try to figure out where the great concentration of the smell be it actually seem from my reading of the record to be you know a lengthy and obtrusive process mr garre this be what we say in kyllo and I be just go to read it we say we think that obtain by sense enhance technology any information regard the interior of the home that could not otherwise have be obtain without physical intrusion into a constitutionally protected area constitute a search at least where as here the technology in question be not in general public use so what part of that do you think separate your case from this one in other word what part of that language do not apply in this case so do that mean that if we invent some kind of little machine call a you know smell o matic and the police officer have this smell o matic machine and it alert to the exact same thing that a dog alert to it alert to a set of drug meth and marijuana and whatever else the police officer could not come to the front door and use that machine so your basic distinction be the difference between like a machine and franky that we should not understand franky as kind of a sense enhance law enforcement technology but we should think of him as just like a guy how do what you be say ms saharsky square with karo because in karo the only thing that the beeper alert to in the home be the can of ether which be clearly an item that be be use for drug manufacture and there be nothing else other than that item which you might not call it contraband but it be evidence of illegality this can of ether there be no thought that it be use for anything else and that be the only thing that the beeper alert it to and yet nonetheless we say you know of course that be a search well not lawful us in somebody s house i mean maybe lawful us in a factory or in an operating room but nobody have can of ether in their house unless they be make drug but in kyllo and i think this be what justice kennedy be say in kyllo there be already a seizure that have happen and the court just say this be no this be really no great an intrusion okay so that be clearly you do concede if the police officer walk up to the door smell it himself no problem there be that right but smell it himself so there be no problem there so the difference be the dog so what difference do the dog make suppose the dog we be not do this ten minute bracketing that justice breyer be talk about suppose this really we be a very simple procedure the dog come up take a sniff bark sit down and you know to make it even more the dog be not a scary look dog the dog be a cockapoo so just like you know your neighbor with his cockapoo walk up to your door all the time that be what this police officer have do why do you win that the dog do what your neighbor s dog do that if they select somebody with a sense of smell because they have get a tip of drug in a house that we give up in that situation the assumption that they go to investigate but i think mr garre that the i think mr garre that you have to concede that this be a case about police use call it a technology call it whatever you want to call it of something that enhance what normal people can sense and then the question become do you have a reasonable expectation of privacy in basically people just have their normal sens rather than some technique or method or technology that enhance those sens so that your implied consent or expectation about your neighbor might differ fundamentally you know if the neighbor come and knock on your door or if the neighbor bring his magnifying glass and his microscope and everything else and start test everything around it you might say no that be I be I be not there for that ,252.57,Roberts Court,"Oct 31, 2012",State of Florida,Joelis Jardines,11-564,"Jan 6, 2012","Mar 26, 2013",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2012,Millbrook v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"What are the kinds of things, Mr. Yang, that would be within the scope of employment, but would not be acting within a law enforcement capacity for a law enforcement officer? What's the difference between those two standards for a law enforcement officer? But you can't give me just a couple of examples of how the difference would matter, you know, in some States, where something would be -- would meet the scope of employment test, but not meet the acting as a law enforcement officer test, for a law enforcement officer again. Mr. Bucholtz, the statute itself has a kind of conduct-based limitation in it. It says law enforcement officers acting within the scope of their employment. So I guess my question is, given that there is that conduct-based limitation in the statute, why one would substitute for it law enforcement officers acting as law enforcement officers? Why wouldn't one use just the conduct-based limitation that's already there? But again, it's not just any acts of law enforcement officers. It's acts of law enforcement officers acting within the scope of their authority. And now you're saying acting as a law enforcement officer. I mean, one question I suppose I have, which is the same question that I gave to Mr. Yang, is what's the difference between those two things? And I guess the second question is: Why would we substitute one phrase about how they have to be acting for the phrase that Congress actually used? Mr. Bucholtz, I'm sure you have done this already, so I apologize, but could you just state your definition of what it means to be acting as a law enforcement officer? What activities other than the three listed get included? But you don't have your own -- so what else gets in the mix? How would you define it generally? Maybe? I mean, yes or no or when or-- --But if we're going to adopt your definition, we have to have some understanding of where it's taking us.

2012,Wos v. E.M.A. et al.,114,Elena Kagan,"General, how do you come up with 33? Why 33? Why not 10 or 60 or 90? Why -- how did you come up with the number? I'm sorry. General, you were -- you were telling me a little bit about the history of this statute. But why 30? Is there any indication of why the State picked 30? If that's where it comes from, then it does relate to a kind of estimate, doesn't it? General, on your theory am I correct that the North Carolina legislature could amend this statute tomorrow to make it two-thirds? But that's what I mean. I mean, on your theory it seems not to matter whether this statute says one-third or two-thirds. And I'm asking whether that's correct. I guess I'm not sure I got that. In other words, I'm assuming an amendment that just all it does is it changes one-third to two-thirds. And so your theory it seems to me would work the exact same way. Then you say: Well, you need a rational basis for doing that. But I thought you told me that the one-third really doesn't have anything to do with an estimate of how much is medical and how much is not medical. So it seems that you would have the same basis to say two-thirds as you do to say one-third. Am I wrong about that? But you're saying there's a kind of side constraint, that Medicaid recipients have to be treated like others, but then presumably, the State could change everybody's? Mr. Browning, let me give you a different rationale for this statute. It's different than the one the State suggests, but it would go something like this: There is an allocation that has to be made. In making allocations there are two ways of doing it. We can do it case-by-case, individualized decisionmaking; or we can use some bright-line rules. And the advantage of bright-line rules is that they are cheap and efficient and sometimes they are not more inaccurate than individualized decisionmaking, because in individualized decisionmaking you can maker errors, too. So this is a reasonable way to make an allocation decision. And nothing that we said in Ahlborn suggests that a State needs to use case-by case decisionmaking rather than bright-line rules to make the allocation that it needs to make between medical and nonmedical damages. What about that? And in those rebuttal presumption States, can both sides come in and try to rebut it? So the individual beneficiary can try to rebut it, but the States could as well? Or is it just a right for the beneficiary to try to rebut the presumption? Well, General, how about this, and I am having a little bit of trouble here because I think a State could come in, or I think there is a reasonable argument that a State could come in and say, you know, we've made an estimate, and here's our best estimate, and we don't think there is a need for an individualized decisionmaking on top of that. But as I understand your argument, that is not what you are saying. You are making a very different kind of argument, suggesting that you can take this number any place, no matter what the relationship between the number and the actual allocation that cases -- that allocation of medical and nonmedical damages in the real world. So if that's the case, what do I do? ",general how do you come up with why why not or or why how do you come up with the number I be sorry general you we be you we be tell me a little bit about the history of this statute but why be there any indication of why the state pick if that be where it come from then it do relate to a kind of estimate do not it general on your theory be i correct that the north carolina legislature could amend this statute tomorrow to make it two third but that be what i mean i mean on your theory it seem not to matter whether this statute say one third or two third and I be ask whether that be correct i guess I be not sure i get that in other word I be assume an amendment that just all it do be it change one third to two third and so your theory it seem to me would work the exact same way then you say well you need a rational basis for do that but i thought you tell me that the one third really do not have anything to do with an estimate of how much be medical and how much be not medical so it seem that you would have the same basis to say two third as you do to say one third be i wrong about that but you be say there be a kind of side constraint that medicaid recipient have to be treat like others but then presumably the state could change everybody s mr browning let me give you a different rationale for this statute it be different than the one the state suggest but it would go something like this there be an allocation that have to be make in make allocation there be two way of do it we can do it case by case individualized decisionmaking or we can use some bright line rule and the advantage of bright line rule be that they be cheap and efficient and sometimes they be not more inaccurate than individualized decisionmaking because in individualized decisionmaking you can maker error too so this be a reasonable way to make an allocation decision and nothing that we say in ahlborn suggests that a state need to use case by case decisionmaking rather than bright line rule to make the allocation that it need to make between medical and nonmedical damage what about that and in those rebuttal presumption state can both side come in and try to rebut it so the individual beneficiary can try to rebut it but the state could as well or be it just a right for the beneficiary to try to rebut the presumption well general how about this and i be have a little bit of trouble here because i think a state could come in or i think there be a reasonable argument that a state could come in and say you know we have make an estimate and here s our best estimate and we do not think there be a need for an individualized decisionmaking on top of that but as i understand your argument that be not what you be say you be make a very different kind of argument suggest that you can take this number any place no matter what the relationship between the number and the actual allocation that case that allocation of medical and nonmedical damage in the real world so if that be the case what do i do ,190.7,Roberts Court,"Jan 8, 2013","Aldona Wos, Secretary, North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services","E.

2012,Ryan v. Gonzales,114,Elena Kagan,"But, Ms. O'Connell, where does that outer limit come from? You suggested looking to that statute as an analogy, but there would be no outer limit in application of that statute, would there? Ms. Marquez, could you tell me, if it were the case that somebody was limited to the state court record, what's your best example of a case in which, nonetheless, a stay would be appropriate; in which, nonetheless, consultation with the client was necessary for a full and fair adjudication? Because I have been trying to think of examples, and, you know, I'm not doing very well, quite honestly. So what's your best one? General, could I ask you, you have been arguing on two different axes. One is how tight the standard should be to grant any stay at all, and the other is what limits there should be on how long a stay can be if a stay is warranted. And I'm just curious, if I forced you to prioritize in terms of the state's interests in effective habeas adjudication, which is more important, you know, cranking up the standard, or making sure that there is a time limit in place? But ordered in that way, that, for you, the time limit is the more important? Yes, I know. But, really, I said, if I forced you to prioritize between the two. What situations would they be appropriate in? Ms. Schimmer, if you are right that no stay was appropriate in these circumstances, we would never reach the question of how much of a stay is appropriate in other circumstances. Isn't that right? I'm saying the exact opposite. In other words, if there was one bright line which says that stays are not appropriate in a record-based claim because there's really nothing that the client can contribute, then we'd have no need or cause to reach the second question of what happens, in a case where a stay might be appropriate, how long that stay should be. Well, Ms. Schimmer, why would that be? I mean, assume a case where you say a stay would be appropriate. So it's not a closed record case; it's a case where the client might be expected to provide information that's -- let's assume it's necessary to a full and fair adjudication of the habeas claim. Why would you cut it off at a year? Why wouldn't it be still true in 2 years, that a full and fair adjudication couldn't take place in those circumstances? Well, it's not an indefinite stay. I think the judge would do what the Chief Justice suggested, that, you know, it's not for ever and ever. We're just going to come back to it periodically. But if the answer is the same, which is that the client's participation is necessary for a full and fair adjudication, then the Court's answer should be the same, too. Why isn't that right? ",but ms oconnell where do that out limit come from you suggest look to that statute as an analogy but there would be no out limit in application of that statute would there ms marquez could you tell me if it we be the case that somebody be limit to the state court record what be your best example of a case in which nonetheless a stay would be appropriate in which nonetheless consultation with the client be necessary for a full and fair adjudication because i have be try to think of example and you know I be not do very well quite honestly so what be your best one general could i ask you you have be argue on two different ax one be how tight the standard should be to grant any stay at all and the other be what limit there should be on how long a stay can be if a stay be warrant and I be just curious if i force you to prioritize in term of the state s interest in effective habeas adjudication which be more important you know crank up the standard or make sure that there be a time limit in place but order in that way that for you the time limit be the more important yes i know but really i say if i force you to prioritize between the two what situation would they be appropriate in ms schimmer if you be right that no stay be appropriate in these circumstance we would never reach the question of how much of a stay be appropriate in other circumstance be not that right I be say the exact opposite in other word if there be one bright line which say that stay be not appropriate in a record base claim because there be really nothing that the client can contribute then we would have no need or because to reach the second question of what happen in a case where a stay might be appropriate how long that stay should be well ms schimmer why would that be i mean assume a case where you say a stay would be appropriate so it be not a closed record case it be a case where the client might be expect to provide information that be let us assume it be necessary to a full and fair adjudication of the habeas claim why would you cut it off at a year why would not it be still true in year that a full and fair adjudication could not take place in those circumstance well it be not an indefinite stay i think the judge would do what the chief justice suggest that you know it be not for ever and ever we be just go to come back to it periodically but if the answer be the same which be that the client s participation be necessary for a full and fair adjudication then the court s answer should be the same too why be not that right ,159.68,Roberts Court,"Oct 9, 2012","Charles L.

2012,Bullock v. BankChampaign,114,Elena Kagan,"But I guess the question is how do you measure this loss? I mean, if you take money away and then you give it back, or even if you give it back with 2 percent interest or something, I mean, maybe if that money had remained in the trust -- and I realize that this is a strange trust, but -- but we have to think about other kinds of trusts -- if that money had remained in the trust, there would have been a profit to be made from that money. And, you know, it's not -- if you say, well, I gave it back, well, yes, but if you had just left it there, you would have had that money plus all the money that that money earned. Mr. Bensinger, if I heard you correctly, you said that the definition was a monetary deficiency arising from a breach of trust. Is that -- does that mean that you're conceding that there has to be a loss of monetary deficiency? Whether there was or was not in this case, but you're conceding that there has to be a monetary deficiency according to the traditional definitions. Well, monetary deficiency, again, isn't that a loss? But I thought that your position was that there didn't need to be a loss. Well, that's certainly true-- --in an ordinary trust, but isn't there a real question as to this trust, because if this trust would -- the trustee shouldn't have been investing this in the first place.

2012,Koontz v. St. John's River Water Management,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Beard, can I go back to Justice Ginsburg's first question and make sure I understand your answer to it? Suppose that the State just had a policy that said, we're concerned about wetlands; in order to develop your piece of property, you have to come forward with a proposal, a mitigation proposal, and an adequate mitigation proposal. And then it gives some guidance about what an adequate mitigation proposal would mean, but it really leaves it up to the landowner. And the landowner says, sorry, I'm not giving you anything. I think I should be able to develop this on my own without providing any mitigation. And the State says, well, then, sorry, you don't get a permit. Is that a taking? Does the man have a takings claim? I heard you answer the question yes. Well, that's the next question I was going to ask you, because my understanding of Nollan and Dolan was that it assumed the conditions, if taken alone, would constitute a taking. Do you disagree with that? Okay. So then you need a taking someplace in the picture. Isn't that right? Nollan-Dolan said this is how we analyze takings in the context of a permit scheme. So we have to look for a taking. So in my example, where is the taking? This was Justice Ginsburg's example. Mr. -- Mr. Beard, I don't think anybody is contesting that there was a condition imposed or maybe there are. But -- you know, there's another question whether that position is a taking. And we've been trying to figure out what's the taking here. In Nollan and Dolan, they took an easement, they took a piece of land. So that's the taking. Now, you said the funds are the taking; is that correct? Any time that somebody comes up with a proposal for -- for a developer to pay money in order to compensate the State for the costs that are associated with his development, that that is itself a taking? No, I understand. But in the permit context, a State can't say to somebody, You have to pay to perform some service or to compensate without it being a taking and without it being subject to Nollan and Dolan analysis. So -- so, for example, and I'll try to do this very quickly, if -- if the State just had a policy for every acre of wetlands you fill in, it costs us $10,000, you need to pay $10,000, that's subject to Nollan and Dolan analysis, too.

2012,"Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",114,Elena Kagan,"So, Mr. Rosenkranz, is what -- is your theory of this statute essentially that this language means nonpiratical copies as that is defined by U.S. copyright law? No. I said as defined by U.S. copyright law. So that's, that's what the statute means. It's -- the statute in your view is setting up a distinction between piratical, pirated, whatever the term is -- copies-- --and other copies, and saying that that distinction should be measured by U.S. copyright law? But a motivation for 109, or a motivation for 602? So on 602, you said that one of the things that they wanted was the segmentation of markets. They got half of it. They got the rogue distributors' half. And I guess Mr. Olson makes the point, and it seems a good one, it's like that's a crazy half to have gotten. That's the kind that they don't need because they have a contractual remedy about -- against the distributors. And then they don't get people like, frankly, your client, who are rogue something elses, with no contractual privity. And what sense does that make? Mr. Rosenkranz, there is that passage in Quality King, which is, I think it's fair to say, unfortunate to your position. Is your basic view of that passage that it was simply ill-considered dicta that we should ignore? Well, in result, but not in reasoning. The passage specifically says this was presumably not to be lawfully made under this title. Mr. Rosenkranz, can I take you back to Justice Ginsburg's opening question? Just as a matter of copyright theory, I had always understood copyright to -- a copyright holder has a kind of a bundle of rights. It's not one right that applies everywhere in the world. It's you have your U.S. rights and you have your Chinese rights, you have your rights under each jurisdiction's law. And your position is essentially to say that when I sell my Chinese rights to somebody, I'm also selling my U.S. rights to that same person, because the person who has the Chinese rights can just turn around and import the goods. I mean, that's the nature of your position, isn't it, that your U.S. rights are always attached when you sell more -- your rights under the jurisdiction of another country? It wasn't necessary, was it? Well, Mr. Olson, can I just take you to-- --Please. Can I take you back to the words here, lawfully made under this title, which you say clearly means what you say it means. So, I find this language a little bit perplexing, and I can kind of see it both ways. So what you say is made under this title, that must mean made in the United States, and lawfully, just as this little word that's -- that modifies that basic phrase, made under this title, which means made in the United States. But what Mr. Rosenkranz essentially says -- he doesn't say it in these words, but he says, ""The focus of this provision is on “ lawfully made ”. "" That is what the focus is on. It's on lawfully made as opposed to unlawfully made. Now, when we just say lawfully made, you know, we need something to measure, well, how do we know whether it's lawfully made? Well, you look to the rules in the copyright law. So if you just -- if you focus more on the lawfully word, lawfully made, and then under this title doesn't mean made in the United States, it means lawfully made under the rules of this title. Well, lawfully made, under the rules of the United States, regardless where the thing was manufactured, is what I'm saying. That's the way -- it just seems to me as though-- --you are saying made must be manufactured. But lawfully made is a lawfully made copy. How do we know if it's lawfully made? We look to this title. Well, intending where? I mean, I -- you spend a lot of time talking about the legislative history and the purposes behind 602. But the language that we're supposed to be interpreting is the language in section 109. And the language in section 109, as far as I can see, there's really nothing to support your argument that that language was intended to address this gray market problem. Isn't that correct? But you know, section 109 is just a rewording of a prior provision that you would clearly lose under, where the prior wording had nothing to do with where any product was manufactured. And what you're suggesting is that we should read this change in wording -- which actually, there's a real theory behind what the change in wording meant that has nothing to do with the place of manufacture, that we should read it as incorporating a place of manufacture requirement, because there was a separate debate going on in section 602 about that question. So Mr. Stewart, if I understand your argument, both here and in Quality King you want the copyright holder to have some control over importation, but at the same time you don't want the copyright holder to have control over all downstream sales. And that's what your Bobbs-Merrill argument is designed to do. It's designed to prevent that. Coming back to Justice Ginsburg's question, do you think that truly the way to do those two things, to give the copyright holder control over importation but not over downstream sales, that our problem really is, do you think in your heart of hearts that we got it wrong in Quality King? So you are essentially saying that the appropriate way to read this statute, to make sense of all of its provisions, is to give the copyright holder control over the importation, to give Wiley the ability to go after this importer, Mr. Kirtsaeng, but to find a way to stop it there. ",so mr rosenkranz be what be your theory of this statute essentially that this language mean nonpiratical copy as that be define by us copyright law no i say as define by us copyright law so that be that be what the statute mean it be the statute in your view be set up a distinction between piratical pirate whatever the term be copy and other copy and say that that distinction should be measure by us copyright law but a motivation for or a motivation for so on you say that one of the thing that they want be the segmentation of market they get half of it they get the rogue distributor half and i guess mr olson make the point and it seem a good one it be like that be a crazy half to have get that be the kind that they do not need because they have a contractual remedy about against the distributor and then they do not get people like frankly your client who be rogue something el with no contractual privity and what sense do that make mr rosenkranz there be that passage in quality king which be i think it be fair to say unfortunate to your position be your basic view of that passage that it be simply ill consider dictum that we should ignore well in result but not in reason the passage specifically say this be presumably not to be lawfully make under this title mr rosenkranz can i take you back to justice ginsburg s open question just as a matter of copyright theory i have always understood copyright to a copyright holder have a kind of a bundle of right it be not one right that apply everywhere in the world it be you have your us right and you have your chinese right you have your right under each jurisdiction s law and your position be essentially to say that when i sell my chinese right to somebody I be also sell my us right to that same person because the person who have the chinese right can just turn around and import the good i mean that be the nature of your position be not it that your us right be always attach when you sell more your right under the jurisdiction of another country it be not necessary be it well mr olson can i just take you to please can i take you back to the word here lawfully make under this title which you say clearly mean what you say it mean so i find this language a little bit perplexing and i can kind of see it both way so what you say be make under this title that must mean make in the united state and lawfully just as this little word that be that modifies that basic phrase make under this title which mean make in the united state but what mr rosenkranz essentially say he do not say it in these word but he say the focus of this provision be on lawfully make that be what the focus be on it be on lawfully make as opposed to unlawfully make now when we just say lawfully make you know we need something to measure well how do we know whether it be lawfully make well you look to the rule in the copyright law so if you just if you focus more on the lawfully word lawfully make and then under this title do not mean make in the united state it mean lawfully make under the rule of this title well lawfully make under the rule of the united state regardless where the thing be manufacture be what I be say that be the way it just seem to me as though you be say make must be manufacture but lawfully make be a lawfully make copy how do we know if it be lawfully make we look to this title well intend where i mean i you spend a lot of time talk about the legislative history and the purpose behind but the language that we be suppose to be interpret be the language in section and the language in section as far as i can see there be really nothing to support your argument that that language be intend to address this gray market problem be not that correct but you know section be just a rewording of a prior provision that you would clearly lose under where the prior wording have nothing to do with where any product be manufacture and what you be suggest be that we should read this change in word which actually there be a real theory behind what the change in word meant that have nothing to do with the place of manufacture that we should read it as incorporate a place of manufacture requirement because there be a separate debate go on in section about that question so mr stewart if i understand your argument both here and in quality king you want the copyright holder to have some control over importation but at the same time you do not want the copyright holder to have control over all downstream sale and that be what your bobbs merrill argument be design to do it be design to prevent that come back to justice ginsburg s question do you think that truly the way to do those two thing to give the copyright holder control over importation but not over downstream sale that our problem really be do you think in your heart of heart that we get it wrong in quality king so you be essentially say that the appropriate way to read this statute to make sense of all of its provision

2012,Genesis Healthcare v. Symczyk,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, it seems as though it's more than housekeeping issue that's involved here because -- I mean, I realize that you have an argument about what happens when the plaintiff's individual claims have been fully satisfied, but the plaintiff continues to want to represent other individuals. But, here, the plaintiff's individual claims have not been fully satisfied. She walked away with nothing. She walked away with no judgment, and she walked away with no $7,500. And the question is: How can it possibly be that her individual claim was moot? Here is what the Court said last in Knox last year, when it said: “ What makes a case moot ”? It says: ""A case becomes moot when it's impossible for a court to grant any effectual relief whatever to the prevailing party. "" Now, here the judge says: Okay, is this case moot? Well, it's not moot because I could give -- at the very least, I could give the plaintiff $7500; but, I didn't give the plaintiff $7500, so she still has her claim for at least $7500, regardless of the collective side of this action. I mean, she hasn't been satisfied. This makes no sense to me because if the offer is for judgment, it has to be proof of validity and amount, because at least you have -- you should be able to get a judgment. But didn't you just tell me that an offer results in an admission of liability and a judgment for a particular amount? But, Mr. Mann-- What do you think the court should do in that circumstance, where a defendant comes forward and says, I'm willing to satisfy the entire claim? What should happen? Is this under Rule 68 or is this under some inherent authority? Mr. Katyal, if we do get to the question that Mr. Mann wants us to raise, you spend a lot of time talking about McLaughlin and talking about Gerstein. Those cases were about prospective relief. You're asking for retrospective relief. Why doesn't that make a difference? So, Mr. Yang, do you think it would be -- I -- I mean, I take the point completely that judgment was rendered against the wrong party here. But if the judgment had been rendered against Ms. Symczyk -- for Ms. Symczyk, but -- but the court had done so prior to looking at the whole class question-- --do you think that that would be an abuse of the court's discretion? Do you think that the court has to look at the class question before rendering judgment for an individual plaintiff?

2012,Chaidez v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, Mr. Fisher, think about this in an AEDPA context. I mean, assume that you have these ten circuit courts all going in the way that the Chief Justice said, and then one court came along and said, you know, we think that they -- in an AEDPA context, a habeas consideration of a state conviction -- we think that this is all wrong, and, in fact, the law is exactly the opposite of what ten circuits have held. Wouldn't we think that that's a very easy case that the AEDPA standard had not been met? Mr. Fisher, it would seem to me that this case presents a kind of threshold question. Before you get to the question of what are prevailing professional norms and whether they have been complied with, there is the question of whether the Sixth Amendment applies to collateral consequences at all and, if so, which collateral consequences. And that is the question on which Padilla opines, and that's the question that seems, you know, very different from anything that Strickland discussed, not just an application of Strickland. Well, but even before the 1996 act, deportation -- there were deportation consequences. Those consequences were enhanced by the 1996 act; but, even before that, a reasonable lawyer, you might think, would have a conversation with his client about the deportation consequences of a conviction. Mr. Fisher, before you get to the reasons-- --the government says that you forfeited this argument. Could you address that? But you haven't presented this argument to any court before; is that right? Mr. Dreeben, if Justice Breyer were right, that there should be sort of one run -- run up the flagpole and that Teague doesn't kick in until that one run up the flagpole and here because of Massaro the one run should include collateral review of IAC claims, if that's right, what are the costs of that? Is that an extra year to the statute of limitations for bringing a collateral claim or is it something more than that? ",well mr fisher think about this in an aedpa context i mean assume that you have these ten circuit court all go in the way that the chief justice say and then one court come along and say you know we think that they in an aedpa context a habeas consideration of a state conviction we think that this be all wrong and in fact the law be exactly the opposite of what ten circuit have hold would not we think that that be a very easy case that the aedpa standard have not be meet mr fisher it would seem to me that this case present a kind of threshold question before you get to the question of what be prevail professional norm and whether they have be comply with there be the question of whether the sixth amendment applies to collateral consequence at all and if so which collateral consequence and that be the question on which padilla opines and that be the question that seem you know very different from anything that strickland discuss not just an application of strickland well but even before the act deportation there we be deportation consequence those consequence we be enhance by the act but even before that a reasonable lawyer you might think would have a conversation with his client about the deportation consequence of a conviction mr fisher before you get to the reason the government say that you forfeit this argument could you address that but you have not present this argument to any court before be that right mr dreeben if justice breyer we be right that there should be sort of one run run up the flagpole and that teague do not kick in until that one run up the flagpole and here because of massaro the one run should include collateral review of iac claim if that be right what be the cost of that be that an extra year to the statute of limitation for bring a collateral claim or be it something more than that ,121.69,Roberts Court,"Nov 1, 2012",Roselva Chaidez,United States,11-820,"Apr 30, 2012","Feb 20, 2013",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2012,Lozman v. Riviera Beach,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, then you're not talking about purpose; you're talking about function, right? You're just using purpose as a kind of strange synonym for function. But you're not talking about purpose of either the homeowner or the manufacturer of the boat. You're just saying what does this -- or what does this thing, this floating home, do. Right. So you are really talking about a function test. And you are using strange words, because they come out of our opinions -- kind of not your fault. But you're really saying that what should apply here is a function test. We are looking at this floating home. What does it do? Is it just a thing that sits, or is it a thing that transports things over water. Isn't that your test? Well, how do we know that. How do we know that, Mr. Fisher? I mean, maybe these floating homes are just a poor man's houseboat, right? But the point of getting a floating home is actually to have a home that you can hook up to a boat and move from place to place, and so you don't have to, you know, have the motor running all the time or have the capacity to move it all the time, but when you want to move it on water and when you want to move your possessions on water, you have the capacity to do so. So, Mr. Gannon, you think that even at the moment that the thing is being transported, and let's say that the thing has, you know, various furniture and things on it, you think even at that moment under section 3, it's not a -- it might not be a vessel? Take the inner tube and, you know, paste a couple of pennies on the inner tube. Now it carries things. There are things on the inner tube, and it floats. Well, suppose, Mr. Frederick, this. Suppose we had a trial on the question of whether these floating homes or this floating home was a vessel, and we found out that actually 99 percent of people who buy floating homes move it exactly once. They purchase the floating home and then they move it to the place where they want the home to be, and then it sits there. And this was just a clear evidence that, you know, except if there's a hurricane or a tornado, people do not move floating homes. They buy it, they move it to where they want to live, and then it sits. In that case, do you think the thing is a vessel? Well, it's a statute-- --You are reading the statute -- you are reading the statute as if it says something can be transported over water. But the statute doesn't say that. It says something can be used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water. So that -- that the question is whether this thing is transporting other things over water, and whether that's its function; and in my hypothetical it's not its function. Its function is to serve as a house. That house happens to be on water but it's just a house. Mr. Frederick, if that is the case, then your test really comes down to how securely is something fastened. I mean, you have to deal with Evansville's wharf boat and Cage's dry dock, and you have to deal with all these floating casinos and restaurants. And you're saying that in all these cases we are supposed to look to is it a rope or is it a cable, how many cables, how quickly can it be disengaged, and that that's going to end up being the test that you would have us adopt which is how easy it is to get out of the port.

2012,United States v. Davila,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, on that, what's the most minor thing that the government could do that would still count as a Rule 11(c)(1) violation? That the judge could do. I'm sorry. Well, Mr. Yablon, have we ever said that about the violation of a rule of criminal procedure, that it's structural error no matter what the circumstances? You worked for her, too, I think. I would think, Mr. Yablon, that one of the effects of what you are asking us to do is that the rule would just get narrower and narrower. In other words, if automatic reversal is always the effect of finding a violation -- and I think you acknowledge this in a way -- that people will just find fewer and fewer violations. And I'm wondering why we should do something like that rather than interpret the rule as it was meant to be interpreted, but then say: You know, somebody can look and say it really just didn't matter that it was violated in this case. But that seems a bit odd, don't you think, Mr. Yablon? You know, you're saying, well, there are core violations as opposed to noncore violations. I mean, presumably, that's part of what the Court would think about when it was doing prejudice analysis. Mr. Yablon, do you know of any case where there is one of these core violations, these exhortation cases, where the Court did not find prejudice? Mr. Feigin, can I ask you the same question that I asked Mr. Yablon: Do you know of any cases where in these -- where there are really core violations, where a judge exhorts the defendant to plea it -- does the Court ever find that non-prejudicial?

2012,Standard Fire Insurance Company v. Knowles,114,Elena Kagan,"You say what Congress is concerned about and point to the Senate report. You know, usually we look to the text and the text makes very clear that Congress was concerned about many things and it did many things. It got -- it really -- it raised the matter in controversy threshold. It eliminated the Zahn anti-aggregation rule. It eliminated the complete diversity requirement. It eliminated the one-year limit on removal. Here's one thing it didn't eliminate. It didn't eliminate the St. Paul master of your complaint rule. So I guess where in the text do you see this? You point to claim, the word “ claim ”. Is that the only thing that you are resting on in the text? Well, if I said to you, Mr. Boutrous ""Is your claim for over $100,000? "" what would you think I mean? Would you think I mean some sort of abstract version of the best claim you could bring, or would you think I mean what I demanded, what I asked for? Do you think that the word “ claim ” is not -- when you say Joe made a claim for $100,000, a claim is not what he asked for, but is instead some kind of law professor's view of what the best thing that he could have asked for? But he doesn't have power to affect those claims before the certification has happened. Before the certification has happened, they can do whatever they want. They can bring their own claim for $6 million. And that's why Smith v. Bayer, which you so happily rely on, does not have much to do with this case. Smith v. Bayer is the question -- can a person be precluded by a judgment when that person was not part of a class. There's no question that this person is going to be precluded. This person can go do whatever he or she wants before class certification and judgment. Mr. Boutrous, that form of argument -- Congress could have said -- does seem to me to be much worse for your position. If Congress had wanted to get rid of the St. Paul master of your complaint rule, it could have said: We are getting rid of the St. Paul master of your complaint rule. But you're trying to find it in a position which is really an anti-Zahn position, not an anti-St. Paul provision. Let's get back to the Chief Justice's question, because there are a thousand ways in which we let the named plaintiff prior to certification construct a case, and then we ask, as Justice Sotomayor said, later we ask, is the way he's constructed a case adequate or not, and we allow him to go forward or not based on that. But he gets to decide whether to seek damages. He gets -- at all, or whether he only can seek injunctive relief. He gets to decide which claims to bring, trespass or negligence. He gets to decide how many years' worth to ask for. He gets to decide which defendants to sue. All of these things are going to have an effect on -- on the amount that's -- that's being asked for. And yet in all of these ways, we allow for -- maybe you're telling me no -- do we stop the named plaintiff from doing all -- all of those things, too? It's binding if the class is certified and the case proceeds to judgment. It's not binding on the absent class members prior to certification and prior to judgment. I think I don't understand that, Mr. Boutrous, because what you have, given that this is a State which says that these stipulations are binding if it proceeds, if there's certification and if it proceeds to judgment, you have a cap of $5 million. You cannot be charged more than $5 million under this State's law, if this case ever gets to judgment. Well, Congress was concerned about suits of over $5 million. And -- and the question here is, is this a suit of over $5 million. Now, if it is a suit over $5 million, a State court is bound by the due process clause and a State court is going to find, look, you're just giving these plaintiffs' claims away. We're not going to allow you to do that. You're not an adequate representative. On the other hand, in a case like this where it's $5,024,000 and it only gets there because you've added on one and a half million dollars of legal fees, the Court might very well say you are an adequate representative, go for it. Now, usually we don't question State court judgments of that kind. Why should we do so here? Mr. Boutrous, as you think -- you have to be careful about two different uses of the word “ binding ”. It has no binding effect right now on an absent class member; they can go out and bring their own suit. If the -- the named plaintiff is found to be adequate and the suit goes forward and goes to judgment, then the stipulation does indeed have binding effect and -- and you have not been exposed to more than $5 million. It's binding -- it is binding on everybody if there's a finding of adequate representation and if this goes forward as a class action; then it's binding and you haven't been exposed. And they can remove no matter when that happen; is that right, as a result of CAFA, because CAFA took off the one year limit? Can I ask you this, because I have been trying to figure out exactly what Mr. Boutrous is concerned about? And one thing he might be concerned about is that, notwithstanding that the class has really plans for $20 million, the thing is going to be certified for $5 million, and all these absent class members are -- are being deprived of something meaningful to them. But that's something which -- you know usually, we assume that State court judges will do their jobs, will pay attention to the Constitution, will apply adequacy of representation standards that come from the due process clause. So that seems like a strange thing to worry about in interpreting this Federal statute. The other possibility is that you might be worried that this stipulation won't be really as binding as you say, that in a case in which there is an adequacy of representation determination made, the class goes forward, and then things work out and it really looks like all these absent class members are going to get -- you know, badly treated. He's going to tear this stipulation up or do something like that. And it's going to be way down the line. And why should we allow that to happen? But this is -- he's done the certification, now it turns out that the certification was wrong, that in fact, these claims are worth a good deal more. And he says, I can't in good faith allow all these people's claims to be adjudicated for this amount of money when I know they're worth five times as much. Mr. Boutrous, you know, a lot of your brief talks about this problem of discovery. And it may very well be that there is a significant one, I don't know, but when you look at CAFA, I mean, CAFA did a lot of things. And it did not address this problem that you have with discovery. There could be -- I can give you, you know, ten different proposals that would enable you to bypass expensive discovery, but CAFA didn't do any of them. And this is a kind of a jerry-rigged solution to get at a problem that Congress, in fact, did not address. Mr. Boutrous, the idea of master of the complaint is inherent in every class litigation because there could be no class action, there could be no definition of anything, of the claims, of the amount of damages, of the number of defendants, of the amount of time unless the plaintiff, the named plaintiff, had some ability to define the claim. And this is just one aspect of that larger power. Okay. Then you really are asking us to blow up the whole world. Because you're saying: Next time we will be back and tell you that the named plaintiff can't define the clans. Next time we are going to be back and tell you that they can't name the defendants. ",you say what congress be concern about and point to the senate report you know usually we look to the text and the text make very clear that congress be concern about many thing and it do many thing it get it really it raise the matter in controversy threshold it eliminate the zahn anti aggregation rule it eliminate the complete diversity requirement it eliminate the one year limit on removal here s one thing it do not eliminate it do not eliminate the st paul master of your complaint rule so i guess where in the text do you see this you point to claim the word claim be that the only thing that you be rest on in the text well if i say to you mr boutrous be your claim for over what would you think i mean would you think i mean some sort of abstract version of the best claim you could bring or would you think i mean what i demand what i ask for do you think that the word claim be not when you say joe make a claim for a claim be not what he ask for but be instead some kind of law professor s view of what the best thing that he could have ask for but he do not have power to affect those claim before the certification have happen before the certification have happen they can do whatever they want they can bring their own claim for million and that be why smith v bayer which you so happily rely on do not have much to do with this case smith v bayer be the question can a person be preclude by a judgment when that person be not part of a class there be no question that this person be go to be preclude this person can go do whatever he or she want before class certification and judgment mr boutrous that form of argument congress could have say do seem to me to be much bad for your position if congress have want to get rid of the st paul master of your complaint rule it could have say we be get rid of the st paul master of your complaint rule but you be try to find it in a position which be really an anti zahn position not an anti st paul provision

the class be certify and the case proceeds to judgment it be not bind on the absent class member prior to certification and prior to judgment i think i do not understand that mr boutrous because what you have give that this be a state which say that these stipulation be bind if it proceed if there be certification and if it proceed to judgment you have a cap of million you can not be charge more than million under this state s law if this case ever get to judgment well congress be concern about suit of over million and and the question here be be this a suit of over million now if it be a suit over million a state court be bind by the due process clause and a state court be go to find look you be just give these plaintiff claim away we be not go to allow you to do that you be not an adequate representative on the other hand in a case like this where it be and it only get there because you have add on one and a half million dollar of legal fee the court might very well say you be an adequate representative go for it now usually we do not question state court judgment of that kind why should we do so here mr boutrous as you think you have to be careful about two different us of the word bind it have no bind effect right now on an absent class member they can go out and bring their own suit if the the name plaintiff be find to be adequate and the suit go forward and go to judgment then the stipulation do indeed have bind effect and and you have not be expose to more than million it be bind it be bind on everybody if there be a finding of adequate representation and if

2012,Descamps v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Johnson, can I try what Justice Alito is getting at maybe in a slightly a different way. And it's really the argument that the Ninth Circuit made, which is that you can take any indivisible statute, indivisible statute, and you can reimagine it as a statute with divisible elements, and Justice Alito gave one example of that. And the question to the Ninth Circuit says, is, once we've said that we can look to Shepard documents when we have a divisible statute, why not apply the same reasoning when we have an indivisible statute, given that any indivisible statute can kind of be reframed in our heads as a divisible one? And so your principal argument isn't that -- is that what we've said in the modified categorical cases is that you look to these Shepard documents to help you define the elements of the offense. So if you're not sure which offense the person has been convicted of, you look to the Shepard documents to do that. But you don't look to the Shepard documents for a different purpose, which is, we know what the elements of the offense are, but we want to know whether this person also committed the generic offense. Yes, I think -- here's, I guess, the rub, which is -- you know, I take the point that what the Ninth Circuit has said does not seem very categorical. It doesn't seem categorical, it doesn't seem modified categorical. But there is something a little bit insane about your position. I don't see -- you take the most populous State in the country and everybody who's convicted of burglary in the most populous State in the country is not going to have committed an ACCA offense, even though, as Justice Breyer suggested, 98 percent of them really have. Mr. Horwich-- --I'm going to ask you about an argument you did make. As I understand your argument, your argument is not the Ninth Circuit's argument, because you very carefully distinguish what are what you call missing elements cases from this case. So do you reject the Ninth Circuit's view that the categorical approach should apply even where there is a missing element, as you -- as you call it? Let me give you a -- let me give you a different kind of example. Let's suppose you have a statute that's made it illegal to interfere with a law enforcement investigation. And you're prosecuting somebody, maybe the person is pleading, maybe he goes to trial; it doesn't matter. The theory of the case is that the defendant violated this statute, interference with a law enforcement investigation, by assaulting a police officer, okay? Is that a missing elements case or is that what you think is going on here, which is just -- it's just an overbroad statute? The conviction is interference with a law enforcement investigation. That's the statute. But interference with a law enforcement investigation can be done in extremely -- it can be done in an extremely violent way, which would be an ACCA offense or not. And it's overbroad. There are ACCA offenses in it, but there are also non-ACCA offenses in it. Sure. Well, why would there be any difference between those two? Why would you take your argument differently from the residual clause than in the enumerated crimes? Okay. Well, let me -- let's talk about this case, then. I mean, I'm not sure I understand that quite. But let's talk about the burglary. Suppose that there was a State that just said entry. In other words, this State says unlawful entry and you say that's overbroad, but we're still in sort of the same universe of an element. Suppose the State just said entry. Would we be in a missing element world or in an overbroad world? But this reading creates its own idiosyncrasies. I mean, suppose the same plea colloquy had taken place and the prosecutor, instead of saying, you know, the defendant broke and entered, he had said: The defendant unlawfully entered, right? Completely different result under your theory; isn't that right? I think it's -- I think it's a deeper problem than that, because the defendant is standing there and he doesn't care at all whether the prosecutor says unlawfully entered or broke and entered. It doesn't matter a whit to him. And so -- and so something is -- is-- --the difference between an enhanced sentence and not an enhanced sentence that is not likely to be thought about, let alone adjudicated. I guess it depends on whether the basis has any relevance to the punishment he's going to receive, which in this case it doesn't, but put that aside. Here's one thing that strikes me as odd about your position. You said before in response to a question -- you said if the California Supreme Court had not decided Gauze, then you would not be up here arguing what you're arguing. Yes, if there were -- if there were no unlawful entry that counted under California law-- --but, you know, the fact that there is a strange Gauze case which says that you can't burglarize your own home -- right -- the fact that the Court happens to come across that case and happens to decide -- it seems completely irrelevant as to this matter whether or not the California court once decided that you can't burglarize your own home. What does that have to do with anything in this case? ",mr johnson can i try what justice alito be get at maybe in a slightly a different way and it be really the argument that the ninth circuit make which be that you can take any indivisible statute indivisible statute and you can reimagine it as a statute with divisible element and justice alito give one example of that and the question to the ninth circuit say be once we have say that we can look to shepard document when we have a divisible statute why not apply the same reasoning when we have an indivisible statute give that any indivisible statute can kind of be reframed in our head as a divisible one and so your principal argument be not that be that what we have say in the modified categorical case be that you look to these shepard document to help you define the element of the offense so if you be not sure which offense the person have be convict of you look to the shepard document to do that but you do not look to the shepard document for a different purpose which be we know what the element of the offense be but we want to know whether this person also commit the generic offense yes i think here s i guess the rub which be you know i take the point that what the ninth circuit have say do not seem very categorical it do not seem categorical it do not seem modified categorical but there be something a little bit insane about your position i do not see you take the most populous state in the country and everybody who be convict of burglary in the most populous state in the country be not go to have commit an acca offense even though as justice breyer suggest percent of them really have mr horwich I be go to ask you about an argument you do make as i understand your argument your argument be not the ninth circuit s argument because you very carefully distinguish what be what you call miss element case from this case so do you reject the ninth circuit s view that the categorical approach should apply even where there be a missing element as you as you call it let me give you a let me give you a different kind of example let us suppose you have a statute that be make it illegal to interfere with a law enforcement investigation and you be prosecute somebody maybe the person be plead maybe he go to trial it do not matter the theory of the case be that the defendant violate this statute interference with a law enforcement investigation by assault a police officer okay be that a missing element case or be that what you think be go on here which be just it be just an overbroad statute the conviction be interference with a law enforcement investigation that be the statute but interference with a law enforcement investigation can be do in extremely it can be do in an extremely violent way which would be an acca offense or not and it be overbroad there be acca offense in it but there be also non acca offense in it sure well why would there be any difference between those two why would you take your argument differently from the residual clause than in the enumerated crime okay well let me let us talk about this case then i mean I be not sure i understand that quite but let us talk about the burglary suppose that there be a state that just say entry in other word this state say unlawful entry and you say that be overbroad but we be still in sort of the same universe of an element suppose the state just say entry would we be in a missing element world or in an overbroad world but this reading create its own idiosyncrasy i mean suppose the same plea colloquy have take place and the prosecutor instead of say you know the defendant break and enter he have say the defendant unlawfully enter right completely different result under your theory be not that right i think it be i think it be a deep problem than that because the defendant be stand there and he do not care at all whether the prosecutor say unlawfully enter or break and enter it do not matter a whit to him and so and so something be be the difference between an enhanced sentence and not an enhanced sentence that be not likely to be think about let alone adjudicate i guess it depend on whether the basis have any relevance to the punishment he be go to receive which in this case it do not but put that aside here s one thing that strike me as odd about your position you say before in response to a question you say if the california supreme court have not decide gauze then you would not be up here argue what you be argue yes if there we be if there we be no unlawful entry that count under california law but you know the fact that there be a strange gauze case which say that you can not burglarize your own home right the fact that the court happen to come across that case and happen to decide it seem completely irrelevant as to this matter whether or not the california court once decide that you can not burglarize your own home what do that have to do with anything in this case ,325.28,Roberts Court,"Jan 7, 2013",Matthew R.

2012,United States v. Kebodeaux,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Dreeben, it would help me in answering some of these questions if you went through the analysis on the assumption that this was instead a Commerce Clause case. So take the military out of it; what would the necessary and proper analysis look like? How about if he is on supervised release? He is not in the military, but his entire sentence has not been completed. I guess, Ms. Fuentes, what I don't quite understand about the argument, this goes back to Justice Alito's original question. You seem to say that if this -- if Congress passed a civil statute like this one within the time that Mr. Kebodeaux was in custody or within the time that he was under supervised release, that that would be appropriate. But I guess what I don't get is why the Federal interests change, whether it's the day before he gets out of supervised release or the day after he gets out of supervised release. What in the Federal interests shift based on that? Well, I wasn't assuming that he was in the military while he was on supervised release. I was assuming that he was out of the military in both these cases, but that you said while he was still serving his sentence, it would be appropriate for Congress to add this additional thing, but not after. In both cases, he's not in the military anymore. I -- I guess what I'm not understanding, Ms. Fuentes, is -- I understand the difference between a requirement of registration and a penalty for failing to register, but it's a little bit cutting -- slicing the baloney thin. And if you think that he was in any event while he was undergoing his sentence subject to a penalty, it's a pretty minor exercise of Federal power, isn't it, to say that, instead of making you just subject to a penalty for doing something, we're going to tell you, you have to do it? ",mr dreeben it would help me in answer some of these question if you go through the analysis on the assumption that this be instead a commerce clause case so take the military out of it what would the necessary and proper analysis look like how about if he be on supervised release he be not in the military but his entire sentence have not be complete i guess ms fuentes what i do not quite understand about the argument this go back to justice alito s original question you seem to say that if this if congress pass a civil statute like this one within the time that mr kebodeaux be in custody or within the time that he be under supervised release that that would be appropriate but i guess what i do not get be why the federal interest change whether it be the day before he get out of supervised release or the day after he get out of supervised release what in the federal interest shift base on that well i be not assume that he be in the military while he be on supervised release i be assume that he be out of the military in both these case but that you say while he be still serve his sentence it would be appropriate for congress to add this additional thing but not after in both case he be not in the military anymore i i guess what I be not understanding ms fuentes be i understand the difference between a requirement of registration and a penalty for fail to register but it be a little bit cut slice the baloney thin and if you think that he be in any event while he be undergo his sentence subject to a penalty it be a pretty minor exercise of federal power be not it to say that instead of make you just subject to a penalty for do something we be go to tell you you have to do it ,108.17,Roberts Court,"Apr 17, 2013",United States,Anthony James Kebodeaux,12-418,"Jan 11, 2013","Jun 24, 2013",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2012,Sebelius v. Auburn Regional Medical Center,114,Elena Kagan,"But, Mr. Kneedler, do you think you could do the same thing in the veterans' benefits context? Because in Henderson, of course, we dropped a footnote saying that we weren't deciding whether equitable tolling was available. All we were saying was that this was a claims processing rule and not a jurisdictional rule. Could the Secretary of Veterans Affairs then go on and say, okay, it's a claims processing rule, but, still, we get to decide how much equitable tolling we want, and we're going to adopt a regulation, much like the one in this case, saying you can't come in after 3 years? Could you do that in Henderson? I guess the question I was trying to ask, Mr. Kneedler, was do you think it's a general principle of administrative law that when there is a claims processing rule that relates only to internal agency process, that the agency gets to decide how much, if any, equitable tolling to allow? I mean, you don't need that label, do you, Mr. Kneedler? You could do just as well with a claims processing label. Maybe you could do better, as Justice Scalia is suggesting, with a claims processing label, as long as with that label comes the general rule that the agency gets to determine the extent of discretion as to late filings. But, Mr. Roth, on the legal question here, I think Justice Breyer is right that this all comes down to congressional intent, how we read this statute. One response to reading the briefs in this case is that you and Mr. Manning present opposite views of the statute and both of you say the statute is clear as to your opposite view. In other words, Mr. Manning says the statute clearly prohibits equitable tolling and you say the statute clearly requires equitable tolling. And both of you have kind of decent arguments, and one response to that might be to say Mr. Kneedler is right that the statute is just ambiguous and that it can be read a bunch of different ways, and both of you have presented good arguments, but in the end it really all goes to show that there is a lack of clarity here and then it's up to the agency to decide. Mr. Roth, I'm not certain about the extent of your argument, so let me -- let me try something. Are you saying that any time Congress passes a statute saying, you know, there is 30 days to do this, there is 60 days to do this, in the agency context now as to administrative process, that Congress necessarily means that equitable tolling applies and that the agency cannot limit that equitable tolling? I guess I'm not sure I understand this, Mr. Roth. Are you saying that in all of our cases about the presumption in favor of equitable tolling, when we talk about equitable tolling we are only talking about misconduct or fraud cases? You know, as opposed to the case where it's just a person cannot possibly know the -- the information that would back up a claim, and that we regard that as a good excuse. Right. Well, that most of your argument was built on the presumption in favor of equitable tolling that we've recognized in those cases-- --and whether it applied to the agency context. But now you're saying that in the agency context, it's -- it's a different kind of equitable tolling that we are talking about, a more limited kind? ",but mr kneedler do you think you could do the same thing in the veteran benefit context because in henderson of course we drop a footnote say that we be not decide whether equitable tolling be available all we we be say be that this be a claim processing rule and not a jurisdictional rule could the secretary of veteran affair then go on and say okay it be a claim processing rule but still we get to decide how much equitable toll we want and we be go to adopt a regulation much like the one in this case say you can not come in after year could you do that in henderson i guess the question i be try to ask mr kneedler be do you think it be a general principle of administrative law that when there be a claim processing rule that relate only to internal agency process that the agency get to decide how much if any equitable toll to allow i mean you do not need that label do you mr kneedler you could do just as well with a claim process label maybe you could do well as justice scalia be suggest with a claim process label as long as with that label come the general rule that the agency get to determine the extent of discretion as to late filing but mr roth on the legal question here i think justice breyer be right that this all come down to congressional intent how we read this statute one response to read the brief in this case be that you and mr man present opposite view of the statute and both of you say the statute be clear as to your opposite view in other word mr man say the statute clearly prohibit equitable tolling and you say the statute clearly require equitable tolling and both of you have kind of decent argument and one response to that might be to say mr kneedler be right that the statute be just ambiguous and that it can be read a bunch of different way and both of you have present good argument but in the end it really all go to show that there be a lack of clarity here and then it be up to the agency to decide mr roth I be not certain about the extent of your argument so let me let me try something be you say that any time congress pass a statute say you know there be day to do this there be day to do this in the agency context now as to administrative process that congress necessarily mean that equitable toll applies and that the agency can not limit that equitable tolling i guess I be not sure i understand this mr roth be you say that in all of our case about the presumption in favor of equitable tolling when we talk about equitable tolling we be only talk about misconduct or fraud case you know as oppose to the case where it be just a person can not possibly know the the information that would back up a claim and that we regard that as a good excuse right well that most of your argument be build on the presumption in favor of equitable toll that we have recognize in those case and whether it apply to the agency context but now you be say that in the agency context it be it be a different kind of equitable toll that we be talk about a more limited kind ,209.72000000000008,Roberts Court,"Dec 4, 2012","Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of Health and Human Services",Auburn Regional Medical Center et al.,11-1231,"Jun 25, 2012","Jan 22, 2013",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2012,Gabelli v. Securities and Exchange Commission,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Liman, what you suggested, when we talked about the discovery rule, is that it has a basis in the notion that a defendant with unclean hands who has committed deceptive conduct preventing the plaintiff from understanding that he or it has a cause of action, you know, shouldn't be entitled to the benefit of a statute of limitations. And if that's the understanding that lies behind the discovery rule, I guess the question for you is, why doesn't it apply in this case as well as in the case where the person bringing the action has himself suffered a harm? It is true, though, isn't it, that Justice Scalia pointed to an anomaly that could easily exist in other contexts, because this isn't only a statute about securities violations. So that you might have in other contexts in which this statute applies a world in which a private individual could sue, but the government -- could sue after the -- the period of time-- --the 5 years, but the government could not. And I take it that your view would be that a case like Exploration, it's different than this case because it does have a natural start date; is that the idea? But, Mr. Wall, I'll go even further than Justice Ginsburg. And this case actually seems to me a good example when Mr. Liman said there's no natural starting point and Justice Kennedy and Justice Alito referred to just -- this is a -- this is a decision about enforcement priorities. The Government had decided not to go after market timers. And it changed its decision when a State attorney general decided to do it, and it embarrassed them that they had made that enforcement priority decision, and then the Government made a different enforcement priority decision. But that's not the kind of situation that the discovery rule was intended to operate on, is it? Mr. Wall, why is it that you don't you have any cases? I mean, you said way back when: This didn't come up, this is a modern problem. So explain to me why this is a modern problem. This is obviously an old statute. Are you saying that this statute has not been used very -- was not used very much until very, very recently? But what you're running up against is a skepticism, that, you know, the government, which has not asserted this power for 200 years, is now coming in and saying we want this. And the question is why hasn't the government asserted this power previously? ",mr liman what you suggest when we talk about the discovery rule be that it have a basis in the notion that a defendant with unclean hand who have commit deceptive conduct prevent the plaintiff from understand that he or it have a because of action you know should not be entitle to the benefit of a statute of limitation and if that be the understanding that lie behind the discovery rule i guess the question for you be why do not it apply in this case as well as in the case where the person bring the action have himself suffer a harm it be true though be not it that justice scalia point to an anomaly that could easily exist in other context because this be not only a statute about security violation so that you might have in other context in which this statute apply a world in which a private individual could sue but the government could sue after the the period of time the year but the government could not and i take it that your view would be that a case like exploration it be different than this case because it do have a natural start date be that the idea but mr wall I will go even far than justice ginsburg and this case actually seem to me a good example when mr liman say there be no natural start point and justice kennedy and justice alito refer to just this be a this be a decision about enforcement priority the government have decide not to go after market timer and it change its decision when a state attorney general decide to do it and it embarrass them that they have make that enforcement priority decision and then the government make a different enforcement priority decision but that be not the kind of situation that the discovery rule be intend to operate on be it mr wall why be it that you do not you have any case i mean you say way back when this do not come up this be a modern problem so explain to me why this be a modern problem this be obviously an old statute be you say that this statute have not be use very be not use very much until very very recently but what you be run up against be a skepticism that you know the government which have not assert this power for year be now come in and say we want this and the question be why have not the government assert this power previously ,151.91,Roberts Court,"Jan 8, 2013","Marc J.

2012,Amgen Inc. v. Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Waxman, that's just to say that a plaintiff can always relitigate the question of materiality. But at the class certification stage, isn't it correct that if the Court holds that a statement is immaterial, it's immaterial for all members of the class, and the suit has to be dismissed? Isn't that right? It can't proceed as an anything action, can it? I mean, the -- the remedy, if you had thought that the statement was immaterial, is not to say, I won't approve a class. It would be to say the suit has no merit. Well, do you mean to say that a judge who has just ruled that a statement is immaterial is going to keep the case in his court litigated by an individual plaintiff, even though he's just ruled that the statement is immaterial? So you're saying that a judge on a class certification stage can say: This is immaterial, the statement is immaterial; therefore, this can't proceed as a class action. But when a summary judgment motion comes in arguing the exact same thing, the judge will say: Oh, it's not immaterial after all, or it's disputed enough that the case can continue? I guess the question, Mr. Waxman, is if it is not immaterial as a matter of law at the summary judgment stage, how could a judge possibly say it is material at the class certification stage? So the class certification stage becomes kind of a super merits inquiry? --where the plaintiff has to -- has to surmount a higher burden on the merits? Mr. Waxman, that is right, and that's what we said in Walmart recently, that the question is a question of coherence; it's a question of whether the class wins or loses together. And here, for materiality, the class wins or loses together. If it's material, it's material as to everybody. If it's not material it's not material as to everybody. And that's just a function of the fact that materiality, as we've repeatedly said, is an objective test. It doesn't have anything to do with whether a particular person finds it material. And where that's the case, it seems to me that the Walmart test, which is, is an issue central to the -- you know, when you rule on the issue, do you rule on each of the claims in one stroke? The answer to that is yes. Mr. Waxman, I was saying that's right. There is class cohesion as to materiality. People win or lose on materiality together. What is that statement, Mr. Waxman? Because the difference is if there is an insufficient market, the case goes forward and people have to prove individual reliance, and that means that the class splits apart and you don't get a coherent class. So the function of your winning an argument either on publicity or on the efficient market is that the class becomes incoherent, that everybody then has to prove individual reliance. But that's not what happens when you prove immateriality. When you prove immateriality, the whole class falls together, because it's immaterial for everybody.

2012,Metrish v. Lancaster,114,Elena Kagan,"You -- you suggested, General, that the -- the fact that this is statutory makes your position easier. And I wonder if that's true. I mean, you could see an -- an argument the exact other way, which suggests that we all understand that common law changes and evolves over time, but that it's rare for a court to reverse a decision on what a statute means, and that that's not foreseeable in the same way. So -- now, especially if it were a single court saying the statute means A today, and then tomorrow it comes back and it says, no, it means B, whether that isn't actually -- whether that wouldn't cut against your position. Well, General, I guess I wonder whether it's relevant what the statute really says as opposed to what courts said it says. I mean, sometimes judges make errors and our law is dotted with places where courts have made errors and said that things mean what they don't mean or don't mean what they do mean, and, you know, we expect people to follow what the court says is the law even if there's really a better reading out there. And also, we think that people should rely on what the court says is the law, even though there's really a better reading out there. And so, you know, what does it matter if we come out and said -- and say, you know, what were these crazy Michigan courts doing? If that's what they were doing, it seems as though people had a right to rely on that. But was there anyone prior to 2001 who couldn't raise a defense like this, who was precluded from doing so because a court thought, oh, you know, the -- the statute really clears the field, and -- and this defense is not available? Was it -- can you point to anything? I guess they can point to just a lot of people who were raising this defense. This is -- I'm sorry. Do you have something like in the middle? [Laughter] And if you were a prosecutor, you would not have objected to that defense, would you have? Do you have any-- --have any reason to think that any prosecutor ever objected to such a defense? Just to go back to Justice Breyer's question. I mean, there may be no way you can answer this, but are we talking about, you know, do five people a year -- did five people a year raise this or -- or 20 or 100? I mean, what kind of numbers? Right. You can't really tell because nobody was objecting to anything-- --right?

2012,Marx v. General Revenue Corporation,114,Elena Kagan,"Ms. Blatt, it -- it seems to me that the -- the most natural way to read this statute, and it's not -- it's not your way, it's, look, we have this Federal Rule of Civil Procedure that -- that contemplates that Congress sometimes doesn't write -- it writes statutes authorizing lawsuits without providing a cost provision. And because we know that about Congress, we provide a default rule. And the default rule is what's laid out in subsection D as to costs and then also later as to attorney's fees. But, we know that Congress sometimes does address costs and fees, and where Congress in a particular statute has addressed costs and fees, we look to whatever Congress has said, you know, unless Congress has otherwise provided. And here this is -- 1692k is a provision that addresses costs and fees. It addresses them comprehensively and specifically. I expected you might. [Laughter] It's not a question of field preemption. Maybe I'm-- --not in the business of trying to figure out what Congress's intent is. All I'm trying to figure out is whether this Federal statute provides otherwise, and this Federal statute does provide otherwise. It's both. You know? And if I might say, I mean, you object to this statute; it's perfectly reasonable to say Congress should have written a separate provision about costs and attorney's fees, but for whatever bad, good or indifferent reason, Congress didn't; and so this statute basically says, here's what prevailing plaintiffs get as to both costs and fees; here is what prevailing defendants get-- --under what circumstances, as to both costs and fees, and those are the rules. This statute is very -- is very normal if it were just about fees, right? It would be just like the civil rights fees statutes, where it said prevailing plaintiffs get fees, but prevailing defendants only get fees upon some higher standard, here bad faith. What makes this statute different, and it is different, is that this statute twice says not only fees but also costs. Now you might say that's very uncommon, but in both sentences it says, we want the same rule for costs as we do for fees. Sorry. I'm sorry. Well, you say that, but it says to both. It says the costs together with the reasonable attorney's fees, and then the next sentence it says fees and costs. So you might wish that they were a different statute, and it might be good policy to have a different statute-- --I'm not in the business -- I'm not in the business of trying to figure out exactly what Congress is doing. I'm in the business of just reading what Congress did; and what Congress did is it created a set of rules that applies to attorney's fees and costs at the same time. That sounds very terrible. Well, Ms. Blatt, you say it -- it's supposed to make defendants better off by focusing on just part of the provision, but the provision is -- as a whole, it does a set of things. It treats plaintiffs and prevailing plaintiffs in a certain set of ways, and it treats prevailing defendants in a certain set of ways. Prevailing defendants, but when -- prevailing defendants are treated worse than prevailing plaintiffs, because they have to show that there is a bad faith lawsuit. Ms. Blatt, let me try it a different way. Let's just suppose that 54(k) didn't exist at all. 54(d) didn't exist. And all you had was this provision, okay? So this provision says on a finding by the court that it's brought in bad faith, the court may award to the defendant attorney's fees and costs. So suppose a defendant wins, but there's not a finding that it was made in bad faith, would then the person be entitled to either attorney's fees or costs? I'm saying that-- --In my world, you would not get fees or costs. I'm just asking you a simple question. You would not get costs under that provision. Okay. So if you would not get costs under that provision-- --under 1692, a provision that talks about fees and costs generally as to both plaintiffs and defendants, then how does a rule that says what -- where you would get costs unless a Federal statute provides otherwise change matters? You might be right, but suppose Congress wasn't thinking about Rule 54. Suppose it didn't occur to the drafters what Rule 54 said or what the default provision was. They just wrote a statute about fees and costs. And then -- it doesn't really matter whether they were thinking about Rule 54 or not. Well, that's -- that's just a different way of saying the following: The first sentence says, when you're a prevailing plaintiff, you get costs and fees. How about defendants? Well, prevailing is not enough for defendants. Defendants have to show-- --that the suit was filed in bad faith-- --and then they get costs and fees. I completely agree with that. But that's what it comes down to, that if you think that Congress has to use super extraordinary language to over -- to -- to get out of 54(d), then you're right. But 54(d) doesn't say that. It just says-- --unless the Federal statute provides otherwise. I understood Ms. Blatt to actually agree with that, that if you put Rule 54 aside, this does say, ""You may, under a certain set of conditions. "" which implies you may not, under -- if those conditions are not met. ",ms blatt it it seem to me that the the most natural way to read this statute and it be not it be not your way it be look we have this federal rule of civil procedure that that contemplate that congress sometimes do not write it write statute authorize lawsuit without provide a cost provision and because we know that about congress we provide a default rule and the default rule be what be lay out in subsection d as to cost and then also later as to attorney s fee but we know that congress sometimes do address cost and fee and where congress in a particular statute have address cost and fee we look to whatever congress have say you know unless congress have otherwise provide and here this be k be a provision that address cost and fee it address them comprehensively and specifically i expect you might laughter it be not a question of field preemption maybe I be not in the business of try to figure out what congress s intent be all I be try to figure out be whether this federal statute provide otherwise and this federal statute do provide otherwise it be both you know and if i might say i mean you object to this statute it be perfectly reasonable to say congress should have write a separate provision about cost and attorney s fee but for whatever bad good or indifferent reason congress do not and so this statute basically say here s what prevail plaintiff get as to both cost and fee here be what prevail defendant get under what circumstance as to both cost and fee and those be the rule this statute be very be very normal if it we be just about fee right it would be just like the civil right fee statute where it say prevail plaintiff get fee but prevail defendant only get fee upon some high standard here bad faith what make this statute different and it be different be that this statute twice say not only fee but also cost now you might say that be very uncommon but in both sentence it say we want the same rule for cost as we do for fee sorry I be sorry well you say that but it say to both it say the cost together with the reasonable attorney s fee and then the next sentence it say fee and cost so you might wish that they we be a different statute and it might be good policy to have a different statute I be not in the business I be not in the business of try to figure out exactly what congress be do I be in the business of just read what congress do and what congress do be it create a set of rule that apply to attorney s fee and cost at the same time that sound very terrible well ms blatt you say it it be suppose to make defendant good off by focus on just part of the provision but the provision be as a whole it do a set of thing it treat plaintiff and prevail plaintiff in a certain set of way and it treat prevail defendant in a certain set of way prevail defendant but when prevailing defendant be treat bad than prevailing plaintiff because they have to show that there be a bad faith lawsuit ms blatt let me try it a different way let us just suppose that k do not exist at all d do not exist and all you have be this provision okay so this provision say on a finding by the court that it be bring in bad faith the court may award to the defendant attorney s fee and cost so suppose a defendant win but there be not a finding that it be make in bad faith would then the person be entitle to either attorney s fee or cost I be say that in my world you would not get fee or cost I be just ask you a simple question you would not get cost under that provision okay so if you would not get cost under that provision under a provision that talk about fee and cost generally as to both plaintiff and defendant then how do a rule that say what where you would get cost unless a federal statute provide otherwise change matter you might be right but suppose congress be not think about rule suppose it do not occur to the drafter what rule say or what the default provision be they just write a statute about fee and cost and then it do not really matter whether they we be think about rule or not well that be that be just a different way of say the following the first sentence say when you be a prevailing plaintiff you get cost and fee how about defendant well prevail be not enough for defendant defendant have to show that the suit be file in bad faith and then they get cost and fee i completely agree with that but that be what it come down to that if you think that congress have to use super extraordinary language to over to to get out of d then you be right but d do not say that it just say unless the federal statute provide otherwise i understand ms blatt to actually agree with that that if you put rule aside this do say you may under a certain set of conditions which imply you may not under if those condition be not meet ,317.7999999999999,Roberts Court,"Nov 7, 2012",Olivea Marx,General Revenue Corporation,11-1175,"May 29, 2012","Feb 26, 2013",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2012,Peugh v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"But isn't the important point, Mr. Kinnaird, that there's a presumption of correctness that attaches to guidelines sentences on appeal-- --that does not attach to non-guidelines sentences? I mean, this is, one would think, great legal consequence. But what that suggests is that the guidelines serve as an anchor and are supposed to serve as an anchor, and that the reason why the miscalculation is error is because you've picked the wrong anchor and that's going to affect or -- or has a significant likelihood of affecting your ultimate decision. And isn't that really what we've suggested is the way the guidelines ought to work, and the way you think the guidelines ought to work, that it serves as an anchor for sentencing decisions. Yes, you can vary, you can deviate, but it's your anchor. I think I'm saying more than it's all in your head. I think I'm saying you start in a particular place, you have to get the particular place right. The appellate court looks at the particular place that you've started and if you -- if you've ended up there, has to grant a presumption of reasonableness. But the rules are all geared towards saying, yes, you can deviate, but you have to understand that there's -- that -- deviation requires some kind of thought process and some kind of reason. Otherwise, this is where you should be. Mr. Feigin, you're sounding awfully like according deference to the guidelines counts as reversible error. But surely, you do not want judges living in a world where they think that they cannot give deference to the guidelines; isn't that right? You want them to give appropriate deference to the guidelines; isn't that correct? Mr. Feigin, take this example. Let's suppose that there's a crime and the punishment for crime is 5 years to life, all right? Now, Congress passes a statute and it says, no, we think this crime now is much more important than we used to, now it's 25 years to life, right? A -- a person commits the offense prior to that change. Absolutely obvious case, right, that you have to apply the -- the 5 years to life, right? Obvious, correct? Okay. Now, the Sentencing Commission does what the Sentencing Commission always does when there is a legislative change like this. It says, well, we have this guidelines that assumes 5 years to life. We have to change our guidelines because now it's 25 years to life. And it passes a guideline amendment which completely conforms to the legislative amendment. But you're saying, no, the 25-year-to-life guideline is the appropriate one to implement, even though the 5-year statute is the appropriate one to implement -- is the appropriate one to give effect to. Can that possibly be right? I think more goes into it than empirics. But there's this unbelievable chart really in one of the green briefs about -- you know, where there's one line which is what happens to the guidelines and there's this other line which is what happens to the sentence, and they follow each other identically, exactly. You can't get a chart that looks better from this than -- from Mr. Kinnaird's point of view. ",but be not the important point mr kinnaird that there be a presumption of correctness that attach to guideline sentence on appeal that do not attach to non guideline sentence i mean this be one would think great legal consequence but what that suggest be that the guideline serve as an anchor and be suppose to serve as an anchor and that the reason why the miscalculation be error be because you have pick the wrong anchor and that be go to affect or or have a significant likelihood of affect your ultimate decision and be not that really what we have suggest be the way the guideline ought to work and the way you think the guideline ought to work that it serve as an anchor for sentence decision yes you can vary you can deviate but it be your anchor i think I be say more than it be all in your head i think I be say you start in a particular place you have to get the particular place right the appellate court look at the particular place that you have start and if you if you have end up there have to grant a presumption of reasonableness but the rule be all geared towards say yes you can deviate but you have to understand that there be that deviation require some kind of thought process and some kind of reason otherwise this be where you should be mr feigin you be sound awfully like accord deference to the guideline count as reversible error but surely you do not want judge live in a world where they think that they can not give deference to the guideline be not that right you want them to give appropriate deference to the guideline be not that correct mr feigin take this example let us suppose that there be a crime and the punishment for crime be year to life all right now congress pass a statute and it say no we think this crime now be much more important than we use to now it be year to life right a a person commit the offense prior to that change absolutely obvious case right that you have to apply the the year to life right obvious correct okay now the sentence commission do what the sentence commission always do when there be a legislative change like this it say well we have this guideline that assume year to life we have to change our guideline because now it be year to life and it pass a guideline amendment which completely conform to the legislative amendment but you be say no the year to life guideline be the appropriate one to implement even though the year statute be the appropriate one to implement be the appropriate one to give effect to can that possibly be right i think more go into it than empirics but there be this unbelievable chart really in one of the green brief about you know where there be one line which be what happen to the guideline and there be this other line which be what happen to the sentence and they follow each other identically exactly you can not get a chart that look good from this than from mr kinnaird s point of view ,188.84000000000003,Roberts Court,"Feb 26, 2013",Marvin Peugh,United States,12-62,"Nov 9, 2012","Jun 10, 2013",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2012,Trevino v. Thaler,114,Elena Kagan,"So if everything -- if everything in Texas's system were the same, but you had a year, would that flip Texas into a different category? Is the problem, is what makes this impracticable just the amount of time? Please-- --Well, able to be brought, Mr. Oldham, but as Justice Ginsburg started off by saying, many times the court of criminal appeals has said the preferred method is to bring it on collateral appeal. And more to the point even, when attorneys try to bring these kinds of claims on a motion for a new trial, the typical response is to say, no, this is not the proper venue for that, go back and do it again on collateral review. So we have -- you say that there's a formal mechanism that could be used. But it seems as though the courts and the lawyers both in Texas are being told continually, don't use that form of mechanism. Instead, do this on collateral review. Well, isn't the usual response just to dismiss it without prejudice and to say, we don't have time to deal with this, go away, come back again on collateral review? Well, because mostly the record isn't sufficient for a Wiggins claim. So anytime somebody brings a Wiggins claim on this 30-day window, the Court says, you know, there's only 30 days. The record is insufficient. Go away, do it again. That's your one case, it seems to me. You only have one case. It's Armstrong. Armstrong seems to me sort of like proof as to why it is that the Texas courts don't do that generally, because what they did in Armstrong was they ended up trying to adjudicate that on the merits, and realizing that there was -- that the record wasn't sufficient. Do you agree, Mr. Oldham, that if you did not have the mechanism for a new trial, then you would form under the Martinez rule? In other words, no opportunity for factual development. Mr. Oldham, I had thought that Martinez was really an equitable rule. It was an equitable rule about giving people an opportunity to raise a trial ineffectiveness claim. And if it's true that although Texas has a technical possibility of doing that outside of collateral review, but in fact that the lawyers are told not to use that route, that the lawyers don't use that route, that if they do use that route the likelihood is that they will be thrown out for using that route, the question is why that, the formal availability of a mechanism that nobody uses and that everybody is told not to use should matter with respect to the application of an equitable rule like Martinez? So you are suggesting that if an attorney is appointed within a few days or within a week, as happened here, that in that case there would not be that opportunity, it would be the 30 days, that's it, stop. ",so if everything if everything in texas s system we be the same but you have a year would that flip texas into a different category be the problem be what make this impracticable just the amount of time please well able to be bring mr oldham but as justice ginsburg start off by say many time the court of criminal appeal have say the preferred method be to bring it on collateral appeal and more to the point even when attorney try to bring these kind of claim on a motion for a new trial the typical response be to say no this be not the proper venue for that go back and do it again on collateral review so we have you say that there be a formal mechanism that could be use but it seem as though the court and the lawyer both in texas be be tell continually do not use that form of mechanism instead do this on collateral review well be not the usual response just to dismiss it without prejudice and to say we do not have time to deal with this go away come back again on collateral review well because mostly the record be not sufficient for a wiggins claim so anytime somebody bring a wiggins claim on this day window the court say you know there be only day the record be insufficient go away do it again that be your one case it seem to me you only have one case it be armstrong armstrong seem to me sort of like proof as to why it be that the texas court do not do that generally because what they do in armstrong be they end up try to adjudicate that on the merit and realize that there be that the record be not sufficient do you agree mr oldham that if you do not have the mechanism for a new trial then you would form under the martinez rule in other word no opportunity for factual development mr oldham i have think that martinez be really an equitable rule it be an equitable rule about give people an opportunity to raise a trial ineffectiveness claim and if it be true that although texas have a technical possibility of do that outside of collateral review but in fact that the lawyer be tell not to use that route that the lawyer do not use that route that if they do use that route the likelihood be that they will be throw out for use that route the question be why that the formal availability of a mechanism that nobody us and that everybody be tell not to use should matter with respect to the application of an equitable rule like martinez so you be suggest that if an attorney be appoint within a few day or within a week as happen here that in that case there would not be that opportunity it would be the day that be it stop ,166.52000000000004,Roberts Court,"Feb 25, 2013",Carlos Trevino,"Rick Thaler, Director, Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Correctional Institutions Division",11-10189,"Oct 29, 2012","May 28, 2013",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2012,Sebelius v.

Do you think it would be within the discretion of the court or Special Master to look at a case and say, for whatever strange reason, this is a case where it's going to require some lengthy mini-trial in order to figure out fees and that's a bad use of everybody's time, so I'm not going to grant attorneys' fees here? In other words, you know, this is a “ may ” provision; would it be a sufficient reason that this is just going to take too long, it's too involved, so I'm going to deny attorneys' fees in this case? Mr. Fishman, this may be a hard question for you to answer, but is your sense of why it is that petitions are untimely filed that they usually have to do with things like, you know, snowstorms and lawyer error, or that they usually have to do with questions about the manifestation of symptoms?

2012,"City of Arlington, TX v. FCC",114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Goldstein, at one level you are right. It's just a level that doesn't help you very much. I mean, it's true that always there is an initial question of whether an agency is entitled to Chevron deference. But usually the way we answer that question is just this: We say is this the agency's organic statute? Yes. Does that organic statute provide the agency with lawmaking power? Has the agency acted in accordance with that -- under that lawmaking power? Well, then, the agency gets deference. We go on to the next thing, which is Step 1 and Step 2. So, you know, what we don't do is this sort of provision by provision, subsection by subsection, did Congress have a special intent as to this subject matter or that subject matter or the other subject matter? We've just had some very simple rules about what gets you into the box where an agency is entitled to deference. But take Meade, Mister -- I'm sorry. Meade presented -- whatever you think of Meade, it's a very different question from this, because what the majority in Meade said was that the agency wasn't entitled to deference because it was acting by way of these opinion letters that weren't -- that didn't have the force of law. So that's the threshold question is, does the agency have power to make rules with the force of law and is the agency exercising that power? That is a threshold question that has been set by this Court. It's a very different kind of question from provision by provision, subsection by subsection, did -- did Congress think that the agency had authority over this particular subject matter or not. Well, Mr. Goldstein, I think with respect, it's not silliness. You have been running as fast as you can away from the arguments that IMLA has presented that in every case it's a who, what, where, you know, or how question and that we have to answer that. But the question that General Verrilli raises, I think, is a fair question, is how your argument which says that we have to consider in each case as to each statutory provision whether an agency has interpretive authority is any different from IMLA's argument that we have to consider with -- in respect to every case whether we're dealing with a when, what, who, where question or a how question. It's the same argument, isn't it? Of course there's a threshold question, but the threshold question has always been is the agency interpreting its organic statute and is -- does that statute give the agency rule-making authority and is that what the agency is exercising. I guess I'm still waiting for -- for the -- the way in which your inquiry is different from IMLA's inquiry. ",mr goldstein at one level you be right it be just a level that do not help you very much i mean it be true that always there be an initial question of whether an agency be entitle to chevron deference but usually the way we answer that question be just this we say be this the agency s organic statute yes do that organic statute provide the agency with lawmaking power have the agency act in accordance with that under that lawmaking power well then the agency get deference we go on to the next thing which be step and step so you know what we do not do be this sort of provision by provision subsection by subsection do congress have a special intent as to this subject matter or that subject matter or the other subject matter we have just have some very simple rule about what get you into the box where an agency be entitle to deference but take meade mister I be sorry meade present whatever you think of meade it be a very different question from this because what the majority in meade say be that the agency be not entitle to deference because it be act by way of these opinion letter that be not that do not have the force of law so that be the threshold question be do the agency have power to make rule with the force of law and be the agency exercise that power that be a threshold question that have be set by this court it be a very different kind of question from provision by provision subsection by subsection do do congress think that the agency have authority over this particular subject matter or not well mr goldstein i think with respect it be not silliness you have be run as fast as you can away from the argument that imla have present that in every case it be a who what where you know or how question and that we have to answer that but the question that general verrilli raise i think be a fair question be how your argument which say that we have to consider in each case as to each statutory provision whether an agency have interpretive authority be any different from imla s argument that we have to consider with in respect to every case whether we be deal with a when what who where question or a how question it be the same argument be not it of course there be a threshold question but the threshold question have always be be the agency interpret its organic statute and be do that statute give the agency rule make authority and be that what the agency be exercise i guess I be still wait for for the the way in which your inquiry be different from imla s inquiry ,173.54000000000005,Roberts Court,"Jan 16, 2013","City of Arlington, TX; City of San Antonio, TX",Federal Communications Commission,11-1545,"Oct 5, 2012","May 20, 2013",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2012,Shelby County v. Holder,114,Elena Kagan,"But think about this State that you're representing, it's about a quarter black, but Alabama has no black statewide elected officials. If Congress were to write a formula that looked to the number of successful Section 2 suits per million residents, Alabama would be the number one State on the list. If you factor in unpublished Section 2 suits, Alabama would be the number two State on the list. If you use the number of Section 5 enforcement actions, Alabama would again be the number two State on the list. I mean, you're objecting to a formula, but under any formula that Congress could devise, it would capture Alabama. And in 1986 -- or excuse me, 2006 -- Congress went back to the problem, developed a very substantial record, a 15,000-page legislative record, talked about what problems had been solved, talked about what problems had yet to be solved, and decided that, although the problem had changed, the problem was still evident enough that the act should continue. It's hard to see how Congress could have developed a better and more thorough legislative record than it did, Mr. Rein. Well, that sounds like a good argument to me, Justice Scalia. It was clear to 98 Senators, including every Senator from a covered State, who decided that there was a continuing need for this piece of legislation. Well, the Fifteenth Amendment says “ denial or abridgement ”. What would “ abridgement ” mean except for dilution? Well, the formula that has-- --Well, Mr. Rein, the formula that -- that is applied right now, under that formula covered jurisdictions, which have less than 25 percent of the nation's total population, they account for 56 percent of all successful published Section 2 lawsuits. If you do that on a per capita basis, the successful Section 2 lawsuits, four times higher in covered jurisdictions than in noncovered jurisdictions. So the formula -- you can, you know, say maybe this district shouldn't be covered, maybe this one should be covered. The formula seems to be working pretty well in terms of going after the actual violations on the ground and who's committing them. Well, all formulas are underinclusive and all formulas are overinclusive. Congress has developed this formula and has continued it in use that actually seems to work pretty well in targeting the places where there are the most successful Section 2 lawsuits, where there are the most violations on the ground that have been adjudicated. Well, Mr. Rein-- --that is the question, isn't it? You said the problem has been solved. But who gets to make that judgment really? Is it you, is it the Court, or is it Congress? Well, that's a big, new power that you are giving us, that we have the power now to decide whether racial discrimination has been solved? I did not think that that fell within our bailiwick.

2012,Clapper v. Amnesty International USA,114,Elena Kagan,"General Verrilli-- --But, General Verrilli, this statute greatly expands the government's surveillance power. Nobody denies that. And so if the question from these lawyers' perspective is, what chance do I have of being overheard, and what precautions do I have to take, this statute makes them think about that question in an entirely different way, doesn't it? Yes, but if you take the baseline position before this statute and the position after this statute, these lawyers and other people in their situation are going to understand that this is just true, that the government is intercepting more material, and that they have to take greater precautions in order to keep their conversations confidential, if that's what they want to do, which lawyers want to do. So they're going to take precautions that they wouldn't have had to take the day before this statute was passed, it seems to me, just from a kind of commonsensical point of view. I guess I don't see why, General Verrilli, this case is any different from Monsanto. In Monsanto, the government deregulates genetically modified alfalfa, says, go plant it. Now, there were these farmers who were complaining, and they said, we don't know if that will contaminate our crops or not; we think that there's a significant risk that it will contaminate our crops. Because we think that there's that significant risk, we have to take precautions. Now, why isn't that exactly what's happening in this case? We now think, says the -- say the lawyers, that there is a significant risk that our conversations will be surveilled, a risk that didn't exist before. Because of that significant risk, we have to take precautions of the exact same kind that the farmers in Monsanto took; therefore, there is standing. I don't see that difference at all, General Verrilli-- --because, in fact, what Monsanto did -- it's not Congress; it's an agency -- but the agency issued a rule saying that farmers could go plant genetically modified crops. And then there was the question whether, because of that, essentially, delegation of authority, the plaintiffs in that case were going to be burdened. And the plaintiffs said, you know, we might be harmed, and we have to take precautions in order not to be harmed. So it's the same thing. It's a different actor, but it's a delegation of authority and a -- and a fear that that delegation of authority will result in harm leading to a set of precautions. Well, is it really such speculation, General? I mean, just imagine that -- yourself in this lawyer's position, and the lawyer says, I'm representing a person associated with a terrorist organization, I'm representing KLM in the case of one of these lawyers, and I'm going to be talking to that person's family members and associates and trying to find out everything that I can. Now, as a lawyer, would you take precautions, or would you pick up the phone and start writing e-mails to all those people? I don't even think it has to do with an ethics rule. If you're a good lawyer -- forget the ethics rule and how the ethics rules apply. Are you really going to tell me that you, as a lawyer, would just pick up the phone in the face of this statute and talk to these terrorists' associates? In Summers, the Court said-- --Excuse me. In Summers, the Court said, well, we don't know that this person is just going to stumble upon a piece of land that's affected by this government action. I asked you a different question. You're a lawyer representing a terrorist and talking to the terrorist's affiliates, and the question is, is this statute going to make you not use the e-mail in the way that you ordinarily would use the e-mail? Mr. Jaffer, it seems to me that your -- the government's strongest argument goes something like this -- and I don't think that they would say it in these words, but you have some clients where it actually does seem completely reasonable that they would take precautions, that they would not get on the phone, and that they would not use e-mail in the way that any old person would. But just -- those clients, these lawyers of terrorists, essentially shouldn't be using that e-mail or getting on the phone anyway. Even before the FAA was passed, they would have been wise and, indeed, maybe ethically required to use precautions. So what does the FAA do? I guess this is a point about redressability, it's a point about-- --causation, but that seems to me the strongest of the government's arguments. Do you have specifics in the affidavits of things that your clients would have done previously that they cannot do now? I'm sorry. Mr. Jaffer, you mentioned your journalist clients. Do you have any affidavits or anything else in the record to suggest that those journalists have simply not gotten information from third parties that they otherwise would have gotten? In other words, this would not be a question of what precautions they took and what precautions were reasonable. But if you assume that information is the lifeblood of journalism, that their sources and their information has dried up as a result of this statute. That's a fair point, General. What if it said something different? What if she said -- what if there were even an affidavit from the source saying, ""I have stopped talking with this journalist because of the FAA and because of my fear that my communications will be intercepted? "" No, General Verrilli, this is not about the merits of the statute. They might have no claim on the merits at all, and so there would be no question of invalidation. The question is only: Can they make their argument to a court? ",general verrilli but general verrilli this statute greatly expand the government s surveillance power nobody deny that and so if the question from these lawyer perspective be what chance do i have of be overheard and what precaution do i have to take this statute make them think about that question in an entirely different way do not it yes but if you take the baseline position before this statute and the position after this statute these lawyer and other people in their situation be go to understand that this be just true that the government be intercept more material and that they have to take great precaution in order to keep their conversation confidential if that be what they want to do which lawyer want to do so they be go to take precaution that they would not have have to take the day before this statute be pass it seem to me just from a kind of commonsensical point of view i guess i do not see why general verrilli this case be any different from monsanto in monsanto the government deregulate genetically modify alfalfa say go plant it now there we be these farmer who we be complain and they say we do not know if that will contaminate our crop or not we think that there be a significant risk that it will contaminate our crop because we think that there be that significant risk we have to take precaution now why be not that exactly what be happen in this case we now think say the say the lawyer that there be a significant risk that our conversation will be surveilled a risk that do not exist before because of that significant risk we have to take precaution of the exact same kind that the farmer in monsanto take therefore there be stand i do not see that difference at all general verrilli because in fact what monsanto do it be not congress it be an agency but the agency issue a rule say that farmer could go plant genetically modify crop and then there be the question whether because of that essentially delegation of authority the plaintiff in that case we be go to be burden and the plaintiff say you know we might be harm and we have to take precaution in order not to be harm so it be the same thing it be a different actor but it be a delegation of authority and a and a fear that that delegation of authority will result in harm leading to a set of precaution well be it really such speculation general i mean just imagine that yourself in this lawyer s position and the lawyer say I be represent a person associate with a terrorist organization I be represent klm in the case of one of these lawyer and I be go to be talk to that person s family member and associate and try to find out everything that i can now as a lawyer would you take precaution or would you pick up the phone and start write e mail to all those people i do not even think it have to do with an ethic rule if you be a good lawyer forget the ethic rule and how the ethic rule apply be you really go to tell me that you as a lawyer would just pick up the phone in the face of this statute and talk to these terrorist associate in summer the court say excuse me in summer the court say well we do not know that this person be just go to stumble upon a piece of land that be affect by this government action i ask you a different question you be a lawyer represent a terrorist and talk to the terrorist s affiliate and the question be be this statute go to make you not use the e mail in the way that you ordinarily would use the e mail mr jaffer it seem to me that your the government s strong argument go something like this and i do not think that they would say it in these word but you have some client where it actually do seem completely reasonable that they would take precaution that they would not get on the phone and that they would not use e mail in the way that any old person would but just those client these lawyer of terrorist essentially should not be use that e mail or get on the phone anyway even before the faa be pass they would have be wise and indeed maybe ethically require to use precaution so what do the faa do i guess this be a point about redressability it be a point about causation but that seem to me the strong of the government s argument do you have specific in the affidavit of thing that your client would have do previously that they can not do now I be sorry mr jaffer you mention your journalist client do you have any affidavit or anything else in the record to suggest that those journalist have simply not get information from third party that they otherwise would have get in other word this would not be a question of what precaution they take and what precaution we be reasonable but if you assume that information be the lifeblood of journalism that their source and their information have dry up as a result of this statute that be a fair point general what if it say something different what if she say what if there we be even an affidavit from the source say i have stop talk with this journalist because of the faa and because of my fear that my communication will be intercept no general verrilli this be not about the merit of the statute they might have no claim on the merit at all and so there would be no question of invalidation the question be only can they make their argument to a court ,321.5200000000001,Roberts Court,"Oct 29, 2012","James R.

2012,Levin v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Feldman-- --Mr. Feldman, as I understand your argument and the differences that you have with the government, you have one set of differences about the meaning of 1089(e), but then another set about this question of, if it were true that the government was immune from suit, could you bring a tort suit against the doctors? And the government said -- says no, and you say yes, you might be able to do that. But do you have to answer that question at all in order to say that you're correct on 1089(e)? So there is a lot of going back and forth about this question of what would happen if the government were immune, would the individual doctor be immune, but that is essentially irrelevant to the question before us; is that correct? Saying it a different way, I don't have to accept your broader argument. I can remain ambivalent about your broader argument and still accept your narrower argument? Is that correct? Well, let's go back to the text then, Mr. Shah. As I understand your argument, it goes something like this. This provision is there to -- to prevent people from drawing a mistaken inference. And the inference would be that the doctors were liable because the government was not. Now, there are a thousand ways to do that pretty clearly. You could just say: Irrespective of whether the government is liable, the doctors are not, or some such thing. But instead what Congress did was it enacted a kind of let's pretend provision, right? Let's pretend that the government is liable, so then the inference won't arise. Now, that has to be not just not the best way of achieving Congress's objective; it has to be the worst, right? Because then you're raising the inference that in fact the government is liable. Why would Congress have wanted to do that? I'm saying something more than that. It could not have written it in a worse way. But this is not a side issue, Mr. Shah. In fact, you used your understanding of 1089(e) as an argument to produce the result this Court reached in Smith. So it was -- it was not a very large issue, but it was -- it was an argument. You said, you know, we should reach the results that you wanted in Smith because 1089(e) would continue to have this effect. It was a supportive argument. I am not saying that it was the but-for argument, but it was clearly a supportive argument in your brief. Mr. Shah, your basic theory of the case, which is that in order to make absolutely certain that everyone gets the benefit of the intentional tort exception, both the government and individual doctors, in order to make that absolutely clear, Congress writes a provision saying that the intentional tort exception shall not apply. Now -- I mean, the position, I have to say, seems to refute itself. If Congress wanted to make absolutely clear that the intentional tort exception would apply, it wouldn't have written a provision saying that it doesn't apply. ",mr feldman mr feldman as i understand your argument and the difference that you have with the government you have one set of difference about the meaning of e but then another set about this question of if it we be true that the government be immune from suit could you bring a tort suit against the doctor and the government say say no and you say yes you might be able to do that but do you have to answer that question at all in order to say that you be correct on e so there be a lot of go back and forth about this question of what would happen if the government we be immune would the individual doctor be immune but that be essentially irrelevant to the question before us be that correct say it a different way i do not have to accept your broad argument i can remain ambivalent about your broader argument and still accept your narrower argument be that correct well let us go back to the text then mr shah as i understand your argument it go something like this this provision be there to to prevent people from draw a mistaken inference and the inference would be that the doctor we be liable because the government be not now there be a thousand way to do that pretty clearly you could just say irrespective of whether the government be liable the doctor be not or some such thing but instead what congress do be it enact a kind of let us pretend provision right let us pretend that the government be liable so then the inference will not arise now that have to be not just not the best way of achieve congress s objective it have to be the bad right because then you be raise the inference that in fact the government be liable why would congress have want to do that I be say something more than that it could not have write it in a bad way but this be not a side issue mr shah in fact you use your understanding of e as an argument to produce the result this court reach in smith so it be it be not a very large issue but it be it be an argument you say you know we should reach the result that you want in smith because e would continue to have this effect it be a supportive argument i be not say that it be the but for argument but it be clearly a supportive argument in your brief mr shah your basic theory of the case which be that in order to make absolutely certain that everyone get the benefit of the intentional tort exception both the government and individual doctor in order to make that absolutely clear congress write a provision say that the intentional tort exception shall not apply now i mean the position i have to say seem to refute itself if congress want to make absolutely clear that the intentional tort exception would apply it would not have write a provision say that it do not apply ,181.91,Roberts Court,"Jan 15, 2013",Steven A.

2013,Executive Benefits Insurance Agency v. Arkison,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, why would we have to do that, Mr. Hallward-Driemeier? Why couldn't we say that this presents a distinct problem, these Stern-type claims, and it's really a problem of severability, and that we should understand this statute in light of Stern as essentially creating this middle category which Congress clearly meant to have the treatment that the noncore claims get. Well, we do try though, again, to apply severability principles to write the statute that Congress would have written if it had known about a constitutional ruling. And that's essentially what Justice Breyer is suggesting. Well, couldn't you say the same thing once again about magistrates, the exact same arguments would apply to them? Well, I don't see why that would make a difference if you say the problem is congressional aggrandizement or congressional encroachment of a certain kind. It doesn't seem to me to make any difference in that case, if Congress says, by the way, you can consent to it. Mr. Gannon-- --Mr. Gannon, could you say a word about the relevance of arbitration here? Because I've been trying to figure out, if there's an Article 3 problem irrespective of consent when Congress adopts some kind of scheme for alternative adjudication, why schemes of mediation and arbitration wouldn't similarly be constitutionally problematic. Yes, but that would suggest that arbitration is more constitutionally problematic because it -- it extends -- you know, it goes -- it's further away from the supervisory authority of the district court. A matter of contract versus a matter of consent? Like I said, you understand the difference.

2013,Daimler AG v. Bauman,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Dupree -- I'm sorry. Please. And, Mr. Dupree, even if you waived that point, if I understand it correctly, you did not waive the point that even with all attribution in the world, there still is no general jurisdiction over Daimler. In other words, you could attribute all MBUSA's contacts and you still would not have general jurisdiction over Daimler; is that right? So in that sense, it really doesn't depend on the attribution standard, all these hard questions of is it an alter ego test or is it an agency test and how does the Constitution relate to State law, because we could apply any test we wanted, and there still wouldn't be general jurisdiction over Daimler in California. Mr. Dupree-- Mr. Kneedler, what do you think about this, that -- you know, as I've been looking through these cases, it seems to me that all these attribution issues and the conflict about attribution arises because courts generally have an improperly broad understanding of general jurisdiction and don't quite understand the distinction between general and specific jurisdiction. If the courts -- if the Court here had understood that general jurisdiction applies when a company is essentially at home in a place, would any of these questions have arisen? But, of course, that just points out the difference between specific and general jurisdiction, that Daimler might be -- might be found -- found it -- there's jurisdiction over Daimler in a case which involves the blowing up of a car in California, but not over something that's not related to any of its contacts in California. Yes, but, Mr. Russell, it's usually -- it doesn't lead to good results when you assume something that is obviously in error. You know, it leads you to go onto a road that you wouldn't otherwise have gone onto and get to a destination that might be improper itself. So it's bad practice, and I understand your, you know, idea about they didn't argue this, they didn't argue that. But to assume something that's obviously a fallacy as your basis for a decision is not likely to lead you to a good outcome. But, Mr. Russell, they did talk about Daimler wasn't subject to general jurisdiction. They didn't contest MBUSA's being subject to general jurisdiction, but they said Daimler isn't subject to general jurisdiction. So, you know, they didn't make the precise argument that they should have made, but they basically put the question at issue: Is Daimler subject to general jurisdiction? Answer: No. Daimler is a German corporation. If it were subject to general jurisdiction in California, so too it would be subject to general jurisdiction in every State in the United States, and all of that has got to be wrong. Mr. Russell, how would you make the argument, and again with Justice Alito, sort of putting these waiver questions aside for a second, a German corporation incorporated in Germany, headquartered in Germany, 2.4 percent of its sales are in California. How do you argue that it's subject to jurisdiction, general jurisdiction, not specific jurisdiction, general jurisdiction, which means over suits that have nothing to do with California or indeed, as here, over in the United States, have anything to do with anything that happened in the United States. How do you make the argument that Daimler is subject to general jurisdiction? It's 2.4 percent of its sales. That would make it subject to general jurisdiction every place. If it is subject to general jurisdiction in California, is it subject to general jurisdiction in all 49 other States? So everybody is subject to general jurisdiction in like California and New York and Florida because they are big markets, but no worries about, you know, Delaware? That's a bad example. Rhode Island. ",mr dupree I be sorry please and mr dupree even if you waive that point if i understand it correctly you do not waive the point that even with all attribution in the world there still be no general jurisdiction over daimler in other word you could attribute all mbusa s contact and you still would not have general jurisdiction over daimler be that right so in that sense it really do not depend on the attribution standard all these hard question of be it an alter ego test or be it an agency test and how do the constitution relate to state law because we could apply any test we want and there still would not be general jurisdiction over daimler in california mr dupree mr kneedler what do you think about this that you know as I have be look through these case it seem to me that all these attribution issue and the conflict about attribution arises because court generally have an improperly broad understanding of general jurisdiction and do not quite understand the distinction between general and specific jurisdiction if the court if the court here have understand that general jurisdiction applies when a company be essentially at home in a place would any of these question have arise but of course that just point out the difference between specific and general jurisdiction that daimler might be might be find found it there be jurisdiction over daimler in a case which involve the blow up of a car in california but not over something that be not relate to any of its contact in california yes but mr russell it be usually it do not lead to good result when you assume something that be obviously in error you know it lead you to go onto a road that you would not otherwise have go onto and get to a destination that might be improper itself so it be bad practice and i understand your you know idea about they do not argue this they do not argue that but to assume something that be obviously a fallacy as your basis for a decision be not likely to lead you to a good outcome but mr russell they do talk about daimler be not subject to general jurisdiction they do not contest mbusa s be subject to general jurisdiction but they say daimler be not subject to general jurisdiction so you know they do not make the precise argument that they should have make but they basically put the question at issue be daimler subject to general jurisdiction answer no daimler be a german corporation if it we be subject to general jurisdiction in california so too it would be subject to general jurisdiction in every state in the united state and all of that have get to be wrong mr russell how would you make the argument and again with justice alito sort of put these waiver question aside for a second a german corporation incorporate in germany headquarter in germany percent of its sale be in california how do you argue that it be subject to jurisdiction general jurisdiction not specific jurisdiction general jurisdiction which mean over suit that have nothing to do with california or indeed as here over in the united state have anything to do with anything that happen in the united state how do you make the argument that daimler be subject to general jurisdiction it be percent of its sale that would make it subject to general jurisdiction every place if it be subject to general jurisdiction in california be it subject to general jurisdiction in all other state so everybody be subject to general jurisdiction in like california and new york and florida because they be big market but no worry about you know delaware that be a bad example rhode island ,226.03,Roberts Court,"Oct 15, 2013",Daimler AG,Barbara Bauman et al.,11-965,"Apr 22, 2013","Jan 14, 2014",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2013,Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community,114,Elena Kagan,"I'm sorry. Could you explain that? Because I thought that the purpose -- that the whole point of the C&L Enterprises case is to say that when a tribe agrees to arbitration, it has waived its sovereign immunity for that purpose in that proceeding. Are you saying that there was something special in this agreement? But I think this is what Justice Kennedy was -- was getting at when he asked you for a case, because what you're saying now is that when the State is the plaintiff-- --the sovereign immunity of the tribe disappears, so-- --Okay. So what -- I guess what's -- what's -- what's the case that would suggest that when the plaintiff shifts the sovereign immunity is -- goes away? General, if -- if I could assume that this is not Indian lands and just ask why you need for sovereign immunity to go away? So you have the ability to arrest people. You have the ability to bring Ex Parte Young actions. Presumably, you have the ability on non-Indian lands simply to shut down a casino. Presumably, you have the ability on non-Indian lands to condition any licensing of the casino on whatever you want. I guess the question is: On non-Indian lands, you have a thousand ways to stop a casino that you don't want. Why do you need the abrogation of sovereign immunity? Well, I think that all of our cases suggest that sovereign immunity is quite important to a sovereign's dignity and that it's not nothing to abrogate sovereign immunity. And so you can say, well, you know, that would be less intrusive than all these other things, bringing Ex Parte Young suits, arresting people, just, you know, conditioning the -- a license, stopping the casino from operating. But, you know, I suspect that the sovereign tribe here would say that, no, it's -- it's an affront to their sovereignty to take -- to strip them of sovereign immunity, and -- and none of these other options that you have are that. Why couldn't this-- --Mr. Katyal, what is the difference -- the State can really -- it can shut down these gambling operations easily if it's off Indian lands. What the State can't do is get any kind of damages or money remedies; isn't that really the difference? Maybe that's an important difference. I mean, maybe we should give the State the ability to collect damages. Well, there seems something sort of strange about that, General, because as I read Kiowa, what it was, was an invitation to Congress. It was saying, you know, we have some concerns about this, we're not sure it makes sense. We are dropping a very broad hint that Congress should change it. And 15 years later, Congress has done nothing. And then to come back 15 years later and to say, you know, Congress didn't really accept our hint, so we'll just do it ourselves and make Congress reverse it, wouldn't you think that that's a strange procedure to use? Or that Congress thought that this did make sense. But I would have thought, General Bursch, that one of the principles behind Indian law in this country goes something like this: Congress can do pretty much whatever it wants with respect to Indian tribes, but we will not likely assume that Congress means to undermine tribal sovereignty. We will -- we will insist that Congress says that before we put it into effect. And here, it's not just -- I mean, Congress has given every indication that it does not wish to change this, notwithstanding our hints that it should. ",I be sorry could you explain that because i think that the purpose that the whole point of the c l enterprise case be to say that when a tribe agree to arbitration it have waive its sovereign immunity for that purpose in that proceeding be you say that there be something special in this agreement but i think this be what justice kennedy be be get at when he ask you for a case because what you be say now be that when the state be the plaintiff the sovereign immunity of the tribe disappear so okay so what i guess what be what be what be the case that would suggest that when the plaintiff shift the sovereign immunity be go away general if if i could assume that this be not indian land and just ask why you need for sovereign immunity to go away so you have the ability to arrest people you have the ability to bring ex parte young action presumably you have the ability on non indian land simply to shut down a casino presumably you have the ability on non indian land to condition any licensing of the casino on whatever you want i guess the question be on non indian land you have a thousand way to stop a casino that you do not want why do you need the abrogation of sovereign immunity well i think that all of our case suggest that sovereign immunity be quite important to a sovereign s dignity and that it be not nothing to abrogate sovereign immunity and so you can say well you know that would be less intrusive than all these other thing bring ex parte young suit arrest people just you know condition the a license stop the casino from operating but you know i suspect that the sovereign tribe here would say that no it be it be an affront to their sovereignty to take to strip them of sovereign immunity and and none of these other option that you have be that why could not this mr katyal what be the difference the state can really it can shut down these gamble operation easily if it be off indian land what the state can not do be get any kind of damage or money remedy be not that really the difference maybe that be an important difference i mean maybe we should give the state the ability to collect damage well there seem something sort of strange about that general because as i read kiowa what it be be an invitation to congress it be say you know we have some concern about this we be not sure it make sense we be drop a very broad hint that congress should change it and year later congress have do nothing and then to come back year later and to say you know congress do not really accept our hint so we will just do it ourselves and make congress reverse it would not you think that that be a strange procedure to use or that congress think that this do make sense but i would have think general bursch that one of the principle behind indian law in this country go something like this congress can do pretty much whatever it want with respect to indian tribe but we will not likely assume that congress mean to undermine tribal sovereignty we will we will insist that congress say that before we put it into effect and here it be not just i mean congress have give every indication that it do not wish to change this notwithstanding our hint that it should ,211.30999999999992,Roberts Court,"Dec 2, 2013",Michigan,Bay Mills Indian Community,12-515,"Jun 24, 2013","May 27, 2014",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2013,Lexmark International v. Static Control Components,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Loy, can I ask you what you think this standing doctrine is all about in a context like this? You said before, you said to give -- to effect Congress's intent in passing Section 43. Is that what we're trying to do here? Well, one of the questions. Why isn't that the only question that we ought to be concerned with in a case like this? Congress creates a right of action and it seems to me that the normal thing that we ought to do and do do in most contexts is just say, you know, What's the scope of that right of action? And -- and certainly we could take into account Congress's purposes in interpreting the scope of that right of action. But that would be the question. I guess, if that's the question the AGC test strikes me as not the answer to that question. I mean, we don't usually say what was Congress's intent, how broad did Congress mean for this cause of action to go, and then sort of devise a five-part test with a lot of things that aren't mentioned in the statute. Mr. -- Mr. Loy, you said there's universal recognition that there should be prudential standing requirements in the Lanham Act. When should there be prudential standing requirements in a statutory right of action? In other words, Congress passes lots of statutory rights of action. And let's say that almost never, never does Congress talk about prudential standing one way or the other. Do you think that every time Congress passes a right of action, the courts are supposed to engage in a kind of free-form inquiry about what kind of prudential standing rule should apply to that particular right of action? And -- and you just sort of know them when you see them or it's a reaction to what are perceived to be very broad statutes or, you know, when -- when do we know that we should be offered a prudential standing jag? But there, couldn't that be done just by interpreting the -- the language of the statue in accord with its purposes, because you have a specific purpose provision in the Lanham Act that says we're -- we're trying to get at commercial competition here. Well, Mr. Jones, is the question that you are asking us to ask just, did Congress want this kind of actor to be able to sue? Is that the question that you think we ought to be asking? Let's not call the limits anything in particular. The question in your view is Congress passes this Act; did Congress -- including this right of action. Did Congress want this kind of actor to be able to use that right of action? Is that correct? But if that's correct, I mean, rather than talking about whether something is arguably within the zone of interests in the way we have to do in the APA context, because we are dealing with a lot of statutes that don't provide rights of action there, why shouldn't we just ask, what kinds of actors did the Lanham Act provide a right of action to as sensibly construed? We should sensibly construe the Lanham Act in accordance with Congress's purposes. And then what would be the test? What would we say the Lanham Act means? What I think, Mr. Jones, just a couple of years ago we made clear that ‶ arguably ″ was to be taken very seriously, and essentially established a kind of buffer zone so that if you kind -- we weren't going to be too strict about it. And the reason we did that, again, is because the way the APA works is it's on top of a lot of Federal statutes that have no rights of action themselves. So there is nothing for us to interpret in those Federal statutes. And we say, well, if you arguably come within the scope of that statute, then you are aggrieved for purposes of the APA. But this is a very different situation. This is a situation where we have a particular right of action. And rather than create any kind of buffer zone around it, we should just ask how is it sensible to interpret that right of action? ",mr loy can i ask you what you think this stand doctrine be all about in a context like this you say before you say to give to effect congress s intent in pass section be that what we be try to do here well one of the question why be not that the only question that we ought to be concern with in a case like this congress create a right of action and it seem to me that the normal thing that we ought to do and do do in most context be just say you know what be the scope of that right of action and and certainly we could take into account congress s purpose in interpret the scope of that right of action but that would be the question i guess if that be the question the agc test strike me as not the answer to that question i mean we do not usually say what be congress s intent how broad do congress mean for this because of action to go and then sort of devise a five part test with a lot of thing that be not mention in the statute mr mr loy you say there be universal recognition that there should be prudential standing requirement in the lanham act when should there be prudential standing requirement in a statutory right of action in other word congress pass lot of statutory right of action and let us say that almost never never do congress talk about prudential stand one way or the other do you think that every time congress pass a right of action the court be suppose to engage in a kind of free form inquiry about what kind of prudential standing rule should apply to that particular right of action and and you just sort of know them when you see them or it be a reaction to what be perceive to be very broad statute or you know when when do we know that we should be offer a prudential standing jag but there could not that be do just by interpret the the language of the statue in accord with its purpose because you have a specific purpose provision in the lanham act that say we be we be try to get at commercial competition here well mr jones be the question that you be ask us to ask just do congress want this kind of actor to be able to sue be that the question that you think we ought to be ask let us not call the limit anything in particular the question in your view be congress pass this act do congress include this right of action do congress want this kind of actor to be able to use that right of action be that correct but if that be correct i mean rather than talk about whether something be arguably within the zone of interest in the way we have to do in the apa context because we be deal with a lot of statute that do not provide right of action there why should not we just ask what kinds of actor do the lanham act provide a right of action to as sensibly construe we should sensibly construe the lanham act in accordance with congress s purpose and then what would be the test what would we say the lanham act mean what i think mr jones just a couple of year ago we make clear that arguably be to be take very seriously and essentially establish a kind of buffer zone so that if you kind we be not go to be too strict about it and the reason we do that again be because the way the apa work be it be on top of a lot of federal statute that have no right of action themselves so there be nothing for us to interpret in those federal statute and we say well if you arguably come within the scope of that statute then you be aggrieve for purpose of the apa but this be a very different situation this be a situation where we have a particular right of action and rather than create any kind of buffer zone around it we should just ask how be it sensible to interpret that right of action ,237.93000000000006,Roberts Court,"Dec 3, 2013","Lexmark International, Inc.","Static Control Components, Inc.",12-873,"Jun 3, 2013","Mar 25, 2014",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2013,BG Group PLC v. Argentina,114,Elena Kagan,"I would be more open about that argument, Ms. Anders, if you had at least suggested how we should go about deciding that question? Because you read this through your brief, and I don't know what a consent-based objection is. In fact, you say consent-based objections can look very, very procedural and it's still consent-based, or it might not be consent-based. So all the techniques that we use in the Howsam-First Options line of cases seem to go out the window and not be replaced with anything else. Mr. Blackman, can I just ask you to assume for a second that that's not so. If you had -- if BG and the Republic of Argentina had itself entered into this agreement, would you agree that this is a typical Howsam kind of provision? Mr. Blackman, could you sort of indulge an assumption for me? And the assumption is that if this provision were in an agreement between two parties, we would treat it as a Howsam-John Wiley kind of provision; in other words, we would say that this is just a procedural rule. That's the side of the line it falls on. So my question to you is: Why should this be any different? You're treating yourself as though you never made an agreement. But, in fact, you did make an important agreement. You made an agreement with the U.K., the entire point and purpose of which was to allow U.K. citizens to bring certain kinds of disputes before an arbitrator. So once we have a U.K. citizen with the right kind of dispute, it seems to me you're just in the position of any other person who's agreed to this provision. And in -- in my assumption, if it's a John Wiley type provision, it should go to an arbitrator. I know. But I said just assume that for me. And tell me why you are in a position where some other result should go into effect. Please.

2013,Town of Greece v. Galloway,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Hungar, I'm wondering what you would think of the following: Suppose that as we began this session of the Court, the Chief Justice had called a minister up to the front of the courtroom, facing the lawyers, maybe the parties, maybe the spectators. And the minister had asked everyone to stand and to bow their heads in prayer and the minister said the following: He said, we acknowledge the saving sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross. We draw strength from His resurrection. Blessed are you who has raised up the Lord Jesus. You who will raise us in our turn and put us by His side. The members of the Court who had stood responded amen, made the sign of the cross, and the Chief Justice then called your case. Would that be permissible? The extension just between the legislature and any other official proceeding; is that correct? Suppose I ask the exact same question, same kinds of statements, same sort of context, except it's not in a courtroom. Instead, it's in a congressional hearing room. Maybe it's a confirmation hearing, maybe it's an investigatory hearing of some kind, and that a person is sitting at a table in front of the members of a committee, ready to testify, ready to give his testimony in support of his nomination. The minister says the exact same thing. Well, why-- --Suppose you are correct, Mr. Hungar, for 11 years the prayers sounded almost exclusively like the ones that I read, and one year on four occasions, there was some attempts to vary it up, to have a Baha'i minister or a -- a Wiccan, but for the most part, not out of any malice or anything like that, but because this is what the people in this community knew and were familiar with and what most of the ministers were, most of the prayers sounded like this. Mr. Gershengorn, do you think that if the legislature -- excuse me -- if the town board here just, you know, started it off with a prayer and then kept on going, do you think that that would be a significantly different case and you would switch sides? Mr. Gershengorn, could you respond to this? Here's what our -- our country promises, our Constitution promises. It's that, however we worship, we're all equal and full citizens. And I think we can all agree on that. And that means that when we approach the government, when we petition the government, we do so not as a Christian, not as a Jew, not as a Muslim, not as a nonbeliever, only as an American. And what troubles me about this case is that here a citizen is going to a local community board, supposed to be the closest, the most responsive institution of government that exists, and is immediately being asked, being forced to identify whether she believes in the things that most of the people in the room believe in, whether she belongs to the same religious idiom as most of the people in the room do. And it strikes me that that might be inconsistent with this understanding that when we relate to our government, we all do so as Americans, and not as Jews and not as Christians and not as nonbelievers. Mr.-- --Mr.-- --Mr. Laycock-- --Mr. Laycock, would you-- --Mr. Laycock, sort of, all hypotheticals aside, isn't the question mostly here in most communities whether the kind of language that I began with, which refers repeatedly to Jesus Christ, which is language that is accepted and admired and incredibly important to the majority members of a community, but is not accepted by a minority, whether that language will be allowed in a public town session like this one. That's really the question, isn't it? That's the issue that actually arises. Here's what -- I don't think that this is an easy question. I think it's hard, because of this. I think it's hard because the Court lays down these rules and everybody thinks that the Court is being hostile to religion and people get unhappy and angry and agitated in various kinds of ways. This goes back to what Justice Breyer suggested. Part of what we are trying to do here is to maintain a multi-religious society in a peaceful and harmonious way. And every time the Court gets involved in things like this, it seems to make the problem worse rather than better. What do you think? ",mr hungar I be wonder what you would think of the following suppose that as we begin this session of the court the chief justice have call a minister up to the front of the courtroom face the lawyer maybe the party maybe the spectator and the minister have ask everyone to stand and to bow their head in prayer and the minister say the following he say we acknowledge the save sacrifice of jesus christ on the cross we draw strength from his resurrection bless be you who have raise up the lord jesus you who will raise us in our turn and put us by his side the member of the court who have stand responded amen make the sign of the cross and the chief justice then call your case would that be permissible the extension just between the legislature and any other official proceeding be that correct suppose i ask the exact same question same kind of statement same sort of context except it be not in a courtroom instead it be in a congressional hearing room maybe it be a confirmation hearing maybe it be an investigatory hearing of some kind and that a person be sit at a table in front of the member of a committee ready to testify ready to give his testimony in support of his nomination the minister say the exact same thing well why suppose you be correct mr hungar for year the prayer sound almost exclusively like the one that i read and one year on four occasion there be some attempt to vary it up to have a baha i minister or a a wiccan but for the most part not out of any malice or anything like that but because this be what the people in this community know and we be familiar with and what most of the minister we be most of the prayer sound like this mr gershengorn do you think that if the legislature excuse me if the town board here just you know start it off with a prayer and then keep on go do you think that that would be a significantly different case and you would switch side mr gershengorn could you respond to this here s what our our country promise our constitution promise it be that however we worship we be all equal and full citizen and i think we can all agree on that and that mean that when we approach the government when we petition the government we do so not as a christian not as a jew not as a muslim not as a nonbeliever only as an american and what trouble me about this case be that here a citizen be go to a local community board suppose to be the close the most responsive institution of government that exist and be immediately be ask be force to identify whether she believe in the thing that most of the people in the room believe in whether she belong to the same religious idiom as most of the people in the room do and it strike me that that might be inconsistent with this understanding that when we relate to our government we all do so as american and not as jew and not as christian and not as nonbeliever mr mr mr laycock mr laycock would you mr laycock sort of all hypothetical aside be not the question mostly here in most community whether the kind of language that i begin with which refer repeatedly to jesus christ which be language that be accept and admire and incredibly important to the majority member of a community but be not accept by a minority whether that language will be allow in a public town session like this one that be really the question be not it that be the issue that actually arise here s what i do not think that this be an easy question i think it be hard because of this i think it be hard because the court lay down these rule and everybody think that the court be be hostile to religion and people get unhappy and angry and agitate in various kind of way this go back to what justice breyer suggest part of what we be try to do here be to maintain a multi religious society in a peaceful and harmonious way and every time the court get involve in thing like this it seem to make the problem worse rather than good what do you think ,275.4,Roberts Court,"Nov 6, 2013","Town of Greece, NY",Susan Galloway et al.,12-696,"May 20, 2013","May 5, 2014",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2013,Fifth Third Bancorp v. Dudenhoeffer,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Long-- --But -- but there are occasions, Mr. Long, outside of that very narrow category of cases that you define in which the stock is going to be way, way, way, overvalued relative to what the fiduciaries know is the company's actual value. Let's just say it -- the -- the market price is four times more than the actual value, and the fiduciaries know that because of inside information that they have. It just sort of defies language to say that some -- a prudent person would retain the investment in that kind of wildly overvalued stock, doesn't it? No. But I'm talking about a case in which the fiduciary has inside information that -- that -- that enables him to know that the stock price is way overvalue in the actual value of the company. Well, I -- I suppose it could, but a prudent manager might say that it would do greater damage to the -- to the participants in the plan to enable this misinformation to exist and to keep putting -- to keep buying stock, to keep putting more and more of their retirement investments into something that is really overvalued. Well, you assume that truthful information will out in the end, and is it better to keep on putting more money into something that is -- is -- you know, is really not a good investment for the participants and the beneficiaries? But even in saying that, Mr. Long, you have a category where you would say the duty of prudence applies, and it's this category of where the company is on the verge of collapse.

2013,Burrage v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, I thought the hypothetical was a bit different. I thought it only takes two drops to kill him. And that's what creates the problem where you don't have but-for causation because you don't know whether you are the extraneous drop or whether you were the drop that actually killed him. So when you use that language of “ substantial factor ”, what you really mean to point to is independent sufficiency? Two people shoot, either one would have killed the person, but you can't say-- --that either is the but-for cause because of the fortuity of the second act? So you don't mean that to go any further than independent sufficiency? I guess here's what the government might say back to you. They might say, you know, in these drug cases, people often take drugs in combination and then they overdose, and it's really impossible for anybody to be able to say what you are requiring an expert to say. In other words, it's impossible to say it was the heroin, not the cocaine, it was the cocaine and not the heroin, it was both, it was neither. It's just -- it's all we can talk about is likelihoods. You know, just as this expert did. They say the fact that he took the heroin made it much more likely that he would die. And that's all we are going to be able to show in a case like that, this, and because of that, we -- that's got to be enough. So Mr.-- --Well, Mr. Horwich, I mean, it seems to me that the dispute before this Court is this: You have somebody who's taken five drugs. One of them is heroin. And the -- the experts get on the stand, and they say: Did the heroin cause the death? And the experts say: Really can't say whether the heroin caused the death in the sense that if the -- if he hadn't taken the heroin, he wouldn't have died. So they say: Well, what can you say? He said: Well, what I can say is that if he hadn't -- is that the heroin made it more likely that he died. Well, how much more likely did the heroin make it? Well, the heroin made it 50 percent more likely that death resulted. Would that be sufficient? Well, take mine. Because I think that that's actually-- --Yes, and he might have died even without the heroin, because all the other substances might have been perfectly adequate to cause death. So I really can't tell you that the heroin played -- even -- you know, even to use your language, I can't tell you whether the heroin contributed. All I can tell you is a likelihood, a probability that the heroin led to death. Well, again, that question of words, the experts were very careful to say: ""I cannot tell you that in the absence of the heroin he wouldn't have died. "" ""He might have died even without the heroin, the experts said. "" ""The only thing I can tell you is that the heroin made it more likely that he died. "" It's a bad sign that you're using the hypotheticals rather than the facts of your case, you know? The facts of your case are that the expert gets on the stand and says: I can't tell you that the heroin was responsible for the death. I cannot tell you that in the absence of the heroin he wouldn't have died. What I can tell you is that the heroin was -- what I can do is to give you essentially a probability that the heroin caused the death. And you're saying that's enough, even if the probability is as small as 50 percent. They said it contributed to the set of drugs, but they didn't say that it contributed to the death. They had no idea whether it contributed to the death. All that they were able to say is: There are five drugs; here are some probabilities; here are some likelihoods. If you don't like the probability language: Here is the likelihood. Using heroin made it more likely that he would die, but we can't say that using heroin killed him. Well, how much more likely does it have to make it that he would die? 50 percent? How about 30 percent? So is that the question? Is -- in other words, is the heroin more likely to have caused the death than the cocaine, than the marijuana, than the sleeping pills? So we can't really say that the heroin caused the death, but it's more likely to have caused the death than anything else he took? Is that the -- is that the question? But -- but maybe not to the death. And is the one question is -- is how this all relates to the “ beyond a reasonable doubt ” instruction in criminal cases? I mean, the idea of a test which focuses in the way yours does on probabilities and likelihoods, and then we go tell the jury, find beyond a reasonable doubt that this was more likely to have caused the death than anything else, or find beyond a reasonable doubt that this increased the likelihood of death by 50 percent. I mean, that seems a very odd kind of question for a jury to consider, but that's exactly what you would be asking a jury to consider. But the statute -- the statute says did it result in death. It did not -- the statute does not say -- does not criminalize a drug that has physiological effects. It criminalizes a drug when it results in death. And you can't say anything about resulting in death except as -- except by reference to probabilities and likelihoods. Mr. Horwich, I just don't understand what “ substantial factor ” means in the way you are using it. I understand what Ms. Campbell said, because she said “ substantial factor ” just means independently sufficient. But you are saying “ substantial factor ” can mean more than that, but it doesn't have to mean a but-for cause. How is something that is a substantial factor in a death without their being able to say that it was a but-for cause of the death? So it's not a substantial factor in causing the death, because that assumes that it actually played a role in causing the death and you can't say whether it played a role in causing the death. That's what creates this problem. In the sense of if it hadn't been there, the death would not have occurred. You can't say that, that's the point. ",well i think the hypothetical be a bit different i think it only take two drop to kill him and that be what create the problem where you do not have but for causation because you do not know whether you be the extraneous drop or whether you we be the drop that actually kill him so when you use that language of substantial factor what you really mean to point to be independent sufficiency two people shoot either one would have kill the person but you can not say that either be the but for because because of the fortuity of the second act so you do not mean that to go any further than independent sufficiency i guess here s what the government might say back to you they might say you know in these drug case people often take drug in combination and then they overdose and it be really impossible for anybody to be able to say what you be require an expert to say in other word it be impossible to say it be the heroin not the cocaine it be the cocaine and not the heroin it be both it be neither it be just it be all we can talk about be likelihood you know just as this expert do they say the fact that he take the heroin make it much more likely that he would die and that be all we be go to be able to show in a case like that this and because of that we that be get to be enough so mr well mr horwich i mean it seem to me that the dispute before this court be this you have somebody who be take five drug one of them be heroin and the the expert get on the stand and they say do the heroin because the death and the expert say really can not say whether the heroin cause the death in the sense that if the if he have not take the heroin he would not have die so they say well what can you say he say well what i can say be that if he have not be that the heroin make it more likely that he die well how much more likely do the heroin make it well the heroin make it percent more likely that death result would that be sufficient well take mine because i think that that be actually yes and he might have die even without the heroin because all the other substance might have be perfectly adequate to because death so i really can not tell you that the heroin play even you know even to use your language i can not tell you whether the heroin contribute all i can tell you be a likelihood a probability that the heroin lead to death well again that question of word the expert we be very careful to say i can not tell you that in the absence of the heroin he would not have died he might have die even without the heroin the expert said the only thing i can tell you be that the heroin make it more likely that he died it be a bad sign that you be use the hypothetical rather than the fact of your case you know the fact of your case be that the expert get on the stand and say i can not tell you that the heroin be responsible for the death i can not tell you that in the absence of the heroin he would not have die what i can tell you be that the heroin be what i can do be to give you essentially a probability that the heroin cause the death and you be say that be enough even if the probability be as small as percent they say it contribute to the set of drug but they do not say that it contribute to the death they have no idea whether it contribute to the death all that they we be able to say be there be five drug here be some probability here be some likelihood if you do not like the probability language here be the likelihood use heroin make it more likely that he would die but we can not say that use heroin kill him well how much more likely do it have to make it that he would die percent how about percent so be that the question be in other word be the heroin more likely to have cause the death than the cocaine than the marijuana than the sleep pill so we can not really say that the heroin cause the death but it be more likely to have cause the death than anything else he take be that the be that the question but but maybe not to the

But the examination that we're talking about is one that the State has compelled and that the Defendant does not wish to undergo. That's a big difference between this case and all the ones you rely on. Not to belabor this, but the -- the holding of the case is that the prosecution may rebut this presentation with evidence from the reports of the examination that the defendant's requested. I mean -- I guess the question is that you say it's a factual difference; it might be a factual difference between compulsion and lack of compulsion. So is that a waiver theory? Because Justice Scalia's opinion was not based on a waiver theory. But my understanding of your brief was that you were arguing about waiver, is that right; that the -- the Defendant here has waived the ability to say that he's being compelled? Well, but if that's policy, why isn't the -- the cross-examination analogy policy as well? I mean, they are both based on some notion of what is parity and what's reciprocity and what's -- you know, what's appropriate to ask the defendant to bear once the defendant decides to become a witness in a proceeding. So they are both the same kind of policy. You want to call it that, but it's -- it's -- one is no more policy than the other. Mr. Katyal, could I go back to the cross-examination analogy. Because you say your case is different, but I think you'll have to explain that one to me. It seems to me that the cross-examination cases say you can't become a witness halfway. Once you've decided to become a witness, you have to subject yourself to all the things that every other witness is subjected to. And it seems to me that you haven't convinced me that the same point isn't true here, that the person, Mr. Cheever, has decided to become a witness essentially by giving an interview to his own expert and allowing his own expert to speak about what Mr. Cheever has told him. And so, you know, he can't do it halfway. Now the government has to get its shot. Same way. ",ms saharsky I be wonder whether you way overread the case that you rely on because in all of those case what we we be talk about be an examination that have specifically request by the defendant now here that be not the case the defendant have ask for something and have open the door conceivably but the examination that we be talk about be one that the state have compel and that the defendant do not wish to undergo that be a big difference between this case and all the one you rely on not to belabor this but the the holding of the case be that the prosecution may rebut this presentation with evidence from the report of the examination that the defendant s request i mean i guess the question be that you say it be a factual difference it might be a factual difference between compulsion and lack of compulsion so be that a waiver theory because justice scalia s opinion be not base on a waiver theory but my understanding of your brief be that you we be argue about waiver be that right that the the defendant here have waive the ability to say that he be be compel well but if that be policy why be not the the cross examination analogy policy as well i mean they be both base on some notion of what be parity and what be reciprocity and what be you know what be appropriate to ask the defendant to bear once the defendant decide to become a witness in a proceeding so they be both the same kind of policy you want to call it that but it be it be one be no more policy than the other mr katyal could i go back to the cross examination analogy because you say your case be different but i think you will have to explain that one to me it seem to me that the cross examination case say you can not become a witness halfway once you have decide to become a witness you have to subject yourself to all the thing that every other witness be subject to and it seem to me that you have not convince me that the same point be not true here that the person mr cheever have decide to become a witness essentially by give an interview to his own expert and allow his own expert to speak about what mr cheever have tell him and so you know he can not do it halfway now the government have to get its shot same way ,135.46,Roberts Court,"Oct 16, 2013",State of Kansas,Scott D.

2013,"Petrella v. MGM, Inc.",114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Bibas, I would have thought that there was something in the copyright context that cuts against you, and that's that because of this separate accrual rule and the feature of these roll-in statutes of limitations combined with very, very lengthy copyrights terms, that essentially a plaintiff can not bring suit for years, decades and time the suit in order to maximize her own gain. That strikes me as something that we don't usually see in statute of limitations cases. I mean, you don't have very many cases where courts have applied laches as against the statute of limitations, but that's because you can't think of many instances in which it would be considered unfair to take the entire statute of limitations to bring a suit. But in this context, you look at something that seems very different. A plaintiff can wait 20 years given the way the separate accrual work -- rule works. We don't make that distinction with respect to equitable tolling. Why would we make it here? ‶ Bizarre ″ seems to me a little strong, because I take it that Mr. Bibas is making a statutory argument -- I mean, he's saying not the language of the statute, but he's saying what was Congress thinking at the time. Congress was faced with all of these precedents, essentially saying laches was not available. There are no cases out there really where laches does cut into a defined statute of limitations period. And then you have the feature that if Congress knew that it was enacting these rolling statutes of limitations, you would have thought that it might have been foremost in their head, how are we going to prevent somebody from suing 30 years later. And they did nothing of the kind. They could very easily have made it clear that laches applied or they could have set an outer limit or they could have done a number of things, and they really didn't do any of them. So how are we to account for all that? The Ninth Circuit here used this language of presumption. It said, ""If any part of the alleged wrongful conduct occurred outside of the limitations period, courts presume that the plaintiff's claims are barred by laches. "" and you just said laches is, at least in part, a prejudice doctrine. Do you concede that that presumption is wrong? Well, that's one -- you know, one understanding of the opinion is, Look, that's just nothing. Do you agree with it? Well, I guess partly that suggests a burden of persuasion, but partly it suggests just a kind of starting position is that if there was conduct outside the limitations period it was prejudicial. And I guess I want to know why that would be. One can agree with that and not think that if conduct happened three years and two days earlier that the burden of coming forward and the necessity to give a reason flips to the other side. Is your argument limited to that? Would you say laches is also available when there's no continuing violation or when there's no rolling period? Mr. Perry, what troubles me a bit about your argument is I think the dearth of cases on this is probably explainable by the fact that people just haven't thought that they had a laches defense when a plaintiff brought a suit within a statute of limitations period. And now, if we open this all up, grant it in a statutory context in which it makes some sense to give people a laches defense, if we open this all up, we'll be seeing motions that nobody ever dreamed of before. ",mr bibas i would have think that there be something in the copyright context that cut against you and that be that because of this separate accrual rule and the feature of these roll in statute of limitation combine with very very lengthy copyright term that essentially a plaintiff can not bring suit for year decade and time the suit in order to maximize her own gain that strike me as something that we do not usually see in statute of limitation case i mean you do not have very many case where court have apply laches as against the statute of limitation but that be because you can not think of many instance in which it would be consider unfair to take the entire statute of limitation to bring a suit but in this context you look at something that seem very different a plaintiff can wait year give the way the separate accrual work rule work we do not make that distinction with respect to equitable tolling why would we make it here bizarre seem to me a little strong because i take it that mr bibas be make a statutory argument i mean he be say not the language of the statute but he be say what be congress thinking at the time congress be face with all of these precedent essentially say laches be not available there be no case out there really where laches do cut into a defined statute of limitation period and then you have the feature that if congress know that it be enact these roll statute of limitation you would have think that it might have be foremost in their head how be we go to prevent somebody from sue year later and they do nothing of the kind they could very easily have make it clear that laches apply or they could have set an out limit or they could have do a number of thing and they really do not do any of them so how be we to account for all that the ninth circuit here use this language of presumption it say if any part of the allege wrongful conduct occur outside of the limitation period court presume that the plaintiff s claim be bar by laches and you just say laches be at least in part a prejudice doctrine do you concede that that presumption be wrong well that be one you know one understanding of the opinion be look that be just nothing do you agree with it well i guess partly that suggest a burden of persuasion but partly it suggest just a kind of start position be that if there be conduct outside the limitation period it be prejudicial and i guess i want to know why that would be one can agree with that and not think that if conduct happen three year and two day earlier that the burden of come forward and the necessity to give a reason flip to the other side be your argument limit to that would you say laches be also available when there be no continue violation or when there be no roll period mr perry what trouble me a bit about your argument be i think the dearth of case on this be probably explainable by the fact that people just have not think that they have a laches defense when a plaintiff bring a suit within a statute of limitation period and now if we open this all up grant it in a statutory context in which it make some sense to give people a laches defense if we open this all up we will be see motion that nobody ever dream of before ,212.94000000000003,Roberts Court,"Jan 21, 2014",Paula Petrella,"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc., et al.",12-1315,"Oct 1, 2013","May 19, 2014",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2013,Hall v. Florida,114,Elena Kagan,"Mister-- --Mr. Waxman, can I take you back to a question that the Chief Justice asked? Because the Chief Justice said, you know, where does this SEM come from. And it is the test maker's determination that this is the margin of error that gives you a 95 percent confidence. I guess the question here or one question here is why do we have a 95 percent -- why do we need a 95 percent confidence level? And you could say it either way. You could say, gosh, we're putting somebody to death, we should -- we should have a 100 percent confidence level. Or you could say, as I take it Justice Alito -- Justice Alito's point was, well, look, the burden of proof is on the defendant here anyway, so a 95 percent confidence level seems awfully high. We should, you know, ration it down to 80 percent. So why for this purpose do we have to go with the test maker's determination that 5 is what gives you a 95 percent confidence level? Well -- and that's not really my question. I understand why they might use it for a wide variety of purposes. The question is: Why does their determination that it's useful for a wide variety of purposes to have a 95 percent confidence level, why is the State stuck with that for this purpose? So what-- --But, General, the ultimate determination here is whether somebody is mentally retarded; and the IQ test is just a part of that. It's a part of one prong of that ultimate determination. And what your cutoff does is it essentially says the inquiry has to stop there. And the question is how is that at all consistent with anything we ever say when it comes to the death penalty? Because we have this whole line of cases that says when it comes to meting out the death penalty, we actually do individualized consideration, and we allow people to make their best case about why they're not eligible for the death penalty. And essentially what your cutoff does is it stops that in its tracks, as to a person who may or may not even have a true IQ of over 70, and let alone it stops people in their tracks who may not be mentally -- who may be mentally retarded. But he doesn't have it with respect to this critical question, right? We've said you cannot execute somebody who is mentally retarded; and he says now you are preventing me from showing you that you're mentally retarded, because you have an IQ test, a part of one prong of the three-prong test, you have an IQ test that says that I'm not mentally retarded, but you know, that IQ test may be wrong. It's not -- given that you are not using a margin of error. But, General, at the very least, you give somebody an IQ test, he scores a 71. Now, he might actually have an IQ of 71, or we know from the way these standard margins of error work, he might have an IQ of 69, and you won't let him go to the adaptive behavior prong of the test and show that, you know, and -- and show that he can't function in society in the ways that Atkins seems to care about, as Justice Kennedy says, notwithstanding that this IQ score number might be accurate or might not be. General. Could the State change its statute to say we're -- we're now using a threshold of 60? Well, I guess I don't understand it. You have to explain that to me a little bit. Because I thought that the 70 was -- is very longstanding. Everybody has agreed that it's -- it's 70 for many, many decades. Maybe -- maybe forever. So how could a State -- if the State -- why could the State say no to that? What would you look at? General, can I just ask-- --why you have this policy? Why you have the policy. I mean, is it administrative convenience? Just tell me why you have the policy. No, no, no. Why you have the 70 threshold. Well, that's just to say that it would double the number of people eligible, but some of them may be mentally retarded. I mean, presumably we want accurate decisionmaking with respect to this question, don't we? Who are not mentally retarded if they don't have an IQ score of 70 or below? I mean, you -- you don't believe that yourself, right? This is a tool to decide whether somebody is mentally retarded, and it's a tool that functions in one prong of a three-prong test. ",mister mr waxman can i take you back to a question that the chief justice ask because the chief justice say you know where do this sem come from and it be the test maker s determination that this be the margin of error that give you a percent confidence i guess the question here or one question here be why do we have a percent why do we need a percent confidence level and you could say it either way you could say gosh we be put somebody to death we should we should have a percent confidence level or you could say as i take it justice alito justice alito s point be well look the burden of proof be on the defendant here anyway so a percent confidence level seem awfully high we should you know ration it down to percent so why for this purpose do we have to go with the test maker s determination that be what give you a percent confidence level well and that be not really my question i understand why they might use it for a wide variety of purpose the question be why do their determination that it be useful for a wide variety of purpose to have a percent confidence level why be the state stuck with that for this purpose so what but general the ultimate determination here be whether somebody be mentally retarded and the iq test be just a part of that it be a part of one prong of that ultimate determination and what your cutoff do be it essentially say the inquiry have to stop there and the question be how be that at all consistent with anything we ever say when it come to the death penalty because we have this whole line of case that say when it come to meting out the death penalty we actually do individualized consideration and we allow people to make their best case about why they be not eligible for the death penalty and essentially what your cutoff do be it stop that in its track as to a person who may or may not even have a true iq of over and let alone it stops people in their track who may not be mentally who may be mentally retarded but he do not have it with respect to this critical question right we have say you can not execute somebody who be mentally retarded and he say now you be prevent me from show you that you be mentally retarded because you have an iq test a part of one prong of the three prong test you have an iq test that say that I be not mentally retarded but you know that iq test may be wrong it be not give that you be not use a margin of error but general at the very least you give somebody an iq test he score a now he might actually have an iq of or we know from the way these standard margin of error work he might have an iq of and you will not let him go to the adaptive behavior prong of the test and show that you know and and show that he can not function in society in the way that atkins seem to care about as justice kennedy say notwithstanding that this iq score number might be accurate or might not be general could the state change its statute to say we be we be now use a threshold of well i guess i do not understand it you have to explain that to me a little bit because i think that the be be very longstanding everybody have agree that it be it have for many many decade maybe maybe forever so how could a state if the state why could the state say no to that what would you look at general can i just ask why you have this policy why you have the policy i mean be it administrative convenience just tell me why you have the policy no no no why you have the threshold well that be just to say that it would double the number of people eligible but some of them may be mentally retarded i mean presumably we want accurate decisionmaking with respect to this question do not we who be not mentally retard if they do not have an iq score of or below i mean you you do not believe that yourself right this be a tool to decide whether somebody be mentally retarded and it be a tool that function in one prong of a three prong test ,260.62000000000006,Roberts Court,"Mar 3, 2014",Freddie Lee Hall,Florida,12-10882,"Oct 21, 2013","May 27, 2014",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2013,Rosemond v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"Isn't criminal law -- isn't criminal law replete with crimes which have lesser included offenses as part of them? So wouldn't your rule be a very difficult one to apply because it would suggest that the person had to facilitate some part of the crime that was not a part of a lesser included offense? Well, Mr. Bash, what about this case? Suppose that there are two guys and they are talking about committing a crime, and they have the same kind of conversation that Justice Alito was referencing, you know, one guy says I want to bring a gun, the other says, no, I think that's a really bad idea. But this time, the guy says: Okay, you've convinced me, it's a bad idea to bring a gun, I won't bring a gun. And so then they go out and they rob whatever they are robbing, and in the middle of it, you know -- or they do a drug transaction, and in the middle of that drug transaction the guy who said don't bring a gun looks over and he realizes that, notwithstanding the promise, his confederate did bring a gun. But there they are, they are in the middle of their drug transaction. So the guy, you know, they're right -- they are handing the money to each other and the guy keeps on doing it, all right? Is -- is that enough, even though, you know, there's foreknowledge, there's acts after he -- he realizes that the guy has a gun? Is that sufficient? Well, what exactly would you want him to do at that point to not be convicted of this, of this offense? Would you want him to just say, you know, sort of like drop everything, I'm out of there? Is that the idea? Right. I mean, I guess that's the question: Is there always a reasonable opportunity to withdraw after you see that there's a gun in the offense that you didn't expect to be there? And do you think that there has to be a reasonable opportunity to withdraw, or would you say, no, everybody has a reasonable opportunity to withdraw all the time; you can just leave? Mr. Bash, you know, what sticks in my craw a little bit about your position is this: Usually, we want punishments to -- two people and they do very different things and they have very different intents, we want them actually to be punished differently. And what you're suggesting is that there is -- let's say a crime, two people are involved in it. One person does almost everything. You know, he does 90 percent of the stuff. And the other person does just a little thing, but something, you know, that goes to the offense that helps facilitate the offense. But it's really pretty small compared to the overall crime. And then in addition to that, that person does not have really full-fledged intent, just has a kind of knowledge that this other person with real purpose of intent is going to bring a gun. So -- so, you have a lesser act and a lesser intent, and notwithstanding that, you're saying that the person ought to be punished in the exact same way as his confederate. But I just add, what I would have thought was that the actus reus can be very small, but almost to compensate for that, you have to have full-fledged intent. You have to have a really kind of purpose of -- a -- a purpose that the crime succeed as opposed to just knowledge of -- of what will happen. ",be not criminal law be not criminal law replete with crime which have less include offense as part of them so would not your rule be a very difficult one to apply because it would suggest that the person have to facilitate some part of the crime that be not a part of a lesser include offense well mr bash what about this case suppose that there be two guy and they be talk about commit a crime and they have the same kind of conversation that justice alito be reference you know one guy say i want to bring a gun the other say no i think that be a really bad idea but this time the guy say okay you have convince me it be a bad idea to bring a gun i will not bring a gun and so then they go out and they rob whatever they be rob and in the middle of it you know or they do a drug transaction and in the middle of that drug transaction the guy who say do not bring a gun look over and he realize that notwithstanding the promise his confederate do bring a gun but there they be they be in the middle of their drug transaction so the guy you know they be right they be hand the money to each other and the guy keep on do it all right be be that enough even though you know there be foreknowledge there have act after he he realize that the guy have a gun be that sufficient well what exactly would you want him to do at that point to not be convict of this of this offense would you want him to just say you know sort of like drop everything I be out of there be that the idea right i mean i guess that be the question be there always a reasonable opportunity to withdraw after you see that there be a gun in the offense that you do not expect to be there and do you think that there have to be a reasonable opportunity to withdraw or would you say no everybody have a reasonable opportunity to withdraw all the time you can just leave mr bash you know what stick in my craw a little bit about your position be this usually we want punishment to two people and they do very different thing and they have very different intent we want them actually to be punish differently and what you be suggest be that there be let us say a crime two people be involve in it one person do almost everything you know he do percent of the stuff and the other person do just a little thing but something you know that go to the offense that help facilitate the offense but it be really pretty small compare to the overall crime and then in addition to that that person do not have really full fledge intent just have a kind of knowledge that this other person with real purpose of intent be go to bring a gun so so you have a less act and a less intent and notwithstanding that you be say that the person ought to be punish in the exact same way as his confederate but i just add what i would have think be that the actus reus can be very small but almost to compensate for that you have to have full fledge intent you have to have a really kind of purpose of a a purpose that the crime succeed as oppose to just knowledge of of what will happen ,203.85,Roberts Court,"Nov 12, 2013",Justus C.

2013,White v. Woodall,114,Elena Kagan,"Ms. Lenz, could I ask you about what you just said? You said Carter, Estelle, and Mitchell; those are the three. So Carter says the Fifth Amendment requires that a criminal trial judge must give a no-adverse-inference jury instruction when requested by a defendant. And that was, of course, not a sentencing case. Then Estelle says, we discern no basis to distinguish between the guilt and penalty phases of Respondent's capital murder trial so far as the protection of the Fifth Amendment; so a kind of general view that the Fifth Amendment applies equally in the two. And then Mitchell holds -- it basically repeats that from Estelle and says, we must accord the privilege the same protection in the sentencing phase of any criminal case, as that which is due in the trial phase. So when you put those together, Carter with Estelle, Mitchell, how -- why do you think that there's a gap? But take the -- take the hypothetical, Ms. Lenz, that suppose, you know, the prosecutor had said you just heard testimony from our expert that -- the blood spattering expert, that the victim's suffering was especially prolonged, and look, the defendant didn't take the stand. Why didn't he take the stand to deny that? All right? So could the prosecutor have said that at the sentencing hearing? So you're suggesting that what we haven't decided, if you will, goes beyond the remorse question of -- that we -- that we talked about in -- not Mitchell, but -- is it Mitchell? It goes beyond the remorse question. And you're saying that really, in the sentencing hearing, the Fifth Amendment has nothing to do with -- with anything that happens there essentially, because once -- once the person has been found eligible for the death penalty, a prosecutor and a jury can -- can draw whatever inferences they want. Well, where does that difference come from? Because I thought that every time and in every circumstance that we've prohibited an adverse inference we've also required a requested jury instruction. I don't know of a -- of a case or any principle that would suggest that we can tear those two things apart and say, well, look, an adverse inference is prohibited, but, no, you don't get an instruction. I guess I'm asking a different question. Do you have any case that suggests that those two things don't go hand and hand? Because my -- my sort of reading of our case law is that they do. Any time we've said an adverse inference is prohibited, we've also said the defendant is titled -- is entitled to an instruction about adverse inferences if he requests it. But in not making that distinction, I mean, it does speak very broadly, and it says, you know -- I'm reading another quotation from it. ""The rule against negative inferences at a criminal trial apply with equal force at sentencing. "" Now, it does have this exception for remorse or a possible exception for remorse. But with that exception, otherwise, it says the rule against adverse inferences applies, doesn't it? I think my question was just the breadth of these statements about everything that applies at trial with respect to adverse inferences also applies at the sentencing phase, with the possible exception of adverse inferences about remorse. That's the way I read the cases. Well, Estelle might not have been overruled, but there's a caveat that Mitchell puts in, and it's a caveat about remorse and that remorse might be different. And the question is why doesn't that caveat suggest, at the very least, that the instruction that you asked for was so broad that it went beyond what this Court has decided. Because the instruction that you asked for did not distinguish remorse from other issues that were going to come before the jury at the sentencing phase. So at the very least it seems that instruction sort of blows by the question that we have reserved. I'm sorry. So how was it an issue at the hearing? Because that would seem to cut against you very strongly, Mr. Komp. If remorse is an issue at the hearing, remorse is the very thing that in Mitchell we said we have not decided. And then you have no clearly established law to rely on. And I appreciate that this was before Mitchell rather than after Mitchell; but it suggests that there was always a question about whether Estelle applied to remorse. Mr. Komp, did the Sixth Circuit apply the wrong harmlessness standard here? It seemed to a apply the standard that would be applicable on direct review rather than on habeas review; is that correct? Because it seems to rely primarily on Carter. And Carter applies the Chapman standard, which is of course the direct review standard. ",ms lenz could i ask you about what you just say you say carter estelle and mitchell those be the three so carter say the fifth amendment require that a criminal trial judge must give a no adverse inference jury instruction when request by a defendant and that be of course not a sentencing case then estelle say we discern no basis to distinguish between the guilt and penalty phase of respondent s capital murder trial so far as the protection of the fifth amendment so a kind of general view that the fifth amendment applies equally in the two and then mitchell hold it basically repeat that from estelle and say we must accord the privilege the same protection in the sentence phase of any criminal case as that which be due in the trial phase so when you put those together carter with estelle mitchell how why do you think that there be a gap but take the take the hypothetical ms lenz that suppose you know the prosecutor have say you just hear testimony from our expert that the blood spatter expert that the victim s suffering be especially prolong and look the defendant do not take the stand why do not he take the stand to deny that all right so could the prosecutor have say that at the sentence hearing so you be suggest that what we have not decide if you will go beyond the remorse question of that we that we talk about in not mitchell but be it mitchell it go beyond the remorse question and you be say that really in the sentencing hearing the fifth amendment have nothing to do with with anything that happen there essentially because once once the person have be find eligible for the death penalty a prosecutor and a jury can can draw whatever inference they want well where do that difference come from because i think that every time and in every circumstance that we have prohibit an adverse inference we have also require a requested jury instruction i do not know of a of a case or any principle that would suggest that we can tear those two thing apart and say well look an adverse inference be prohibit but no you do not get an instruction i guess I be ask a different question do you have any case that suggest that those two thing do not go hand and hand because my my sort of reading of our case law be that they do any time we have say an adverse inference be prohibit we have also say the defendant be title be entitle to an instruction about adverse inference if he request it but in not make that distinction i mean it do speak very broadly and it say you know I be read another quotation from it the rule against negative inference at a criminal trial apply with equal force at sentencing now it do have this exception for remorse or a possible exception for remorse but with that exception otherwise it say the rule against adverse inference applies do not it i think my question be just the breadth of these statement about everything that apply at trial with respect to adverse inference also apply at the sentence phase with the possible exception of adverse inference about remorse that be the way i read the case well estelle might not have be overrule but there be a caveat that mitchell put in and it be a caveat about remorse and that remorse might be different and the question be why do not that caveat suggest at the very least that the instruction that you ask for be so broad that it go beyond what this court have decide because the instruction that you ask for do not distinguish remorse from other issue that we be go to come before the jury at the sentence phase so at the very least it seem that instruction sort of blow by the question that we have reserve I be sorry so how be it an issue at the hearing because that would seem to cut against you very strongly mr komp if remorse be an issue at the hearing remorse be the very thing that in mitchell we say we have not decide and then you have no clearly establish law to rely on and i appreciate that this be before mitchell rather than after mitchell but it suggest that there be always a question about whether estelle apply to remorse mr komp do the sixth circuit apply the wrong harmlessness standard here it seem to a apply the standard that would be applicable on direct review rather than on habeas review be that correct because it seem to rely primarily on carter and carter applies the chapman standard which be of course the direct review standard ,295.05999999999995,Roberts Court,"Dec 11, 2013","Randy White, Warden",Robert Keith Woodall,12-794,"Jun 27, 2013","Apr 23, 2014",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

In other words, if -- if Aereo has the hardware in its warehouse as opposed to Aereo selling the hardware to the particular end user, that is going to make all the difference in the world as to whether we have a public performance or not a public performance. So you think that in my hypo, there's a performance, but it's a private performance and then you move the hardware and it becomes a public performance. Is that it? But what if, Mr. Clement, it's not so simple as a company that just allows you yourself to put something up there? What if -- how about there are lots of companies where many, many thousands or millions of people put things up there, and then they share them, and the company in some ways aggregates and sorts all that content. Does that count? Can I ask my same question to you that I asked to Mr. Clement? How about if there's a company that allows sharing and that aggregates all the content that different individual users put up and that in some sense sort of sorts and classifies the content in different ways? How about that? But, Mr. Frederick, it's also -- it's also no different from -- from a user's perspective, it's exactly the same as if I'm watching cable. Right? You just have a different content selection, but it looks the same to you. Somebody else is providing you with a menu, and then you pick off that menu. Mr. Frederick, why isn't it sufficient to create a line such as the one Mr. Clement said, which said, you know, do you on the one hand supply or provide the content, that puts you in one box; on the other hand, if you are not supplying or providing the content, if the user is supplying and providing the content, and you are just providing the space, a kind of platform for them to do that and for them potentially to share the content, that puts you in another box? ",well that be something else before you get to justice sotomayor s second half of the question but something more along the line of provide hardware suppose a company just give the antenna and a hard drive that be what they sell to the user and the user be able to use the antenna and the hard drive in her own house or apartment in order to get all these broadcast program what would the would that be a performance but then it really do depend on like where the where the hardware be in other word if if aereo have the hardware in its warehouse as oppose to aereo sell the hardware to the particular end user that be go to make all the difference in the world as to whether we have a public performance or not a public performance so you think that in my hypo there be a performance but it be a private performance and then you move the hardware and it become a public performance be that it but what if mr clement it be not so simple as a company that just allow you yourself to put something up there what if how about there be lot of company where many many thousand or million of people put thing up there and then they share them and the company in some way aggregate and sort all that content do that count can i ask my same question to you that i ask to mr clement how about if there be a company that allow share and that aggregate all the content that different individual user put up and that in some sense sort of sort and classify the content in different way how about that but mr frederick it be also it be also no different from from a user s perspective it be exactly the same as if I be watch cable right you just have a different content selection but it look the same to you somebody else be provide you with a menu and then you pick off that menu mr frederick why be not it sufficient to create a line such as the one mr clement say which say you know do you on the one hand supply or provide the content that put you in one box on the other hand if you be not supply or provide the content if the user be supply and provide the content and you be just provide the space a kind of platform for them to do that and for them potentially to share the content that put you in another box ,130.11,Roberts Court,"Apr 22, 2014","American Broadcasting Corporation, Inc., et al.","Aereo, Inc.",13-461,"Jan 10, 2014","Jun 25, 2014",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2013,Loughrin v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"One understanding of what led to this statute is this Court's decision in Maze, which actually seems on all fours with this case, right? Use of a fraudulent credit card to a merchant who then asks for money from the bank. Essentially the same case as this with a fraudulent credit card as opposed to a fraudulent check. So if we understand this statute as arising from Congress's desire to make that bank fraud, why should we rule for you here? What's the theory behind that? Why would presenting an altered check to a third party constitute sufficient evidence of intent to defraud a bank? But, Mr. Yang, your interpretation of the statute goes far beyond Maze. Maze was something with a fraudulent credit card or forged check or something like that, but if I understand your interpretation of the statute, you know, if I sell a painting to somebody and I represent it to be by a famous artist and in fact I've just made it in my kitchen, and that person pays me with a check and it's a perfectly valid check, it's a good check, the fraud is obviously as to the person who's just bought the painting. It has nothing to do with the bank. But your interpretation would cover that case as well. And it's just a little bit peculiar, right? I mean, if somebody pays me in cash, the government can't prosecute the person. If somebody pulls out a check, the government can, but that doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense in terms of what the statute is about. And what does that mean, Mr. Yang? I mean, it could mean that the -- that the defendant intends that the money come from the bank, or you could mean that the defendant intends to obtain money which he knows may or is reasonably likely to or is foreseeable to come from the bank. Which do you mean? Well, I think this does go back to Justice Alito's question, because the person can say -- the defendant here could have said, I really don't care whether the bank ends up paying Target. I don't know whether the bank will end up paying Target. I don't know how these things work and how often the bank honors it and how often the bank doesn't honor it. And I really could not care less as long as I get my money from Target. No, but -- so you're saying that my person -- forget the other examples. I mean, you're saying that this person who could not care less if the money comes from the bank and actually thinks that the money may not come from the bank because it's quite likely that the bank is not going to honor this, you think, nonetheless, that that person has intended to obtain bank property? Can I just make sure I -- I understand your -- your answer to my question. Suppose that this defendant did not return the merchandise for cash. In other words, suppose he just wanted an Xbox and he did the exact same thing. So he never himself wanted cash and, again, could not have cared at all whether the bank was going to give the vendor cash. Still, you would say that person intended to obtain bank property? Mr. Yang, your first order argument, which is, you know, the natural way one would read a statute that says ‶ (1) of (2) ″, is to interpret it as meaning two different things. But that requires us to read it differently from the way we read the exact same words, without the numbers, but the exact same words in McNally. And we know that Congress wanted the bank fraud statutes to mirror the mail and wire fraud statutes. So we end up with this -- you know, if we -- if we go with your friend over there, we read a statute in a way we wouldn't normally. But if we go with you, we have to read these two statutes that say the same thing and that we know Congress meant to say the same thing differently. Well, how can that intent difference be significant? I mean, I would have thought that you would said the same proof that goes to whether you intend to obtain bank property, even though you're presenting this check only to a third party, and the check may or may not be honored by the bank. You could say the exact same thing about whether you intend to defraud the bank. Well, why isn't that the same under the intent to obtain bank property? Where you also, the defendant, might say: No, I really didn't intend to obtain property, because I didn't really know whether the bank would honor the check and, in fact, I thought it wouldn't. But even on the obtain property lane, it's obtain property from the bank, isn't it? Well, in the custody of the bank? No, but in a case like this, wouldn't the difficulties of proof be the same? The person -- whether you charge somebody with trying to defraud the bank or with trying to obtain property owned by or in the custody of the bank. If Justice Alito is right as to the one, that all these questions about the relationship between a bank and a retailer are going to come in, isn't he also right as to the other? ",one understanding of what lead to this statute be this court s decision in maze which actually seem on all four with this case right use of a fraudulent credit card to a merchant who then ask for money from the bank essentially the same case as this with a fraudulent credit card as oppose to a fraudulent check so if we understand this statute as arise from congress s desire to make that bank fraud why should we rule for you here what be the theory behind that why would present an altered check to a third party constitute sufficient evidence of intent to defraud a bank but mr yang your interpretation of the statute go far beyond maze maze be something with a fraudulent credit card or forge check or something like that but if i understand your interpretation of the statute you know if i sell a painting to somebody and i represent it to be by a famous artist and in fact I have just make it in my kitchen and that person pay me with a check and it be a perfectly valid check it be a good check the fraud be obviously as to the person who be just buy the painting it have nothing to do with the bank but your interpretation would cover that case as well and it be just a little bit peculiar right i mean if somebody pay me in cash the government can not prosecute the person if somebody pull out a check the government can but that do not seem to make a whole lot of sense in term of what the statute be about and what do that mean mr yang i mean it could mean that the that the defendant intend that the money come from the bank or you could mean that the defendant intend to obtain money which he know may or be reasonably likely to or be foreseeable to come from the bank which do you mean well i think this do go back to justice alito s question because the person can say the defendant here could have say i really do not care whether the bank end up pay target i do not know whether the bank will end up pay target i do not know how these thing work and how often the bank honor it and how often the bank do not honor it and i really could not care less as long as i get my money from target no but so you be say that my person forget the other example i mean you be say that this person who could not care less if the money come from the bank and actually think that the money may not come from the bank because it be quite likely that the bank be not go to honor this you think nonetheless that that person have intend to obtain bank property can i just make sure i i understand your your answer to my question suppose that this defendant do not return the merchandise for cash in other word suppose he just want an xbox and he do the exact same thing so he never himself want cash and again could not have care at all whether the bank be go to give the vendor cash still you would say that person intend to obtain bank property mr yang your first order argument which be you know the natural way one would read a statute that say of be to interpret it as mean two different thing but that require us to read it differently from the way we read the exact same word without the number but the exact same word in mcnally and we know that congress want the bank fraud statutes to mirror the mail and wire fraud statute so we end up with this you know if we if we go with your friend over there we read a statute in a way we would not normally but if we go with you we have to read these two statute that say the same thing and that we know congress meant to say the same thing differently well how can that intent difference be significant i mean i would have think that you would say the same proof that go to whether you intend to obtain bank property even though you be present this check only to a third party and the check may or may not be honor by the bank you could say the exact same thing about whether you intend to defraud the bank well why be not that the same under the intent to obtain bank property where you also the defendant might say no i really do not intend to obtain property because i do not really know whether the bank would honor the check and in fact i think it would not but even on the obtain property lane it be obtain property from the bank be not it well in the custody of the bank no but in a case like this would not the difficulty of proof be the same the person whether you charge somebody with try to defraud the bank or with try to obtain property own by or in the custody of the bank if justice alito be right as to the one that all these question about the relationship between a bank and a retailer be go to come in be not he also right as to the other ,284.1500000000001,Roberts Court,"Apr 1, 2014",Kevin Loughrin,United States,13-316,"Dec 13, 2013","Jun 23, 2014",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1

2013,Abramski v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"I'm sorry. So you're saying that in that case, the gun dealer runs the background check on the person who hands the gun dealer the credit card as opposed to the person who will be the actual recipient of the gun? Is that what you're saying the statute requires? Mr. Dietz, can we go back to the question that Justice Alito raised. The primary object of this statute is to keep guns out of hands of felons, of people with mental illness and so forth. Now, it's absolutely true, as you have said, that Congress didn't do everything it could have to achieve that result, right? That there are many kinds of resales that are allowable, that there are gifts that are allowable. It's one thing to say that. It's another thing to say that at the initial point of sale, which is where the entire system is set up, right, with the gun dealer doing the automatic checks, that at that initial point of sale, which is the centerpiece of this statute, that we will -- that we will essentially disregard fronts, that we -- you know, that we don't care that the person standing at the counter is a front. I mean, that goes far beyond the other kinds of resale possibilities that you're talking about. And I guess what I want to know is why you think a Congress that was geared towards this object of keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous people and set up a mechanism that had the gun seller be the kind of enforcer, at the point of sale, would have thought, oh, it's fine if a front, if a straw walks in the door. Well, Mr. Palmore, is that right? I thought that Mr. Dietz's argument went beyond what Justice Scalia just said, that for Mr. Dietz, regarding -- you can -- he might be prosecuted under another statute for selling something to somebody he knows is Al Capone, but that he was -- you know, because he was the guy at the counter and he was buying for somebody else, as to this question of material representation, it does not matter whether the ultimate transferee was Al Capone or somebody else. I think he said that just right in here. If you're right on Question 1, 922(t) just makes this a slam dunk on Question 2. And there's a question about whether you are right on Question 1. But if you are, (t) says, look, the dealer is supposed to check the transferee, right? And if we assume that when Congress says ""the transferee"", it's the real transferee, not the fake transferee, the dealer is supposed to check the real transferee. So what does the dealer think is material? I mean, the question is: What does a reasonable dealer think is material? I better know who you are so I can check you. That's material. Well, it's not just the structure -- it's not just the overriding purpose. 922(t) says that the dealer is supposed to check the transferee to find out whether the transferee has a criminal record, to find out whether the transferee has mental illness. So who does he check? Who is the transferee? Well, I need to know who the transferee is to make that check. So, obviously, it's material to know who the transferee is. ",I be sorry so you be say that in that case the gun dealer run the background check on the person who hand the gun dealer the credit card as oppose to the person who will be the actual recipient of the gun be that what you be say the statute require mr dietz can we go back to the question that justice alito raise the primary object of this statute be to keep gun out of hand of felon of people with mental illness and so forth now it be absolutely true as you have say that congress do not do everything it could have to achieve that result right that there be many kind of resale that be allowable that there be gift that be allowable it be one thing to say that it be another thing to say that at the initial point of sale which be where the entire system be set up right with the gun dealer do the automatic check that at that initial point of sale which be the centerpiece of this statute that we will that we will essentially disregard front that we you know that we do not care that the person stand at the counter be a front i mean that go far beyond the other kind of resale possibility that you be talk about and i guess what i want to know be why you think a congress that be gear towards this object of keep gun out of the hand of dangerous people and set up a mechanism that have the gun seller be the kind of enforcer at the point of sale would have think oh it be fine if a front if a straw walk in the door well mr palmore be that right i think that mr dietz s argument go beyond what justice scalia just say that for mr dietz regard you can he might be prosecute under another statute for sell something to somebody he know be al capone but that he be you know because he be the guy at the counter and he be buy for somebody else as to this question of material representation it do not matter whether the ultimate transferee be al capone or somebody else i think he say that just right in here if you be right on question t just make this a slam dunk on question and there be a question about whether you be right on question but if you be t say look the dealer be suppose to check the transferee right and if we assume that when congress say the transferee it be the real transferee not the fake transferee the dealer be suppose to check the real transferee so what do the dealer think be material i mean the question be what do a reasonable dealer think be material i well know who you be so i can check you that be material well it be not just the structure it be not just the override purpose t say that the dealer be suppose to check the transferee to find out whether the transferee have a criminal record to find out whether the transferee have mental illness so who do he check who be the transferee well i need to know who the transferee be to make that check so obviously it be material to know who the transferee be ,199.04,Roberts Court,"Jan 22, 2014",Bruce J.

2013,Wood v. Moss,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, do you agree with that, Mr. Gershengorn? Because you have these hypotheticals in the last page of your brief where you say that a complaint could survive a motion to dismiss if the Secret Service members had, you know, announced, had admitted that they had an intention to discriminate or if they had told the local police that. So I took what you were saying there to say, if there is evidence of a very clear nature, that it was all about animus and it was nothing about security, then the complaint would survive. Mr. Gershengorn, suppose that we changed the facts here and that both the pro-Bush demonstrators and the anti-Bush demonstrators were in the same place and they were at the foot of the alleyway, so that there was an objective security rationale, but that the Secret Service members -- and they were in all respects the same except that they had different signs. Some signs say the President is great and some signs say the President is terrible. And the Secret Service members had only removed the ones with the signs that said the President is terrible. So what would your analysis of that be, both under the clearly established, but also, I want you to get to what you think the law is there. I think you're changing my hypothetical, or let me just explain my hypothetical. I put them both at the foot of the alleyway because that meant that both have a straight shot, you know, that they can throw a grenade into the patio, which is, I take it, what the nature of your objective security consideration is. So that's true of both of them. But you only move the ones that say the President is terrible. But just -- just tell me what your answer to that case is. What do you think-- --And do you think it would be unlawful? Forget clearly established. I said both can throw a grenade into the patio area, but in fact you only remove the people who have the anti-President sign-- --notwithstanding that the security consideration applies to both equally. No, that is. I mean, suppose I add to my hypothetical and I say -- and the Secret Service goes to the local police and says -- and, you know, doesn't talk about grenades at all and really just says we have got to get these anti-President people out of here because they're annoying the President; let's do it right now, and that's what they do. Well, there is one. I mean, there is one in a sense of as we look back, we can see that there's an alleyway and that somebody could have a grenade, but there is evidence that that's not at all what was in the heads of the Secret Service members. Mr. Wilker, do you concede that, looking on this just in a hindsight kind of way, that there is an objective security rationale here, that they are standing at the foot of the alleyway, that you could throw a grenade into the patio area? Do you concede that just looking at the situation and not thinking, not taking into account any evidence of what was in their heads, that there in fact is an objective security rationale for moving people from this area? Mr. Wilker, sorry to take you back to this, but in this-- --case, do you concede that a reasonable officer, even if not these officers, these officers might have had a terrible motivation, but that a reasonable officer could look at this map and say, look at the distance between the alley and the outdoor patio, you can throw an explosive in there, that seems really bad, let's get these people out of the way? Could a reasonable officer have said that? I'm not sure I understand that, because it seems to me there either is or isn't a valid security interest. Now, whether they acted because of that valid security interest is, of course, a different question, and you might say, well, there was a valid security interest, but that's not why they acted. But as to the first question, I mean, there either is one or there isn't one, no? And we look at it and we say, what would a reasonable police officer think of the security interest here? What would a reasonable police officer do? Would he clear this area or not?

2013,Harris v. Quinn,114,Elena Kagan,"But your argument, of course, isn't limited to that. It goes beyond that situation? But what -- what you're objecting to, to the extent that you're not objecting to the entire system of collective bargaining, you're objecting -- you're saying an individual employee can say I don't feel like supporting a union that makes a certain kind of argument about wages or about benefits. So, just to carry on with Justice Scalia's example, the subject matter is the exact same in the two contexts, whether it's an individual employee or whether it's a union, and in both contexts, the -- the ultimate sanction is the same, right? Somebody grouses about his pay too much, he could get fired. Somebody refuses to support a union that is negotiating about pay, he can lose his job. So it's -- it's really identical across the two situations. Same subject matter, same sanction. What's the difference? But you're not objecting, I think, to the union as a whole. What you're objecting to is an individual employee having to support that activity. The scale is no different. It's an individual employee. But that's exactly what the individual employee in Justice Scalia's hypothetical is arguing for. He wants wage rates to be changed across the board. He knows they're not going to be changed just for him. He wants higher wage rates. Mr. Messenger, I'm not sure that Justice Scalia's answer satisfies his own question. [Laughter] Because here's the thing: That in the workplace we've given the government a very wide degree of latitude and there's much that the government can do. It can fire people. It can demote people for things that they say in the workplace, not for things that they say as a citizen, but for things that they say in the workplace. That's the fundamental lesson of Garcetti and of many, many others of our cases. So you're saying, well, the government can punish somebody for saying something, but the government in the exact same position cannot compel somebody to say something they disagree with. And I want to know what's the basis for that distinction, which it seems to me is just as hard as -- as if you were answering under the petition clause. Good, okay. Mr. Messenger-- --So, Mr. Messenger, even on the compulsory fees, I mean, what strikes me is that this is -- I'm just going to use the word here, it is a radical argument. It would radically restructure the way workplaces across this country are -- are run. And let me just put it to you this way and ask if you agree with this -- with this statement. Since 1948, since the Taft-Hartley Act, there has been a debate in every State across this country about whether to be a right-to-work State and people have disagreed. Some States say yes, some States say no. It raises considerable heat and passion and tension, as we recently saw in Wisconsin. And -- but, you know, these are public policy choices that States make. And is it fair to say that what you're suggesting here, your argument, is essentially to say that for 65 years, people have been debating the wrong question when they've been debating that, because, in fact, a right-to-work law is constitutionally compelled? Mr. Messenger, do you doubt that these -- you said that there were no reliance interests, and -- and that's curious to me. There must be thousands and thousands of contracts across the United States with fair share provisions. Do you doubt that these were core central provisions in the making of these contracts? That if these kinds of provisions were prohibited, the -- the agreements would look fundamentally different in many ways? You think that the union would -- would not ask for anything, would not have different -- you know, would not ask for different mechanisms in order to support its own activity? The unions go into these contracts with the understanding that this is what's going to enable them to at once satisfy their universal obligation to employees to fairly represent them and also, get the funds they need for administrative and other expenses. So you think that if we just strike these provisions, in other words, the -- the contracts would have been negotiated in exactly the same way, nothing else would have changed? ",but your argument of course be not limit to that it go beyond that situation but what what you be object to to the extent that you be not object to the entire system of collective bargaining you be object you be say an individual employee can say i do not feel like support a union that make a certain kind of argument about wage or about benefit so just to carry on with justice scalia s example the subject matter be the exact same in the two context whether it be an individual employee or whether it be a union and in both context the the ultimate sanction be the same right somebody grouse about his pay too much he could get fire somebody refuse to support a union that be negotiate about pay he can lose his job so it be it be really identical across the two situation same subject matter same sanction what be the difference but you be not object i think to the union as a whole what you be object to be an individual employee have to support that activity the scale be no different it be an individual employee but that be exactly what the individual employee in justice scalia s hypothetical be argue for he want wage rate to be change across the board he know they be not go to be change just for him he want high wage rate mr messenger I be not sure that justice scalia s answer satisfy his own question laughter because here s the thing that in the workplace we have give the government a very wide degree of latitude and there be much that the government can do it can fire people it can demote people for thing that they say in the workplace not for thing that they say as a citizen but for thing that they say in the workplace that be the fundamental lesson of garcetti and of many many others of our case so you be say well the government can punish somebody for say something but the government in the exact same position can not compel somebody to say something they disagree with and i want to know what be the basis for that distinction which it seem to me be just as hard as as if you we be answer under the petition clause good okay mr messenger so mr messenger even on the compulsory fee i mean what strike me be that this be I be just go to use the word here it be a radical argument it would radically restructure the way workplaces across this country be be run and let me just put it to you this way and ask if you agree with this with this statement since since the taft hartley act there have be a debate in every state across this country about whether to be a right to work state and people have disagree some state say yes some state say no it raise considerable heat and passion and tension as we recently saw in wisconsin and but you know these be public policy choice that state make and be it fair to say that what you be suggest here your argument be essentially to say that for year people have be debate the wrong question when they have be debate that because in fact a right to work law be constitutionally compel mr messenger do you doubt that these you say that there we be no reliance interest and and that be curious to me there must be thousand and thousand of contract across the united state with fair share provision do you doubt that these we be core central provision in the making of these contract that if these kind of provision we be prohibit the the agreement would look fundamentally different in many way you think that the union would would not ask for anything would not have different you know would not ask for different mechanism in order to support its own activity the union go into these contract with the understanding that this be what be go to enable them to at once satisfy their universal obligation to employee to fairly represent them and also get the fund they need for administrative and other expense so you think that if we just strike these provision in other word the the contract would have be negotiate in exactly the same way nothing else would have change ,259.66,Roberts Court,"Jan 21, 2014","Pamela Harris, Ellen Bronfeld, Carole Gulo, Michelle Harris, Wendy Partridge, Theresa Riffey, Stephanie Yencer-Price, Susan Watts, and Patricia Withers","Pat Quinn, in his official capacity as governor of the State of Illinois, SEIU Healthcare Illinois & Indiana, SEIU Local 73, and AFSCME Council 31",11-681,"Oct 1, 2013","Jun 30, 2014",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2013,Walden v. Fiore,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, what does it mean -- what does it mean in the context of an intentional tort, which is what we're talking about here, to aim at a particular State, if it doesn't mean to aim at a person who you know to be within that State? I mean, nobody conducts an intentional tort intending to injure California per se. You're intending to injure a person who resides in California. So what would it actually mean to aim conduct at a State irrespective of a person? Well, suppose -- suppose -- and I'm sorry. Please. Yes. I guess I just -- the -- the McIntyre example is a very different kind of example because in those cases, you really are talking about a company seeking to serve a general market in a State. But intentional tort cases don't usually have that quality. You're going after a particular person in an intentional tort case. And it's odd to think of going after an intentional -- a particular person, whether it's a defamation suit or it's a fraud suit or -- or what have you, as -- as targeting the State itself. Would you -- would your answer be different, suppose that the officer had said, you can keep -- you can keep your money, go on to Nevada with it, and then, once the Fiores had reached Nevada the officer said -- the officer filed a false affidavit, which, let's say, froze the Fiores' bank accounts. Would your -- would your answer be different? The affidavit was filed in Georgia, but the money was not seized in Georgia, instead, the money has gone on to Nevada. Is there personal jurisdiction in Nevada? Well, he did it by filing an affidavit in Georgia and then it froze a bank account. Ms. Sherry, just to try to figure out how far your argument goes, suppose there's an IRS agent sitting in Washington, D.C., and she maliciously does something, files an affidavit, does whatever she does to impose a tax penalty on somebody in Nevada and everything that she does happens in Washington, D.C.-- Does the person in Nevada, who is the victim of this malicious attempt to impose a tax penalty, have to go to Washington, D.C. to sue her? Well, she's a very mobile person. She lives in Nevada, but she goes other places, and -- and this could, you know, harm her wherever she goes. Isn't that what you said? So why should she be able to bring suit in Nevada under your view? Well, if it were about them-- --So -- so suppose they seized a gold watch-- --and then they refused to return the gold watch. But the gold watch really is still sitting there in Georgia. Okay? Would you say that -- that then there's -- there's personal jurisdiction in Nevada? Yeah, they seize it and then there's a false affidavit keeping it. And the complaint is only about the false affidavit, but it's in reference to property that is indisputably in Georgia. Mr. Goldstein, as I understood what Mr. Bucholtz was saying, he was saying there is a distinction between an officer who commits a fraud in Georgia, when your money is in Nevada, and so he commits a fraud and he freezes your bank accounts in Nevada, versus he commits a fraud by filing this affidavit. But it is as to money that is located where he is, not where you are, but where he is in Georgia. That's the distinction that I understood him to be drawing. What do you think about that? I'm sorry. So there'd be a difference if the bag had been shipped to Washington, D.C.? And, you know, money is -- is fungible. Money is everywhere and nowhere. So it -- it seems as though money is a bit different from a gold watch, that -- that it was -- it's only contingent that the money remained in Atlanta rather than being shipped to a bank someplace else. ",well what do it mean what do it mean in the context of an intentional tort which be what we be talk about here to aim at a particular state if it do not mean to aim at a person who you know to be within that state i mean nobody conduct an intentional tort intend to injure california per se you be intend to injure a person who reside in california so what would it actually mean to aim conduct at a state irrespective of a person well suppose suppose and I be sorry please yes i guess i just the the mcintyre example be a very different kind of example because in those case you really be talk about a company seek to serve a general market in a state but intentional tort case do not usually have that quality you be go after a particular person in an intentional tort case and it be odd to think of go after an intentional a particular person whether it be a defamation suit or it be a fraud suit or or what have you as as target the state itself would you would your answer be different suppose that the officer have say you can keep you can keep your money go on to nevada with it and then once the fiores have reach nevada the officer say the officer file a false affidavit which let us say freeze the fiores bank account would your would your answer be different the affidavit be file in georgia but the money be not seize in georgia instead the money have go on to nevada be there personal jurisdiction in nevada well he do it by file an affidavit in georgia and then it freeze a bank account ms sherry just to try to figure out how far your argument go suppose there be an irs agent sit in washington dc and she maliciously do something file an affidavit do whatever she do to impose a tax penalty on somebody in nevada and everything that she do happens in washington dc do the person in nevada who be the victim of this malicious attempt to impose a tax penalty have to go to washington dc to sue her well she be a very mobile person she live in nevada but she go other place and and this could you know harm her wherever she go be not that what you say so why should she be able to bring suit in nevada under your view well if it we be about them so so suppose they seize a gold watch and then they refuse to return the gold watch but the gold watch really be still sit there in georgia okay would you say that that then there be there be personal jurisdiction in nevada yeah they seize it and then there be a false affidavit keep it and the complaint be only about the false affidavit but it be in reference to property that be indisputably in georgia mr goldstein as i understand what mr bucholtz be say he be say there be a distinction between an officer who commit a fraud in georgia when your money be in nevada and so he commit a fraud and he freeze your bank account in nevada versus he commit a fraud by file this affidavit but it be as to money that be locate where he be not where you be but where he be in georgia that be the distinction that i understand him to be draw what do you think about that I be sorry so there would be a difference if the bag have be ship to washington dc and you know money be be fungible money be everywhere and nowhere so it it seem as though money be a bit different from a gold watch that that it be it be only contingent that the money remain in atlanta rather than be ship to a bank someplace else ,221.98999999999995,Roberts Court,"Nov 4, 2013",Anthony Walden,"Gina Fiore, Keith Gipson",12-574,"Mar 4, 2013","Feb 25, 2014",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2013,Lane v. Franks,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, why should we get to that question? It wasn't decided below. It's their law. Why shouldn't we kick it back to the Eleventh Circuit? I understand. But what do we do if the subpoena is not to the government and if the subpoena is just to the particular person? What are the -- what's the context in which that person should not receive a minimum of protection subject to Pickering balancing, but that that should be -- why not consider that protected? Well, Mr. Gershengorn, could I ask the question that I tried and failed to ask Mr. Singh? Because Justice Breyer is, of course, completely right. This footnote 2 doesn't really answer the question. It answers it on a hypothesis that the constitutional issue came out in a certain way, and then it said, a fortiori of course, you are right, there is immunity. So it didn't really -- if there was a different decision as to the constitutional question, it didn't answer the question of qualified immunity. And, of course, it's Eleventh Circuit law. Why would we be deciding it. But are you suggesting that when somebody learns something from his job, that that means it's not speech by a citizen? No, but when he's using factual matter that he only knows because he's an employee in a particular branch of government. But then, I mean, we've said several times things like this: Government employees are often in the best position to know what ails the agencies for which they work. In other words, expecting that people will know things because they work in a place and that they can take what they know as a result of working in a place and go out and be a citizen. But if I could just understand what you're saying. Are -- are you saying that, no matter what the employee's official duties are, as long as he gets information because he is a public employee and he is in a workplace, that that's what matters? I mean, I know all kinds of things about a workplace that go beyond exactly what my official responsibilities are. So if I communicate things that I learn in a workplace, but, you know, I have nothing to do with prosecuting corruption or with investigating corruption, do I count as an employee, or do I not count as an employee in that context?

2013,Chadbourne and Parke LLP v. Troice,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, suppose you say you're going to pay off the loan by selling some stockholdings eventually. What if people reach a prenuptial agreement and as part of the prenuptial agreement they agree that in a year, one party to the marriage is going to sell as many shares of Google stock and buy a home with it. Is that covered by the securities laws now? Well, how is it removed from that? Because it has the same structural features, which is it's a misrepresentation about what you're going to do with securities, but, in fact, does not affect any securities trading. What it affects is a decision to do something else, here to buy CDs or in my example to go get married. In all of our cases, there's been something to say when somebody can ask the question: How has this affected a potential purchaser or seller in the market for the relevant securities? And here there's nothing to say. Somebody, not necessarily the victim of the fraud, but somebody has to have had some transaction in the market. It's the kind of misrepresentation that would affect someone in making transactions in the covered market. How would this do that? Ms. Goldenberg, suppose I think that the correct test is something along the lines of what Justice Breyer just said, is -- is this the kind of representation that could affect somebody? It doesn't have to be the victim of the fraud, it can be somebody else, but that could affect somebody's decision to buy or sell or hold covered securities. Can you satisfy that test? Could -- could you go back to the Madoff case-- --because you portrayed it as investors joining into funds that directly held stock, and I thought that it was more complicated than that.

2013,Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. -- please. Is -- is your argument dependent on the following two facts: The first that there was a probable cause determination, and the second that the Susan Anthony group and the other group wanted to repeat the exact same statement? Are those the two things that -- that ground your argument? So if -- I'm sorry. But that would suggest something even broader. That would suggest that even in the first instance, before the probable cause determination was made, Susan Anthony would know that it's going to be speaking about a very controversial subject in which some people will think it's telling the truth and other people will think it's lying, and that there's a very good chance that somebody is going to bring this to the Commission. So that would suggest that they have standing even at that moment before the initial probable cause determination is made. Well, what would happen, Mr. Feigin, what would happen if a candidate knew -- it seems actually quite plausible that Representative Driehaus would know -- that this was something that Susan Anthony or some other like group would talk about in his campaign, and he were to write letters to all these groups saying, if you start advertising in this way, if you put up billboards, I'm going to take you before the Ohio Commission. Would that be sufficient? I'm not sure I understood that. Is it sufficient that somebody has said, I'm going to bring an action against -- before the Commission, but there's been no prior Commission determination as to this speech. And it's just somebody saying, I'm going to go to the Commission and raise this with them if you start speaking in this way. Would that present a credible threat? Now, take it just a step further. Surely, there are some kinds of statements or -- I don't know. Maybe ""surely"" is the wrong word. Are there some kinds of statements where, even though the -- the representative doesn't say, I'm going to do this, you know that somebody is going to do this, whether the representative or somebody else? It's the kind of statement that, given this process, it's just going to require too much fortitude to resist the temptation to bring this in front of this Commission. Well, I'm not sure it's a reputational harm. I mean, why isn't, as Justice Ginsburg suggested, the relevant harm the probable cause determination itself? There are voters out there and they don't know that probable cause is such a low bar as you describe it. They think probable cause means you probably lied, and that seems a reasonable thing for them to think and that's a relevant harm and we should just -- you know, we don't even need the prosecution to serve as the relevant harm. That seems quite enough. Well, but why wouldn't it get into Federal court? I mean, your own office expresses grave concern about the constitutionality of this statute. So that suggests somebody should be able to get into Federal court to do this. But I don't see a way where you would allow a pre-enforcement challenge. One would have to go through the entire process and get to the end of it and get a judgment to enable a challenge under your theory; is that right?

2013,Prado Navarette v. California,114,Elena Kagan,"But in the context in which we've approved sobriety checkpoints, why should we get bent out of shape over this? Well, but why is that an important line? Why should we be more concerned when an individual automobile is pulled over? But if I understand you correctly, as long as you can identify the car, you need no specificity as to what the car has actually done. In other words, you know, just saying the driver was reckless is enough. Is that -- is that correct? What would fail your test? And, Mr. Laurence, do I understand what you're saying? You're saying that in every case when we have to decide whether the threshold level of reasonable suspicion has been met or whether the level of probable cause has been met, that courts can take into account the seriousness of the offense, and what would not count as probable cause for one crime will count as probable cause for another? Is that what you're saying? Well, I don't understand how what you're saying is different from what I just said, and that would seem to me to work quite a substantial change in -- in Fourth Amendment law. That when we decide whether reasonable suspicion exists, when -- whether probable cause exists, that we get to take into account how serious the offense is. The balancing occurs categorically. We decide that there's a reasonable suspicion standard by balancing interests. What we don't do is say, you know, depending on how serious we think this crime is, more or less will meet that reasonable suspicion standard. That would be a very substantial reworking of Fourth Amendment law or so it seems to me. Maybe I'm wrong. So do you think, Mr. Laurence, if the police had followed this man for half an hour and seen no other signs of erratic driving and nobody can drunk drive -- can drive drunk for half an hour without swerving, without doing something else. So they could still have stopped the car? Well, I thought you were saying as long as somebody had -- had given an account that sometime ago he had driven another driver off -- he had run another driver off the road, doesn't matter whether you're drunk, doesn't matter anything, there was an account of an illegal act taking place, and that was enough to stop him. Doesn't matter what he's doing now. But all crime represents a threat to public safety, and yet we have these standards. Well, what -- what goes on the other side of the line? I mean, why -- why is this on one side and then tell me what's on the other. How about somebody cutting someone off in their lane?

If you look at 522(l)-- --(l) says, ""unless a party in interest objects, the property claimed as exempt is exempt.

General, would you agree that this clause now is not mostly used to deal with emergencies arising from congressional absence? That most modern Presidents -- and I say this sort of going -- going back to President Reagan, Presidents of both parties essentially have used this clause as a way to deal, not with congressional absence, but with congressional intransigence, with a Congress that simply does not want to approve appointments that the President thinks ought to be approved? You know, absence in this day and age -- this is not the horse and buggy era anymore. There's no real -- there's no such thing truly as congressional absence anymore. And that makes me wonder whether we're dealing here with what's essentially an historic relic, something whose original purpose has disappeared and has assumed a new purpose that nobody ever intended it to have. Yes, as a result of congressional refusal, not as a result of congressional action. General, I think that's a really strong argument, but I have to say I'm not sure it applies consistently throughout each of the three claims that you make. Because if you are going to rely on history and on the development of an equilibrium with respect to what “ happens ” means, and if you are going to do that again with respect to whether intra-session recesses are included, then it seems to me you also have to look to history and the development of an equilibrium with respect to Congress's definition of its own power to determine whether they are in recess or not. In other words, your third argument about pro forma sessions, the history is entirely on the Senate's side, not on your side. And if we're going to take a kind of continuing practice and the development of equilibrium seriously, you might win on questions 1 and 2 and then lose on question 3. Suppose it was -- suppose it was the exact same no-business order, but the single senator who was there got up and asked for unanimous consent to name a post office, and every three days, he got up and said unanimous consent to name a post office. The post office is named. So they can do, you know, trivial business in each of these sessions. Would that make a constitutional difference? But that, again, suggests that the rule that you're asking us to establish is -- is so easy to evade that why bother establishing it at all. The fact that it's so easy to evade suggests that this really is -- the question of how to define a recess really does belong to the Senate. I totally take your point on that. But what I'm suggesting is they can just come back, and by naming post offices, have the same effect, that they would write it out of the -- of the Constitution as much as you say this does. Mr. Francisco, I'm sorry, but could we go back to Justice Alito's question, because I really have the same issue with your argument. You know, suppose that on one -- let's say the “ happens ” argument, that yours is at least the most natural reading of the statute, at least the way we understand the word “ happen ” today, and maybe a compelled reading, but the history points so much in the other direction; and that that history brings with it a whole set of practices and traditions and ways of dealing with each other that has grown around a certain interpretation of what “ happens ” means, right? The idea that we would wake up one fine morning and chuck all of that because all of a sudden we happened to read the clause, I mean, that at least needs to be defended. I know, but now, you're -- you're again -- I mean, assume that there is a 200-year-old established practice, everybody has agreed to it, but the text, when you really look at it, points the other way. Mr. Francisco, tell me if I am wrong about this, but it seems to me that intra-session recesses really only arose in the 1940s or so, right? There is the period with Andrew Johnson and Andrew Johnson used intra-recess -- intra-session recesses to make a lot of appointments. Other than that, intra-session recesses of more than 3 days that are not Christmas simply do not exist. So that assume that as intra-session recesses came to be Presidents started making appointments in them. Mr. Francisco, can I ask a question about the second question presented, the “ happens ” question? And if you put aside all the history and you look only at the language and you look only at our own modern view of what happens, that surely seems to favor your position. But if, you know, given all the statements in the founding period itself about how this is ambiguous and it might have two meanings, if you look at the dictionaries of that time -- so I went back and I looked at the Oxford English Dictionary, and one of the definitions of “ happens ” there is “ chance to be ”, essentially the exact same definition that Thomas Jefferson said made this ambiguous. And we would never use “ happens ” in that way now. If you look at the examples that the Oxford English gives, they're laughable. Nobody would ever say that now. But it just suggested to me that maybe what we think is pretty clear is only pretty clear because one meaning of happens has, you know, over 200 years-- --lapsed. No, I don't think so. Essentially, Thomas Jefferson says it could mean one thing or the other, and the other thing that he said, which is “ happens to exist ”, is sort of exactly this old definition, which is “ happens ” means “ chance to be ”. You know, I don't remember them exactly. I just remember kind of laughing at them, as things that-- [Laughter] --nobody would say-- Mr. Estrada, you said in your brief that that was true within wide limits. What are the wide limits? Is the Chief Justice's example before, if the Senate just said, we're -- we're never in recess for purposes of appointments, would that be permissible. But people object all the time to things that in fact they can't do anything about, right? ",general i think you be you be not answer the real thrust of the chief justice s question which be that we could just be back here if we if we say well they do not phrase this in the right way well they will phrase it differently and we would be back here with the same essential problem that you be ask us to peg this on a formality that the senate could easily evade and that suggest that it

2013,Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Keisler, I'm sorry. Can I ask about your interpretation of the phrase “ any air pollutant ”? Because there are a lot of different interpretations that have gone on among the various briefs and among the lower court opinions in this case. So here are some choices, all right? And I want really to ask you to pick what you're arguing for. Your original position was that “ any air pollutant ” meant any NAAQS pollutant for which the area is in attainment; that was your original position. Judge Kavanaugh's position is that it means any NAAQS pollutant. There is another position that goes on in the briefs that says no, it doesn't mean any NAAQS pollutant; it means any local pollutant, whether or not it's a NAAQS pollutant; and there is still another position that says it's really any regulated pollutant other than greenhouse gases. So those are four different interpretations that all of the folks on your side, and I realize there are a lot of them, have presented. And I guess I'm asking you which one you're arguing for. When you say area-specific, I mean, I take it that these sort of ozone pollutants are not area-specific. Would your interpretation exclude those as well? But, again, that's because they're not local. Mr. Keisler, if I could follow up, really, on Justice Breyer's question, because the conundrum here, you keep saying: Look, EPA is violating this specific statutory term. But the conundrum that this cases raises is that everybody is violating a statutory term. EPA is saying, no, we can't do the 100 to 250 with respect to greenhouse gases, but you are also violating a statutory term. You know, it says any pollutant or it says in the other provision each pollutant subject to regulation. Nobody would think that the most natural, most reasonable readings of those phrases are any pollutant if they have localized effects, but not otherwise. So I mean, what's happened here is that you have this new kind of emission that basically makes these two terms of the statute irreconcilable, and the agency has essentially picked one. It said: Look, we're not going to just exempt a broad class of pollutants. Instead, we're going to fudge the numbers. And why isn't that the more reasonable of the two things to do? Well, I think I don't really understand. But I mean, it's true that one is a number. But the other, each pollutant subject to regulation or any air pollutant, what the EPA has done is for 30 years across presidential administrations treated those phrases as meaning a single thing, which I think if you put aside the absurdity problem in this case, everybody would agree is the most reasonable interpretation of those phrases. And you're saying the EPA should junk that most reasonable interpretation of those phrases because there's a new kind of emitted -- emitted chemical or whatever that makes the numbers not work. Well, but that's not Judge Kavenaugh's position. I thought Judge Kavenaugh's position is any NAAQS pollutant, all NAAQS pollutants. And it comes from a different portion of the statutory language. Can I ask, Mr. Cavanaugh, why Judge Kavenaugh's argument has been left by the wayside? Well, it does -- it comes from different statutory language. His arguments about the structure of the statute don't apply to your argument. So I think, notwithstanding that there is some overlap between the arguments, the legal rationales are entirely different, and I guess I'm just curious. General, I take it that the unambiguous statutory language that you are referring to is the references to 100 and to 250. And it seems to me that that's an odd kind of term to drive such an important statutory interpretation question, because what those numbers were all about is that they were supposed to separate major emitters from minor emitters. I mean, they were supposed to be about the size of the facility. They were not supposed to have -- they were not supposed to make any distinctions as to the type of pollutant. So you're essentially using those numbers to make distinctions as to the type of pollutant rather than, it seems to me and more sensible approach would be to say, look, the 100 and 250 numbers don't work for this new kind of pollutant, we're going to up the numbers, and that will be the rest of the statute and all the purposes of Congress intact. But, General, if you think about the question of what any pollutant means, and you put aside this whole absurdity question that the numbers get you to, you just say, what does any air pollutant mean? Does it mean what EPA has said it has meant for 30 years, which is any pollutant that's regulated under this Act, or does it mean something more along the lines of what you're saying, which is anything other than greenhouse gases or anything other than pollutants that have particular localized effects. You would obviously choose EPA's version of the thing. And the only reason that you're not choosing that is because of these numbers that are in the statute, which were designed only, only to distinguish between major and minor emitters. So if you can distinguish between major and minor emitters while keeping the completely sensible longstanding interpretation of any pollutant, why wouldn't you do that? General, one question is what would Congress have wanted, given the obvious purposes of the Act. And that's an important question. Another question is: What did the agency decide here? I mean, obviously, this is the apex of Chevron deference. There's nothing that gets more deference than this Agency with respect to this complicated a statute. And given that this whole thing arises because there's this new kind of emission, which -- which the numbers don't work for, so which essentially makes these two terms in the statute irreconcilable, why isn't that a classic case for deference to the Agency, that the Agency gets to choose how to make the thing work as best it can, when a changed circumstance makes it work not entirely the way Congress had foretold? General -- general, if I could actually get back to Justice Alito's question, because I had a similar issue with what EPA did here. It seems to me it would be completely responsible and understandable if EPA had said, look, the 100 and 250 don't work with respect to this category of pollutant, Congress didn't know that this kind of pollutant was out there when it wrote those numbers, what it was trying to do was to distinguish between major and minor emitters, the new numbers are X and Y for that -- for this kind of pollutant. But, you know, and I understand that EPA may have felt like, oh, gosh, can we really do that? But the solution that EPA came up with actually seems to give it complete discretion to do whatever it wants, whenever it wants to, and to not -- and to be much more problematic than if EPA had just said, no, it's not 100 and 250. It's 10 times that. And-- --General, wouldn't it be right to say that the rule that Justice Scalia is referring to only applies if there are alternative interpretations that are consistent with the legislative purpose. There have to be plausible alternative interpretations of the statute. And reading the phrase “ any pollutant ” to mean any pollutant except for greenhouse gases for reasons that have nothing to do with the purposes of the statute is not a plausible alternative interpretation. Wouldn't that be the argument? But isn't that the argument? Justice's Scalia's alternative plausible interpretation of the statutes might have been an alternative plausible interpretation of the statute pre-Massachusetts. But it no longer is; isn't that right? Could I -- sorry. Trying to understand that. Would you pick the number that leads to the same class of emitters? Is that the number you would pick? As in the more typical emissions context. So 100-- --captures a certain set of emitters. Are you essentially looking for the number that captures the same class of emitters? ",mr keisler I be sorry can i ask about your interpretation of the phrase any air pollutant because there be a lot of different interpretation that have go on among the various brief and among the low court opinion in this case so here be some choice all right and i want really to ask you to pick what you be argue for your original position be that any air pollutant mean any naaqs pollutant for which the area be in attainment that be your original position judge kavanaugh s position be that it mean any naaqs pollutant there be another position that go on in the brief that say no it do not

2013,Atlantic Marine Construction Company v. U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Hastings, Section 1391 says the following, ""Except as otherwise provided by law. "" --not by contract -- ""by law, this section shall govern -- shall govern -- the venue of all -- all civil actions brought in district courts of the United States. "" And then it goes on to specify certain rules for where venue in a case can lie. So if I'm looking at that, I'm thinking, well, those rules apply. And they can't be reversed or countermanded or whatever by -- by contract, by parties' agreement except to the extent that the contract can figure centrally into the 1404 analysis. But it's not appropriate in the 1406 analysis because, you know, the statute says what the statute says. Here is venue. Mr. Hastings, I wonder what you think of this analogy: Any party can waive a personal jurisdiction defense, but would you say that parties by contract can create personal jurisdiction in a court in which it otherwise doesn't exist? Well, as I said, anybody can waive it. Just like anybody can waive almost everything in our -- in -- in the way the Federal rules work. But do you think that parties can actually create personal jurisdiction where it doesn't exist by law? Mr. Hastings, has 12(b)(6) ever been used to your knowledge to deal with a case in which the question is which court the plaintiff should have brought the suit in, rather than whether the plaintiff has a viable claim in any court? Because it seems to me a bit of a category error. The 12(b)(6) is something -- it's an on-the-merits determination about the viability of your claim. It has res judicata effect, whereas this is not. This is just a question of, did you bring the thing in the right place and you should be allowed to bring it someplace else. No, I know the courts have. I'm saying, except for this kind of case, has a court ever used 12(b)(6) to deal with a case of which court? Or to deal with anything that's not an on-the-merits determination that precludes a case in any court? But, Mr. Allensworth, where you agreed not to bring it. So I'm going back to what Justice Breyer says. Let's suppose you're right about 1404, and I think you have some pretty good arguments. 1404, it seems to me, shouldn't affect this case in the sense that you should have -- this was a negotiated contract. You got something for the fact that you accepted inconvenience when you brought a suit. And under 1404, the court is perfectly entitled -- the court has to take that into account, that this was a negotiated contract, that you accepted in convenience, and that you got something for your -- for your acceptance of inconvenience. The end. You have to live with your contract. Well, it does in this way. It does in this way. 1404, as Justice Ginsburg said, is a codification of forum non conveniens law, which is a balancing of private and public interests. It seems to me what Justice Alito said was absolutely right. You have given up the ability to claim private interests here by virtue of your choice to sign that contract. The only thing that could weigh in the balance against that is if there is some -- something that has nothing to do with your convenience but is instead a feature of -- of -- something about why it's important to the judicial system, to the public interest, about keeping the trial in one place. And as Justice Alito suggested, you have not been able to point to anything, nor would there be anything to point to, in most cases involving forum selection clauses. No. Bremen is an admiralty case. Why won't it just be a forum non conveniens? Yes. I mean, 1404, it says that if it's says -- if the contract clause specifies a Federal court, it's a 1404 motion. If it specifies a State court, it's a forum non conveniens motion. Well, it's not 1406. It's just forum non conveniens, which is-- --Professor Sachs says that in the case of any disputed facts on a 12(b)(6), you would have to have a trial. Do you agree with that? I think you mistook my point at least. Maybe I didn't express it clearly. Bremen comes up on a forum non conveniens motion, and the Court says, yes, the contract controls, quite properly so. So, you know, the fact that it comes up on a forum non conveniens motion has nothing to do with the question of whether the contract controls where, if it negotiated for a certain set of things and there is no exceptional public interest otherwise. Can I ask you one last question about 12(b)(6)? Which is, you know, when 1404 is -- suppose a state which does not recognize these clauses, 1404 trumps that according to Stewart.

2013,McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, let's say this one, Ms. Murphy. Let's say this one: You have 100 PACs and each of them say that they're going to support the five contest -- the five candidates in the most contested Senate races. There are really only five very contested Senate races, and 100 PACs say that they're going to support those five candidates. So a donor gives $5,000 to each of those 100 PACs which support those candidates, the PAC divides up the money, $1,000 goes to each candidate. The total, all those PACs, $100,000 goes to each of the -- of the Senate candidates in the five most contested races, 20 times what the individual contribution limits allow. This candidate knows all of his $100,000 donors. There are not all that many of them. He can keep them all in his head in a mental Rolodex. Five of the most contested Senate races. So a person gives $100,000 to each of five candidates who if they win become the five senators that are most attuned to donors. And he knows who's giving him $100,000, each of those five senators who gets in on the strength of these contributions that are 20 times what the individual limits allow. Ms. Murphy, if you think it's earmarking that have a PAC that gives money to the five most -- the candidates in the five most contested Senate races, I just don't think any FEC would say that that's earmarking. Ms. Murphy, can I give another one? There are 150 House candidates with completely safe seats, all right? And there are maybe, you know, 30 or 40 or something like that in their party who don't have safe seats. So the 150 gets together and they say we're going to run a joint fundraiser. And anybody can contribute $2600 to each of these candidates, 150 of them, right? So that makes about $400,000. And then these 150 candidates with completely safe seats just transfer all this money to the one person who doesn't have a safe seat. So that's about $400,000. Double it for a primary and a general election, that's about $800,000 that all goes to one candidate from one donor because of the ability for candidates to transfer money to each other. A candidate can transfer a maximum of $2600 to another candidate per election. I stand corrected on the basis of $600. You're exactly right. You're exactly right, Ms. Murphy. One person could make an $800,000 contribution to a House race, where $800,000 goes a long way. And then what these 150 candidates can do is they can do it for every single other candidate in a contested seat. So take your 30 or 40 House contested seats and it becomes a conduit for a single person to make an $800,000 contribution to a candidate in a contested district. Mr. Burchfield, if you take off the aggregate limits, people will be allowed, if you put together the national committees and all the State committees and all the candidates in the House and the Senate, it comes to over $3.5 million. So I can write checks totalling $3.5 million to the Republican Party committees and all its candidates or to the Democratic Party committees and all its committees even before I start writing checks to independent PACs. Now, having written a check for 3.5 or so million dollars to a single party's candidates, are you suggesting that that party and the members of that party are not going to owe me anything, that I won't get any special treatment? Because I thought that that was exactly what we said in McConnell, that when we talked about soft money restrictions, we understood that you give $3.5 million, you get a very, very special place at the table. So this is effectively to -- to reintroduce the soft money scheme of McConnell, isn't it? But the money -- the money goes to a single party. And indeed, I could make this even worse. I could say, let's say the Speaker of the House or the Majority Leader of the House solicits this money from particular people. So solicits somebody to ante up his $3.6 million. And then, you know, Justice Kennedy said in McConnell the making of a solicited gift is a quid both to the recipient of the money and to the one who solicits the payment. So the Speaker, the Majority Leader, can solicit $3.6 million to all the party members and you're telling me there's just no special influence that goes along with that? And General, I suppose that if this Court is having second thoughts about its rulings that independent expenditures are not corrupting, we could change that part of the law. [Laughter] ",well let us say this one ms murphy let us say this one you have pac and each of them say that they be go to support the five contest the five candidate in the most contested senate race there be really only five very contested senate race and pac say that they be go to support those five candidate so a donor give to each of those pac which support those candidate the pac divide up the money go to each candidate the total all those pac go to each of the of the senate candidate in the five most contested race time what the individual contribution limit allow this candidate know all of his donor there be not all that many of them he can keep them all in his head in a mental rolodex five of the most contested senate race so a person give to each of five candidate who if they win become the five senator that be most attuned to donor and he know who be give him each of those five senator who get in on the strength of these contribution that be time what the individual limit allow ms murphy if you think it be earmark that have a pac that give money to the five most the candidate in the five most contest senate race i just do not think any fec would say that that be earmark ms murphy can i give another one there be house candidate with completely safe seat all right and there be maybe you know or or something like that in their party who do not have safe seat so the get together and they say we be go to run a joint fundraiser and anybody can contribute to each of these candidate of them right so that make about and then these candidate with completely safe seat just transfer all this money to the one person who do not have a safe seat so that be about double it for a primary and a general election that be about that all go to one candidate from one donor because of the ability for candidate to transfer money to each other a candidate can transfer a maximum of to another candidate per election i stand correct on the basis of you be exactly right you be exactly right ms murphy one person could make an contribution to a house race where go a long way and then what these candidate can do be they can do it for every single other candidate in a contested seat so take your or house contest seat and it become a conduit for a single person to make an contribution to a candidate in a contested district mr burchfield if you take off the aggregate limit people will be allow if you put together the national committee and all the state committee and all the candidate in the house and the senate it come to over million so i can write check total million to the republican party committee and all its candidate or to the democratic party committee and all its committee even before i start write check to independent pac now have write a check for or so million dollar to a single party s candidate be you suggest that that party and the member of that party be not go to owe me anything that i will not get any special treatment because i think that that be exactly what we say in mcconnell that when we talk about soft money restriction we understand that you give million you get a very very special place at the table so this be effectively to to reintroduce the soft money scheme of mcconnell be not it but the money the money go to a single party and indeed i could make this even bad i could say let us say the speaker of the house or the majority leader of the house solicit this money from particular people so solicit somebody to ante up his million and then you know justice kennedy say in mcconnell the making of a solicited gift be a quid both to the recipient of the money and to the one who solicit the payment so the speaker the majority leader can solicit million to all the party member and you be tell me there be just no special influence that go along with that and general i suppose that if this court be have second thought about its ruling that independent expenditure be not corrupt we could change that part of the law laughter ,297.7700000000001,Roberts Court,"Oct 8, 2013","Shaun McCutcheon, et al.",Federal Election Commission,12-536,"Feb 19, 2013","Apr 2, 2014",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2013,"Halliburton Co. v. Erica P. John Fund, Inc.",114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Streett, that argument, of course, is just an argument that Basic was wrong in -- in -- in not focusing on -- on Section 18, and that's contestable. One could say actually, they were right not to focus on Section 18, Section 9 is the closer analog. But let's put that aside. Are you just saying Basic is wrong, or are you saying that something has changed since Basic? Because usually that's what we look for when we decide whether to reverse a case, something that makes the question fundamentally different now than when we decided it. And that's especially so in a case like this one where Congress has had every opportunity, and has declined every opportunity, to change Basic itself. So what has changed, in your view? What is your third? You said three. What is your third? So -- so you are not relying anymore on the notion that the efficient markets hypothesis has been undermined. That is not one of the three points that you're making because, essentially, I think you -- you admit this in your reply brief. You just say Halliburton has never said that market prices -- has never contested that market prices generally respond to new material information. So you are agreeing with that, that market prices generally do respond to new material information. Well, but we don't have that kind of binary approach. What we allow plaintiffs to do is to try to establish a presumption, which they do by showing that a particular market is efficient, and then we allow defendants to rebut that presumption. So there's no binary on/off switch. It's actually -- it's a presumption, but it's quite dependent on the facts in a particular case as to whether there's an exception to this general rule that market prices, in fact, do generally respond to new material information. Now, we've required them to be considered because-- --Mr. Streett, there's a -- there's a real difference with respect to those issues and I think that this was really what Amgen said. It said that when you rule on those things, it essentially splits up the class so that different members of the class are left in very different positions, but that when you rule on a question like materiality, which leaves all members of the class in the exact same position, either with a viable claim or with no claim, and it doesn't split the class in the way that the efficient markets theory do, that's the difference. And here -- and this goes back to Justice Sotomayor's question -- I just don't see how this splits the class at all because if you can't prove price impact, you can't prove loss causation and everybody's claims die. I think that the -- that the difference is that even if you don't have market efficiency and so you lose the ability to bring the -- a claim with the fraud on the market presumption, you might still have an individual reliance claim. Mr. Stewart, can I just -- can I ask a more general question? You're representing the SEC here, the principal regulators of the securities markets and the securities industry. So if -- I guess it's a two-part question. If Basic were overruled, what is -- what is the view as to what, how that would affect the securities industry and how it would affect individual decisionmaking with respect to securities? And same question for, if the law professors' position was adopted. ",mr streett that argument of course be just an argument that basic be wrong in in in not focus on on section and that be contestable one could say actually they we be right not to focus on section section be the close analog but let us put that aside be you just say basic be wrong or be you say that something have change since basic because usually that be what we look for when we decide whether to reverse a case something that make the question fundamentally different now than when we decide it and that be especially so in a case like this one where congress have have every opportunity and have decline every opportunity to change basic itself so what have change in your view what be your third you say three what be your third so so you be not rely anymore on the notion that the efficient market hypothesis have be undermine that be not one of the three point that you be make because essentially i think you you admit this in your reply brief you just say halliburton have never say that market price have never contest that market price generally respond to new material information so you be agree with that that market price generally do respond to new material information well but we do not have that kind of binary approach what we allow plaintiff to do be to try to establish a presumption which they do by show that a particular market be efficient and then we allow defendant to rebut that presumption so there be no binary onoff switch it be actually it be a presumption but it be quite dependent on the fact in a particular case as to whether there be an exception to this general rule that market price in fact do generally respond to new material information now we have require them to be consider because mr streett there be a there be a real difference with respect to those issue and i think that this be really what amgen say it say that when you rule on those thing it essentially split up the class so that different member of the class be leave in very different position but that when you rule on a question like materiality which leave all member of the class in the exact same position either with a viable claim or with no claim and it do not split the class in the way that the efficient market theory do that be the difference and here and this go back to justice sotomayor s question i just do not see how this split the class at all because if you can not prove price impact you can not prove loss causation and everybody s claim die i think that the that the difference be that even if you do not have market efficiency and so you lose the ability to bring the a claim with the fraud on the market presumption you might still have an individual reliance claim mr stewart can i just can i ask a more general question you be represent the sec here the principal regulator of the security market and the security industry so if i guess it be a two part question if basic we be overrule what be what be the view as to what how that would affect the security industry and how it would affect individual decisionmaking with respect to security and same question for if the law professor position be adopt ,205.82,Roberts Court,"Mar 5, 2014","Halliburton Co., et al","Erica P.

So let's just assume for a moment that an erroneous claim construction would be a mistake of law. Let's just assume that. And I understand you say that there's a question. But if that's right, why is it not also true that a judge's statement that a litigant -- that a litigant's claim construction was unreasonable is not a similar mistake of law?

2013,United States v. Castleman,114,Elena Kagan,"Can I ask you about that Ms. Sherry? If -- I mean, suppose we accepted your argument as to bodily injury, but offensive touching just went too far. What happens? How are the laws of the 50 States constructed? Are we going to have -- are you going to have, a terrible difficulty prosecuting real, you know, punch-in-the-nose kinds of incidents of physical violence, because there are indivisible statutes that apply to both? Well, presumably, if they're divisible, you don't have a problem. The only time you're going to have a problem -- and, again, I'm assuming that the Court will say physical touching goes too far, that that's not included under 922. So you'll have a problem as to any State statute that indivisibly makes illegal both -- both offensive touching and more violent forms of activity. How many statutes are like that? Of the 28 States, if I could just understand this-- --Of the 28 States, how many separated out on the face of the statute as between-- --offensive touching and bodily injury? How does marital rape figure in this? In a -- is a marital rape considered a bodily injury, or is that actually -- could that fall under the offensive touching? Of course, that's the same language as was in Johnson, but you would be asking us to apply it differently here. Mr. Rothfeld, I thought that what Johnson said, it defined physical force as force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person. It didn't say anything about serious pain or grievous injury. It just said force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person. That's what Johnson said. Why would we adopt a different approach? No. I mean, it specified it is not involving any level, that -- that there was no inquiry into level. It's force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person. That's the clear standard in the holding. Ms. Sherry said 14. And is that your view, too? Mr. Rothfeld, how serious do you think the injury has to be? What -- what counts as serious enough injury? But Mr. Rothfeld, this might go back to our difference on what Johnson said. But you're asking us to apply a higher standard than Johnson, which just said force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person without any notion of seriousness or grievousness or whatnot. And, you know, I -- I can see an argument that says we should apply the exact same standard as Johnson. I can see an argument that says actually, we should apply a lower standard because this is misdemeanors rather than felonies, but I guess I can't see an argument about why we should apply a higher standard than Johnson.

Here's our claim. Well, Mr. Curran, really, do you -- are you saying that as a matter of State law, that in this suit the attorney general has to make a proposal that -- that the plaintiff -- that -- that he can bring the suit on the grounds that the plaintiffs' claims involve common questions of law or fact and that that proposal has to be adjudicated by the Court? But he does not have to show any common questions of law or fact in the typical way that we demand. I mean, that's actually a very demanding showing that we have forced lawyers to make in the class action context. All that the attorney general has to do is to stand up and say, I have a State interest in protecting my citizens and in deterring improper behavior and here is my substantive right. I guess I don't understand the bifurcation point. It seems to me that what the attorney general is saying is he has a set of claims. They're his claims on behalf of the -- the populace, but -- but to further State's own interests. And there -- there's none of this Rule 23 kind of business about common questions of law or fact. So it's not a question of, you know, one set of claims or another set of claims now or later. He has a claim. That's all he has. And this is the main provision where they're trying to define what mass action means. And I take your point that there are -- there's some slippage between this provision and the various provisions that it refers back to, because those provisions, we're talking about class actions and this one is talking about mass actions. But this is the essential definition. And this one seems to be pointing to a very different kind of suit, one in which there are 100 individual claims that -- that 100 people seek to have joined in which a court is going to make a determination about whether those 100 individual claims have questions of common law or fact. That's essentially what it says. I mean, the only -- the only thing it doesn't say in what you just said is that it says persons instead of named plaintiffs. But then if you read the sentence, it's pretty clear that persons and plaintiffs are the same. I might not answer it. [Laughter] But more than that-- --But more than that, Mr. Curran, is that there was actually a considered effort by the attorneys generals here to take themselves out of this statute-- --and that that -- well, you say they failed and, I mean, that's the statutory question. But it's not just Congress didn't do it right this time. It was that there was a very serious effort to get attorneys general out of this statute. And that's -- and, you know, it seems to me that they did pretty well. ",mr massey if you be right about what mass action mean in this statute what be this exception about the general public do if you go on and read that a little bit far mr curran it say claim of or more person that be propose to try jointly on the ground that the plaintiff claim involve common question of law or fact and here of course you know there be no joinder let alone any propose you know there have no there nothing that the mississippi attorney general have to go through to show that the plaintiff claim involve common question of law or fact right they do not there be no showing of that kind that have to be make in a parens patriae case but again this clearly but they do not have to show and this be clearly refer to a kind of rule inquiry which they do not have to go through to do a parens patriae yes but they do have to show that in a massive consolidation case the judge be go to say you have claim we want to see that those claim have common question of law or fact but in a parens patriae case the state never have to make that showing it can just stand up and say here we be we be the state we be represent the interest of the state across state here s our claim well mr curran really do you be you say that as a matter of state law that in this suit the attorney general have to make a proposal that that the plaintiff that that he can bring the suit on the ground that the plaintiff claim involve common question of law or fact and that that proposal have to be adjudicate by the court but he do not have to show any common question of law or fact in the typical way that we demand i mean that be actually a very demand show that we have force lawyer to make in the class action context all that the attorney general have to do be to stand up and say i have a state interest in protect my citizen and in deter improper behavior and here be my substantive right i guess i do not understand the bifurcation point it seem to me that what the attorney general be say be he have a set of claim they be his claim on behalf of the the populace but but to further state s own interest and there there be none of this rule kind of business about common question of law or fact so it be not a question of you know one set of claim or another set of claim now or later he have a claim that be all he have and this be the main provision where they be try to define what mass action mean and i take your point that there be there be some slippage between this provision and the various provision that it refer back to because those provision we be talk about class action and this one be talk about mass action but this be the essential definition and this one seem to be point to a very different kind of suit one in which there be individual claim that that people seek to have join in which a court be go to make a determination about whether those individual claim have question of common law or fact that be essentially what it say i mean the only the only thing it do not say in what you just say be that it say person instead of name plaintiff but then if you read the sentence it be pretty clear that person and plaintiff be the same i might not answer it laughter but more than that but more than that mr curran be that there be actually a consider effort by the attorney general here to take themselves out of this statute and that that well you say they fail and i mean that be the statutory question but it be not just congress do not do it right this time it be that there be a very serious effort to get attorney general out of this statute and that be and you know it seem to me that they do pretty well ,225.47,Roberts Court,"Nov 6, 2013","Mississippi, ex rel.

2013,Fernandez v. California,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Karlin, don't you find that a little bit odd? I mean, this social expectations analysis applied to a case in which a police officer has power that no person, no stranger has. The police officer has just put the man in handcuffs and taken him away. A stranger does not have that power. So it's a bit odd to say: Well, social expectations say that the stranger can walk into the house, you know, having just carted the person away. You can't do that. You see, I thought that Randolph rejected that analysis. I thought that Randolph said -- and you could agree with it or disagree with it -- but it said, and I'm quoting here, ""The cooperative occupant's invitation adds nothing to the government's side to counter the force of an objecting individual's claim to security against the government's intrusion into his dwelling place. "" So, when you have an objection, Randolph says, the objection trumps. And the fact that there is a cooperative occupant there, well, again, I'm just quoting, 〝 It adds nothing ″. I guess this goes back to my -- my other question. I find it impossible to get my head around this case without recognizing that we don't have it here, because the police have taken the objector away. And so the police themselves have, you know, properly exercised a power that is the reason we don't continue to have the situation that Randolph concerned. You don't disagree, do you, Mr. Karlin -- and I don't want to put words in your mouth -- but you don't disagree that the expectation of privacy does not decline after the arrest is made. In other words, that Mr. Fernandez's expectation of privacy remains the same. Mr. Karlin, there is in this case some indication that she was not inviting this search, that she in the end consented, but only after the police suggested that her child could be taken away and, you know, the facts of this case are not I'm standing at the door dying for you to come in. Mr. Palmore, could I ask what you think that this sentence means in Randolph? There's a -- there's a statement that says: ""So long as there is no evidence that the police have removed the potentially objecting tenant from the entrance for the sake of avoiding the possible objection. "" What do you think that means? When do you think it would apply? So it would only apply if the -- if the taking the person away from the home was unreasonable. But as long as that was lawful, whether you did it by saying, you know, come walk around the block with me or whether you actually had probable cause to arrest and you took him to the stationhouse, either way, that this language would not apply. And has anybody ever found that conduct fit within that language? Has any court ever used that language in any way to state that this, you know, this goes beyond the bounds? ",mr karlin do not you find that a little bit odd i mean this social expectation analysis apply to a case in which a police officer have power that no person no stranger have the police officer have just put the man in handcuff and take him away a stranger do not have that power so it be a bit odd to say well social expectation say that the stranger can walk into the house you know have just cart the person away you can not do that you see i think that randolph reject that analysis i think that randolph say and you could agree with it or disagree with it but it say and I be quote here the cooperative occupant s invitation add nothing to the government s side to counter the force of an object individual s claim to security against the government s intrusion into his dwell place so when you have an objection randolph say the objection trump and the fact that there be a cooperative occupant there well again I be just quote it add nothing i guess this go back to my my other question i find it impossible to get my head around this case without recognize that we do not have it here because the police have take the objector away and so the police themselves have you know properly exercise a power that be the reason we do not continue to have the situation that randolph concern you do not disagree do you mr karlin and i do not want to put word in your mouth but you do not disagree that the expectation of privacy do not decline after the arrest be make in other word that mr fernandez s expectation of privacy remain the same mr karlin there be in this case some indication that she be not invite this search that she in the end consent but only after the police suggest that her child could be take away and you know the fact of this case be not I be stand at the door die for you to come in mr palmore could i ask what you think that this sentence mean in randolph there be a there be a statement that say so long as there be no evidence that the police have remove the potentially object tenant from the entrance for the sake of avoid the possible objection what do you think that mean when do you think it would apply so it would only apply if the if the take the person away from the home be unreasonable but as long as that be lawful whether you do it by say you know come walk around the block with me or whether you actually have probable because to arrest and you take him to the stationhouse either way that this language would not apply and have anybody ever find that conduct fit within that language have any court ever use that language in any way to state that this you know this go beyond the bound ,179.67,Roberts Court,"Nov 13, 2013",Walter Fernandez,California,12-7822,"May 20, 2013","Feb 25, 2014",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2013,Environmental Protection Agency v. EME Homer City Generation,114,Elena Kagan,"Is the idea, Mr. Stewart, that the States that are required to do more are the States that haven't done much already? Can I ask a question? Can I ask a question? Following up on Justice Scalia about the statutory language and how you read it, I think, you know, most people, everybody, thinks that it's better to regulate with attention to costs than to regulate without attention to costs. We have this, our Trucking Association decision where we said, well, notwithstanding that everybody agrees that regulating with attention to costs is better, when Congress says the opposite we have to go with the opposite. And there we said Congress had said the opposite because it had talked about protecting the public health with an adequate margin of safety. Now, I'm wondering, what does it take in a statute to make us say, look, Congress has demanded that the regulation here occur without any attention to costs? In other words, essentially Congress has demanded that the regulation has occurred in a fundamentally silly way. Mr. Stewart-- --Could you explain that to me, Mr. Stewart? Because are you saying that the straight proportionality approach that was applied in the D.C. Circuit, are you saying that that's impossible or are you saying it's complicated and dumb? I'm sure I should know this after reading all these briefs, but if we -- if we reverse the D.C. Circuit what would happen going forward? In other words, the States have had this time to -- to go first and to do their SIPs. Then they were found not to comply, so the EPA does its FIP. But that's not the end of the game, is it? I mean, isn't the EPA under a continuing obligation to look at, review its NAAQS, to give the States further opportunities to come back? Mr. Mitchell, I might just not be understanding you, but this goes back to the Chief Justice's question. The statute says, look, after these standards are originally promulgated, the State gets 3 years to make its best pitch, and then the administrator shall promulgate a FIP at any time within two years after that. Now, presumably there are lots of conversations that can happen between the EPA and the States during those 5 years, and maybe sometimes more of those conversations happen and sometimes less of those conversations happen. But I don't see that as different constructions of the statute. It seems to me as the statute sets up its framework: You go first, do it within 3 years; then the EPA goes, it has to do it within 2 years. The EPA just has very substantial discretion under this statute as to what kinds of conversations it wants to have when, within that broad structure. Why am I not reading it right? Well, why can't -- this is of course a statute on which EPA gets substantial Chevron deference. Why couldn't we read that language to essentially mean subject to the same procedural requirements as the original? Well, it's not a caveat. It's just a different understanding of what that language means. I mean, you say it has to be in the exact same -- in the exact same way they previously acted, and I guess I'm saying it could mean subject to the exact same procedural requirements. Was that not clear? Was that unclear? Whatever procedural requirements constrained EPA when it approved the SIP, those were the same procedural requirements that constrained EPA when it's disapproved the SIP. But we're just asking are they -- you know, both are -- have to be subject to the same procedural requirements. EPA can act differently as long as they are acting within that same set of rules. Well, I think that they are trying to make that argument. They are saying, in the initial version we could have done it by notice and comment rulemaking or we could have done it if we had good cause. So too when we reverse that initial determination. So, Mr. Keisler, I mean, you have a statute here that clearly does not have any language about no costs allowed, that also does not have what the American Trucking Association statute had, which was like public health only, sufficient margin of safety; right? So none of that. What you have is exactly what you said. You have a statute that focuses on causal contribution, right? So this is a hard problem, right? Because -- I mean, let me just sort of give you a numerical example, which I'm sure is as simplistic as the other numerical examples floating around this case. But, you know, let's say that the standard is a hundred. And there's a State that has 120, and there are two States, X and Y, that have each contributed 20. Right? So we -- you know, we only need 20 of those. We have 40. And the question is how do you get from those 40 to those 20. The D.C. Circuit would just say, well, we take 10 from each. But if this -- if the question is only about causal contribution and that's all that the statute talks about, there have to be other ways we can make that determination of what contribution each should be legally responsible for, right? And what the EPA said here was: We're going to distinguish between -- we're going to distinguish between States that have -- have put a lot of technology and a lot of money into this already and on the other hand States that have lots of cheap and dirty emissions. And why isn't that a perfectly rational thing to do under this very statute? But, Mr. Keisler, the nature of this problem is that there's an allocation issue. It's not just everybody gets down to a certain threshold level. It's there's a level and we have to allocate. And the question is: What are we going to allocate on the basis of? And the word ‶ amounts ″ doesn't tell you what you're going to allocate on the basis of. So there are lots of different choices for what we can allocate on the basis of. We can just divide, you know, and do it all proportionally. We can take into account per capita. We can take into account a State's population if we wanted to. Or we can take into account, as the EPA did here, costs on the understanding that costs reflect how much of an investment a State has already made in pollution technology. So the statute, neither the word ‶ amount ″ nor anything else says anything about those different methods of allocation, does it? ",be the idea mr stewart that the state that be require to do more be the state that have not do much already can i ask a question can i ask a question follow up on justice scalia about the statutory language and how you read it i think you know most people everybody think that it be well to regulate with attention to cost than to regulate without attention to cost we have this our truck association decision where we say well notwithstanding that everybody agree that regulate with attention to cost be well when congress say the opposite we have to go with the opposite and there we say congress have say the opposite because it have talk about protect the public health with an adequate margin of safety now I be wonder what do it take in a statute to make us say look congress have

explain that to me mr stewart because be you say that the straight proportionality approach that be apply in the dc circuit be you say that that be impossible or be you say it be complicate and dumb I be sure i should know this after read all these brief but if we if we reverse the dc circuit what would happen go forward in other word the state have have this time to to go first and to do their sip

2013,Unite Here Local 355 v. Mulhall,114,Elena Kagan,"In the typical case, how important is an agreement like this to the union? How much does it increase the likelihood that the union will be selected as the exclusive bargaining representative? Why is that? Did you also raise in an earlier stage an argument that he had no private right of action? That has never been litigated? Mr. Messenger, do I understand the structure of your argument to be as follows: That whether before certification or afterwards in a collective bargaining agreement along the lines that Justice Scalia said, the only thing that an employer can promise a union or agree to provide to a union are things that are specifically authorized in other parts of the labor law? Is that the structure of your argument? You see, I would have thought that the premise and the policies of the labor laws are to encourage a wide variety of employer/employee agreements, both things that are listed in the labor laws, that are provided for in the labor laws, but many things that are not; that the idea is to get these parties together to reach agreements on a wide variety of things that matter to them regardless whether the labor law specifically refers to that. It seems sort of turning the whole thing on its head to say that the only things that are allowed in terms of promises, whether in a collective bargaining agreement or prior to that, are the things that the law itself requires. So, Mr. Messenger, just to make sure I understand that, you're saying that regardless of whether there was a bargain in this case, forget the bargain. Let's just say that there was an employer. This employer said, you know, I think that my employees should have a right to listen to you and to decide for themselves whether they want to be represented by -- by the union, so I'm inviting the union onto my premises. Just simple as that. You're saying that the employer cannot do that. But we -- we don't need this. I mean, you say-- --of course, this is important to the union, so your argument is that it falls within the statute, regardless of whether there's any consideration or quid pro quo. I'm sorry. So this is to say that the National Labor Relations Act prohibits employers from providing access to their premises, from granting a union a list of employees, or from declaring itself neutral as to a union election. Mr. Messenger, suppose that there was a -- a union and it was striking. And the union goes to the employer and -- and they reach agreement, and the agreement is the union will stop striking if the employer agrees to sit down and negotiate with the union. So that's the promise that the employer makes to the union. I'm going to sit down and negotiate with you. And that's, obviously, a thing of important value to the union. Is that also prohibited? There's no thing that's given to the union? I mean, I would think if your argument is thing of value is anything that's of value, there's nothing that's of greater value to the union than an employer's agreement to negotiate. Well, I guess -- I mean, we're going to negotiate about all kinds of things, things -- things that unions and employers negotiate about, and that's of great benefit to the union. The union gets to turn around to all its employees and say: Look at this, the employer is going to sit down and talk with us. Mr. Messenger, would your argument apply to the following? I'm just going to give you a few different kinds of promises. A promise to give the union information about the company and its finances? But not if not during collective bargaining? I'm sure it does. An agreement giving the union a role in grievance procedures? Could you explain that distinction to me, ultimately go to the employee? I mean, I assume that everything that the union does, the union is saying, well, ultimately the benefits go to the employee. But the union, on the ones that you say, well, the neutrality agreements, the access, that's just to the union, the union can turn around and say: No, ultimately it's to the employee, that we're going to represent the employees well. So the line you're drawing seems quite inadministrable to me. Okay, so the-- --No, please. Yes, but my hypothetical is the thing, was the union's role in grievance procedures. So the union gets it, right? Well, I guess I'll tell you that a union that can say that it has a role in grievance procedures is, that's an important thing for a union to be able to tell its employees. That's of real value to the union to have that. How about -- how about if a company gives a union a role in company decision-making, any kind, hiring, any other kind of company decision-making? The company says, we want the union to participate in this. Mr. Messenger, the Excelsior rule, if I understand it correctly, the NLRB says that an employer absolutely has to give a list of employees-- --to the union seven days after an election is called; is that correct? Okay, okay. But the union gets it seven days after? And that's by requirement. So you're suggesting that if the employer gives it six days after, that's not only not required, that's forbidden? So it goes within a period of 24 hours, something that no employer can do voluntarily to something that has to be done. ",in the typical case how important be an agreement like this to the union how much do it increase the likelihood that the union will be select as the exclusive bargaining representative why be that do you also raise in an early stage an argument that he have no private right of action that have never be litigate mr messenger do i understand the structure of your argument to be as follow that

right to listen to you and to decide for themselves whether they want to be represent by by the union so I be invite the union onto my premise just simple as that you be say that the employer can not

tell its employee that be of real value to the union to have that how about how about if a company give a union a role in company decision making any kind hiring any other kind of company decision

the union seven day after an election be call be that correct okay okay but the union get it seven day after and that be by requirement so you be suggest that if the employer give it six day after

2013,Heimeshoff v. Hartford Life & Accident Insurance Co.,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Wessler, this just I think follows up on Justice Kennedy's question, but have you identified any cases in which this serves to prevent somebody from bringing a suit? But it seems as though those courts have been pretty liberal in saying, whenever it is necessary, no, take a little bit more time. So it seems just a little bit like a solution in search of a problem. What evidence do you have that any bad incentives -- you know, any bad effects are actually flowing from this? There's actually a big leeway in this statute, because it's 3 years. The administrative review process only takes about a year. Even if this is a -- it's a complicated case where there's some tolling, you know, maybe it gets you up to another year; you still have a year. I mean, what -- how would people behave badly or behave in ways that you think would disrupt the statutory scheme, if we just let everything stay as it is? I guess one question is: If you think that you do have authority and you think that the majority rule has been creating problems, why the Department of Labor hasn't done that? Ms. Carroll, what would you think if the State here just amended its statutes tomorrow and said not 3 years but 18 months? So for everybody, it's an 18-month period. It doesn't give people very long after the 12 or 13 months of the administrative review process is over. What should a court do then? Should a court strike the entire statute? Yes. Should the court say, that's unreasonable, that goes too far? I'm sorry. You know what? Take it out of the statute context. Just say that the contract said 18 months rather -- so -- so that's really what I meant. What is -- what's a court to do with a contract that says that? Well, but in 18 months. And so 18 -- the administrative review process takes about 12 months in most cases. Is 18 months enough? Well, what's the rule of law -- what's the rule of law that allows to get rid of a contract provision that's set at 14 months or 15 months or 16 months and to leave this one? I was thinking that I would like to -- like, 14 months would just seem unreasonable to me. Ms. Carroll, please tell me if I'm wrong. But even if a contract does not have an exhaustion requirement, courts have required exhaustion. And courts have required it even though the statute doesn't say so. It's an extra-textual requirement the courts have made up, irrespective of what the contract provides. I think what Justice Breyer was suggesting, that maybe, given that we have this sort of judge-made rule of exhaustion, that the courts just did sort of a half job of it, that they also should have put the statute of limitations that makes that exhaustion requirement work, and that ensures that it doesn't produce unfair, bad outcomes. The Congress was dealing -- you know, Congress passed ERISA before this exhaustion requirement came into play. So it's a little bit hard to read into anything, to read Congress's silence in the normal way here, because Congress didn't think that there was going to be this exhaustion requirement-- --and the courts put it on later. ",mr wessler this just i think follow up on justice kennedy s question but have you identify any case in which this serve to prevent somebody from bring a suit but it seem as though those court have be pretty liberal in say whenever it be necessary no take a little bit more time so it seem just a little bit like a solution in search of a problem what evidence do you have that any bad incentive you know any bad effect be actually flow from this there be actually a big leeway in this statute because it be year the administrative review process only take about a year even if this be a it be a complicated case where there be some tolling you know maybe it get you up to another year you still have a year i mean what how would people behave badly or behave in way that you think would disrupt the statutory scheme if we just let everything stay as it be i guess one question be if you think that you do have authority and you think that the majority rule have be create problem why the department of labor have not do that ms carroll what would you think if the state here just amend its statute tomorrow and say not year but month so for everybody it be an month period it do not give people very long after the or month of the administrative review process be over what should a court do then should a court strike the entire statute yes should the court say that be unreasonable that go too far I be sorry you know what take it out of the statute context just say that the contract say month rather so so that be really what i mean what be what be a court to do with a contract that say that well but in month and so the administrative review process take about month in most case be month enough well what be the rule of law what be the rule of law that allow to get rid of a contract provision that be set at month or month or month and to leave this one i be think that i would like to like month would just seem unreasonable to me ms carroll please tell me if I be wrong but even if a contract do not have an exhaustion requirement court have require exhaustion and court have require it even though the statute do not say so it be an extra textual requirement the court have make up irrespective of what the contract provide i think what justice breyer be suggest that maybe give that we have this sort of judge make rule of exhaustion that the court just do sort of a half job of it that they also should have put the statute of limitation that make that exhaustion requirement work and that ensure that it do not produce unfair bad outcome the congress be deal you know congress pass erisa before this exhaustion requirement come into play so it be a little bit hard to read into anything to read congress s silence in the normal way here because congress do not think that there be go to be this exhaustion requirement and the court put it on later ,172.22,Roberts Court,"Oct 15, 2013",Julie Heimeshoff,Hartford Life & Accident Insurance Co. and Walmart Stores,12-729,"Apr 15, 2013","Dec 16, 2013",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2013,"Pom Wonderful, LLC v. The Coca-Cola Company",114,Elena Kagan,"Justice Kennedy's question, I think, was different. He said, suppose that it said you are required to use this label and only this label, then you would acknowledge that there is an impossibility issue; is that right? Why isn't there a different kind of conflict here? Let's just focus on the name, which is what the solicitor general says the FDA has considered and has specifically permitted. They went through this very long and involved process, and they decided exactly what kind of names were permitted for this kind of product and what were not permitted, because they constituted misbranding. And essentially the FDA has said, This is what counts as misbranding, nothing else counts as misbranding. And now you're coming in and under a Lanham Act claim saying, no, the FDA is wrong. This is misbranding. That seems -- why isn't that a problem? Yeah. That the FDA said it's not misbranding, you're saying it is misbranding. That seems a quite direct conflict as to what the FDA says versus what you are alleging under the Lanham Act. Well, just hypothetically, let's say that the FDA said that this name was not misbranding, that this name was fine under their regulations, that they did not count as misbranding. Right. So I understand that, you would have some claims about different parts of the label. But I'm only asking about your claiming as -- your claim as to the specific thing that the FDA ruled on. Ms. Sherry, you know, there is no irreconcilable conflict if we view what the FDA has done as just setting a floor. And you talk a lot about how, oh, the FDA specifically considered this and it decided not to do this. You put a lot of emphasis on process. And I guess my question to you is, is that the way you are saying we should know whether the FDA has only set a floor or instead has also set a ceiling, that we're supposed to look to the process and figure out whether the FDA specifically rejected a more extensive proposal, a more aggressive proposal? Well, I guess I don't understand that. Why wouldn't it complement? You've said here is the floor to make it not misleading, but, you know, we are not saying that there are some things that, you know, wouldn't mislead a lot of consumers anyway, and then the Lanham Act can come in and supplement that and really put us in a position where nothing is misleading at all. Well, why can't it be? I mean, there are plenty of statutes which say you can't bring State law or Federal law claims. Congress knows how to do that. And instead, it said you can only not bring State law claims. They just say no claims or no -- notwithstanding any law to the contrary. Ms. Sullivan, can I ask -- if this gets you away from the argument you want to make, I apologize for that. But suppose we thought that the preemption provision here was utterly irrelevant, that it applies to state law and not Federal law, and that you can't go around broadening the statute just because the purposes behind that statute might be thought to apply to something else. So suppose I just put that aside. Do you still have any kind of argument? Do you think, Ms. Sullivan, that there are any Lanham suits regarding food labels that are allowable? But, Mr. Waxman, I think Ms. Sherry said that the FDA views itself as having a job beyond health and safety, that they view themselves as least -- not thinking about competitors' welfare or lack thereof, but at least thinking about consumer understanding of labels. So if that's the case, is the determination under the Lanham Act different from the determination under the FDCA?

2013,Riley v. California,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Fisher, would there be exigencies that would allow police to look at cell phones? And if so, what would those exigencies be? Mr. Dumont, on your argument and on the government's -- the Solicitor General's principal argument, too, a person can be arrested for anything. A person can be arrested for driving without a seat belt. And the police could take that phone and could look at every single e-mail that person has written, including work e-mails, including e-mails to family members, very intimate communications, could look at all that person's bank records, could look at all that person's medical data, could look at that person's calendar, could look at that person's GPS and find out every place that person had been recently because that person was arrested for driving without a seat belt. Now, that strikes me as a very different kind of world than the kind of world that you were describing where somebody has pictures of their family in a billfold. Doesn't it strike you that way? I don't know why this is a marginal case. Your argument and the Solicitor General's principal argument applies to any arrest. And it applies to everything on a cell phone. People carry their entire lives on cell phones. That's not a marginal case. That's the world we live in, isn't it? Well, Mr. Dumont, I guess what I'm trying to suggest to you is that you call it marginal, but, in fact, most people now do carry their lives on cell phones, and that will only grow every single year as, you know, young people take over the world. [Laughter] I mean, that's not a marginal case. That's what -- they're computers. They have as much computing capacity as -- as laptops did five years ago. And -- and everybody under a certain age, let's say under 40, has everything on them. Well, suppose I'm carrying my laptop in my backpack. Well, I don't understand that, Mr. Dumont. Everything-- --Mr. Dumont-- --Mr. Dumont, I guess I just don't understand. You said if it could be. I mean, everything could be reduced to a piece of paper. All your bank records, you could have them on you. All your medical records, you could just happen to have them on you. I mean, that would be so of absolutely everything, wouldn't it? Well, I think that the notion that you could get them legally in some other way has never justified an illegal search otherwise. Mr. Dumont, is -- are you saying, essentially, that nobody has any expectation of privacy, or that somebody has a dramatically reduced expectation of privacy in anything that the person actually wants to keep on them at all times? In other words, one has to keep one's cell phone at home to have an expectation of privacy in it? Can I ask you a question about that, Mr. Dreeben, because given the variety of things that these cell phones have in them, it seems as though that's -- you know, it sounds good as a limiting principle, but it ends up you can imagine in every case that the police could really look at everything. So I'll give you an example. It's sort of like this case. Somebody is arrested for a gun crime and now we're going to look at all the various things that might be related to a gun crime. So whether he's bought guns, whether -- you know, what -- what -- whether he's done searches for gun stores. His e-mails might something say something about gun possession or gun purchase. He might have photographs of him with a gun. You know, the whole range of things could relate to that crime, couldn't it? Well, they would be looking at the same things, but the whole idea of a warrant is that a neutral magistrate tells you that you can look at those things and has an opportunity to limit it in whatever way the neutral magistrate feels is appropriate-- --and that's a protection. But I thought the whole ideas of smartphones, Mr. Dreeben, and increasingly so, was that even the user doesn't know what's on the cloud or not.

2013,CTS Corp. v. Waldburger,114,Elena Kagan,"Why would it have wanted to do that and not also get rid of the statute of repose? I mean, presumably the idea is you should have some chance to sue after you've discovered the injury and the cause of the injury. And if here, the statute of repose is preventing that, why would Congress have wanted to modify a statute of limitations but not get rid of the statute of repose? But, Mr. Murray, in Justice Scalia's example, what in the text would prevent you from treating that -- the single statute, which is written as a statute of repose, what in the text is preventing you from saying that the statute applies to it? Right. But I think you're -- you're messing with the hypothetical now. I mean, assume that the statute of repose is all there is. Now, in fact, you're not going to get any suits because nobody is going to know that they're injured until they know that they're injured. But why wouldn't that be the commencement date is the thing that triggers the statute of repose, the last act or omission, and -- and the applicable limitations period is the 10 years? Well, but in general, Mr. Murray, I think Justice Scalia is right, that, in general, Congress hasn't made this distinction. In general, this Court has not made this distinction. In general, I think this goes back to -- to Justice Ginsburg's point. The purpose behind this law, clearly, it doesn't matter either -- I mean, either way. If Congress wanted to make sure that people could sue after discovering their injury, a statute of repose prevents that, as well as a statute of limitations does. And yet you are asking us to imagine a Congress that has this very much in -- in its head, both the difference between these two things, and you said the reason that they wanted only to alter the one and not to alter the other is because they thought of the statute of repose as impinging on a State's constitutional prerogatives. Now, that's a very legally sophisticated Congress you're asking us to imagine. [Laughter] You know, to understand this distinction and then to say, oh, yes, look, the statute of repose is really an interference with substantive liability in a way that the statute of limitations is not and that might raise constitutional avoidance issues. I mean, I think that's -- that's -- that's pretty sophisticated stuff. I think what -- at least what I take from Justice Scalia's question is that if you think of the -- if you imagine -- and you're quite right that this doesn't exist in the real world -- but if you imagine a statute of repose existing independently, it actually would fit the language of this statute quite, you know, fine. The commencement date would be different. It would not be the date of accrual. It would be the date of the defendant's last act, but still the statute would work perfectly well. And I suppose if you think that, then -- then in a case in which there was both, the question would be why wouldn't you just apply this statute to both? Mr. Palmore, what do you think the commencement date in this case was? But how could that be the beginning of the period during which his suit may be brought? I mean, he couldn't bring suit on that date. It seems something sort of internally contradictory in your interpretation here. Do you -- is your understanding of the operation of this statute is the applicable limitations period -- do you see the statute as applying seriatim first to the statute of limitations and then to the statute of repose, or is the applicable limitations period the period that you can sue when you combine those two? No, here. Yes, I just want to know how do you apply this statute to what we have here? Is there a single applicable limitations period which represents the period when, given both clauses, you can sue, or are you saying that there are two applicable limitations periods? But I mean, I take it, Mr. Korzen, that your argument is a little bit different. I mean, it seems Justice Scalia would have a point if it just said if the limitations period. Your argument is that you put in the word ‶ applicable ″ and it actually makes the statute read a little bit differently. It suggests that there are plural limitations period and the one that this provision applies to is whichever one happens to be applicable as you apply the provision. But it seems an awfully strange way to abolish a repose period, right? I mean, one way to abolish a repose period is just to abolish a repose period. Another way is to say what Congress seems to have said here, which is move the first date of the period of repose up to a new Federal commencement date so that the period of repose wholly -- is wholly redundant as to the limitations period. Now, that's a kind of strange way to do a pretty simple thing, isn't it? ",why would it have want to do that and not also get rid of the statute of repose i mean presumably the idea be you should have some chance to sue after you have discover the injury and the because of the injury and if here the statute of repose be prevent that why would congress have want to modify a statute of limitation but not get rid of the statute of repose but mr murray in justice scalia s example what in the text would prevent you from treat that the single statute which be write as a statute of repose what in the text be prevent you from say that the statute apply to it right but i think you be you be mess with the hypothetical now i mean assume that the statute of repose be all there be now in fact you be not go to get any suit because nobody be go to know that they be injure until they know that they be injure but why would not that be the commencement date be the thing that trigger the statute of repose the last act or omission and and the applicable limitation period be the year well but in general mr murray i think justice scalia be right that in general congress have not make this distinction in general this court have not make this distinction in general i think this go back to to justice ginsburg s point the purpose behind this law clearly it do not matter either i mean either way if congress want to make sure that people could sue after discover their injury a statute of repose prevents that as well as a statute of limitation do and yet you be ask us to imagine a congress that have this very much in in its head both the difference between these two thing and you say the reason that they want only to alter the one and not to alter the other be because they think of the statute of repose as impinge on a state s constitutional prerogative now that be a very legally sophisticated congress you be ask us to imagine laughter you know to understand this distinction and then to say oh yes look the statute of repose be really an interference with substantive liability in a way that the statute of limitation be not and that might raise constitutional avoidance issue i mean i think that be that be that be pretty sophisticated stuff i think what at least what i take from justice scalia s question be that if you think of the if you imagine and you be quite right that this do not exist in the real world but if you imagine a statute of repose exist independently it actually would fit the language of this statute quite you know fine the commencement date would be different it would not be the date of accrual it would be the date of the defendant s last act but still the statute would work perfectly well and i suppose if you think that then then in a case in which there be both the question would be why would not you just apply this statute to both mr palmore what do you think the commencement date in this case be but how could that be the beginning of the period during which his suit may be bring i mean he could not bring suit on that date it seem something sort of internally contradictory in your interpretation here do you be your understanding of the operation of this statute be the applicable limitation period do you see the statute as apply seriatim first to the statute of limitation and then to the statute of repose or be the applicable limitation period the period that you can sue when you combine those two no here yes i just want to know how do you apply this statute to what we have here be there a single applicable limitation period which represent the period when give both clause you can sue or be you say that there be two applicable limitation period but i mean i take it mr korzen that your argument be a little bit different i mean it seem justice scalia would have a point if it just say if the limitation period your argument be that you put in the word applicable and it actually make the statute read a little bit differently it suggest that there be plural limitation period and the one that this provision apply to be whichever one happen to be applicable as you apply the provision but it seem an awfully strange way to abolish a repose period right i mean one way to abolish a repose period be just to abolish a repose period another way be to say what congress seem to have say here which be move the first date of the period of repose up to a new federal commencement date so that the period of repose wholly be wholly redundant as to the limitation period now that be a kind of strange way to do a pretty simple thing be not it ,281.36999999999995,Roberts Court,"Apr 23, 2014",CTS Corp.,"Peter Waldberger, et al.",13-339,"Jan 10, 2014","Jun 9, 2014",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2013,Limelight Networks v. Akamai Technologies,114,Elena Kagan,"And, Mr. Panner, if they did reach it a second time around and they decided well, now that this inducement theory is not available to us, we think that there is a real problem here, that there is a kind of end run around the patent law and so we're going to change what we think on the 271(a) question, if they did that, it would be right to say it would render our opinion on the 271(b) question a nullity? Yes. I guess the question I'm asking -- I mean, I can't think of a way in which our decision on the 271(b) question would be relevant for any case if the Federal Circuit on remand goes the opposite way in a -- on the 271(a) question. But maybe I'm not thinking more broadly enough. Yes. I suppose I just couldn't think of a place where somebody would make the 271(b) claim if the 271(a) claim were available to it. But I suppose, Mr. Panner, what might make this a little bit different is that notwithstanding what you said about 10 of 11 judges, it was clear that the judges thought that there was a real problem here in terms of an end run, and that they looked at this and said, well we could do it under 271(a) or we could do it under 271(b), and 271(b) seems a lot more natural and better for various reasons. But your sense in reading the opinion that all those judges who did it under 271(b) are just going to go back and do the exact same thing under 271(a). But in some ways that's why the Federal Circuit did what it did, right? I mean, you can look at the Federal Circuit's ruling and say it makes no sense. How can you induce infringement if there's no infringement in the first place. And that's a very strong argument. But the reason they put this under 271(b) rather than under 271(a) is because of what Justice Scalia said, that 271(b) is not a strict liability offense, and so that you can say, you have to know and you have to have instructed the -- the person. So, you know, they thought that they were being very clever by putting it into a 271(b) box and avoiding the strict liability consequences of what they were doing, but also avoiding the possibility of an end run of the patent law. There is that problem. There is -- There is that problem. [Laughter] And-- --And, Mr. Waxman, if -- if -- if we say something about the 271(a) question here, I mean, it does seem as though it's sandbagging Limelight. Limelight did not brief this until you briefed it, so we have part of Limelight's reply brief. None of the amicus knew -- the amici knew that it was in the case until you briefed the 271 issue. So that would seem a real problem in getting to the 271 issue here. That-- --Mr. Waxman, I think it's a very different situation. I mean, in that case it's clear that there was a kidnapping. It happened to be a kidnapping done by four people rather than a kidnapping done by one person. But there was a kidnapping. Now, in your case, I don't think you can say the same thing because the question is: Is there an infringement? Under Federal Circuit law, there is no infringement when different people do these different steps of the process. That's just the fact of the matter. But I think again, Mr. Waxman, what -- what -- what your argument just glides over is did you need the infringement. And the question is whether, under substantive law, you have the infringement when different people do different steps of the process. And as I understand the Federal Circuit's law in this area, it's that you don't have any infringement when different people do different steps of the process. So that takes you back to the 271(a) question, which you think is wrong, but if it's right, you just don't have an argument in the 271(b) question. ",and mr panner if they do reach it a second time around and they decide well now that this inducement theory be not available to us we think that there be a real problem here that there be a kind of end run around the patent law and so we be go to change what we think on the a question if they do that it would be right to say it would render our opinion on the b question a nullity yes i guess the question I be ask i mean i can not think of a way in which our decision on the b question would be relevant for any case if the federal circuit on remand go the opposite way in a on the a question but maybe I be not think more broadly enough yes i suppose i just could not think of a place where somebody would make the b claim if the a claim we be available to it but i suppose mr panner what might make this a little bit different be that notwithstanding what you say about of judge it be clear that the judge think that there be a real problem here in term of an end run and that they look at this and say well we could do it under a or we could do it under b and b seem a lot more natural and good for various reason but your sense in read the opinion that all those judge who do it under b be just go to go back and do the exact same thing under a but in some way that be why the federal circuit do what it do right i mean you can look at the federal circuit s ruling and say it make no sense how can you induce infringement if there be no infringement in the first place and that be a very strong argument but the reason they put this under b rather than under a be because of what justice scalia say that b be not a strict liability offense and so that you can say you have to know and you have to have instruct the the person so you know they think that they we be be very clever by put it into a b box and avoid the strict liability consequence of what they we be do but also avoid the possibility of an end run of the patent law there be that problem there be there be that problem laughter and and mr waxman if if if we say something about the a question here i mean it do seem as though it be sandbag limelight limelight do not brief this until you brief it so we have part of limelight s reply brief none of the amicus know the amici know that it be in the case until you brief the issue so that would seem a real problem in get to the issue here that mr waxman i think it be a very different situation i mean in that case it be clear that there be a kidnapping it happen to be a kidnap do by four people rather than a kidnap do by one person but there be a kidnapping now in your case i do not think you can say the same thing because the question be be there an infringement under federal circuit law there be no infringement when different people do these different step of the process that be just the fact of the matter but i think again mr waxman what what what your argument just glide over be do you need the infringement and the question be whether under substantive law you have the infringement when different people do different step of the process and as i understand the federal circuit s law in this area it be that you do not have any infringement when different people do different step of the process so that take you back to the a question which you think be wrong but if it be right you just do not have an argument in the b question ,228.26999999999995,Roberts Court,"Apr 30, 2014",Limelight Networks,Akamai Technologies,12-786,"Jan 10, 2014","Jun 2, 2014",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2013,Bond v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"But the convention -- but the convention tells the State parties, go regulate individual conduct in exactly the way that this convention regulates State parties. And then what the legislation does is, as Justice Ginsburg said, just mirror the convention as the convention contemplated. Do you think -- do you think, Mr. Clement, and this goes back to Justice Ginsburg's question, could the -- could this treaty have itself regulated individual conduct? Could the treaty have been self-executing? Where would you find that in the Constitution? Because there's clearly a treaty power that does not have subject matter limitations. And, indeed, if you go back to the founding history, it's very clear that they thought about all kinds of subject matter limitations and James Madison and others decided, quite self-consciously, not to impose them. So where would you find that limitation in the Constitution? But this isn't an enumerated power. The enumerated power is the treaty power. So you have to find a constraint on the treaty power. Where does it come from? Mr. Clement, could I make sure I understand your test? Your test is to say that with respect to every prosecution under this -- under this treaty, that a court has to ask whether the prosecution has a sufficient nexus to national or international concerns? Is that -- is that your test? Well, I guess I'm still looking for a test and I thought that the test that I just articulated was really directly out of your briefs. But if it's -- but if -- if you're suggesting that that's not the test, give me the test that we're supposed to ask with respect to this case or any other as to whether the prosecution is unconstitutional. That sounds like a facial challenge. Now, I thought that you made very careful to talk about that this was an as-applied challenge to this particular prosecution. So you're saying if the statute extends to things that we've generally thought of as part of the police power, that's sufficient. Okay. Nexus, nexus to a national concern, again, is what I understood you to say in your brief. But let me give you a hypothetical and you tell me whether your test meets it. Let's say it's the same convention except it relates only to Sarin gas, and -- and there's a chemist out there and, you know, the -- the implementing legislation mirrors the convention. There's a chemist out there who manufactures Sarin gas -- I take it it's pretty easy to manufacture -- and sends it through the ducts of a house and kills everybody in it. Does that have a nexus to national concerns? So but this is -- in my hypothetical -- and you didn't run away from it at all; I applaud that. In my hypothetical, it's a completely domestic use. You know, it's just this chemist didn't like his neighbor and used Sarin gas. And you're saying what the difference is, well, what the treaty makers did was to find the category of chemicals more broadly. And I guess what I want to know is, you are imagining a world in which judges day to day try to get inside the head of treaty makers to think about, you know, in this case we understand that there's a national interest in regulating Sarin gas, but we don't think that there's a sufficient interest in regulating some other chemical or some other chemical or so on down the line. It seems to me a completely indeterminate test and one that would have judges take the place of treaty makers in terms of deciding what is in the national and international interest. Well, but, Mr. Clement, it's absolutely clear that the treaty was after enforcement as to individuals with respect to all the prohibitions, that the treaty said: Go enforce this as to individuals and do it consistent with your constitutional processes. And then Congress passes a law that is consistent with its constitutional processes, and it completely mirrors the treaty. I guess I'm still trying to figure out why. I mean, Holmes dealt with this in Missouri v. Holland. He says there's a treaty power, it's an enumerated power, there's a necessary and proper clause that functions to -- to allow Congress to give effect to that treaty power. It's -- you know, this is a -- a situation where there's a prohibition on the States in terms of entering into treaties or in terms of sharing that power in any way. And he says, you know, it's just these invisible radiations that you think come from the structure of the Constitution. And he specifically rejected this argument, the same argument that you're making, the penumbras and emanations of the Constitution. Well, General, could I ask why that is? I mean, because this -- this Convention and the implementing legislation is very broad and it's broad because it applies to a very large category of weapons and it applies to a very large category of uses, of conduct. So what were they thinking about, about why they wanted these very broad categories, why it's not more limited with respect either to the chemicals or to the conduct? And, General, don't we have an amicus brief from almost all of the legal counsels of the State Department, Republican and Democrat, talking about how if Petitioner's argument were accepted, it would severely damage the United States' ability to enter into and to negotiate treaties. Can I just ask you, Mr. Clement, and it's a variant of the hypothetical I gave you before, but it focuses more on your statutory point, the peaceful purposes. Suppose that Ms. Bond used sarin gas and sent it through the ducts of Haynes' house; would you say that that's a peaceful purpose? ",but the convention but the convention tell the state party go regulate individual conduct in exactly the way that this convention regulate state party and then what the legislation do be as justice ginsburg say just mirror the convention as the convention contemplate do you think do you think mr clement and this go back to justice ginsburg s question could the could this treaty have itself regulate individual conduct could the treaty have be self execute where would you find that in the constitution because there be clearly a treaty power that do not have subject matter limitation and indeed if you go back to the founding history it be very clear that they think about all kind of subject matter limitation and james madison and others decide quite self consciously not to impose them so where would you find that limitation in the constitution but this be not an enumerated power the enumerated power be the treaty power so you have to find a constraint on the treaty power where do it come from mr clement could i make sure i understand your test your test be to say that with respect to every prosecution under this under this treaty that a court have to ask whether the prosecution have a sufficient nexus to national or international concern be that be that your test well i guess I be still look for a test and i think that the test that i just articulate be really directly out of your brief but if it be but if if you be suggest that that be not the test give me the test that we be suppose to ask with respect to this case or any other as to whether the prosecution be unconstitutional that sound like a facial challenge now i think that you make very careful to talk about that this be an as applied challenge to this particular prosecution so you be say if the statute extend to thing that we have generally think of as part of the police power that be sufficient okay nexus nexus to a national concern again be what i understood you to say in your brief but let me give you a hypothetical and you tell me whether your test meet it let us say it be the same convention except it relate only to sarin gas and and there be a chemist out there and you know the the implementing legislation mirror the convention there be a chemist out there who manufacture sarin gas i take it it be pretty easy to manufacture and send it through the duct of a house and kill everybody in it do that have a nexus to national concern so but this be in my hypothetical and you do not run away from it at all i applaud that in my hypothetical it be a completely domestic use you know it be just this chemist do not like his neighbor and use sarin gas and you be say what the difference be well what the treaty maker do be to find the category of chemical more broadly and i guess what i want to know be you be imagine a world in which judge day to day try to get inside the head of treaty maker to think about you know in this case we understand that there be a national interest in regulate sarin gas but we do not think that there be a sufficient interest in regulate some other chemical or some other chemical or so on down the line it seem to me a completely indeterminate test and one that would have judge take the place of treaty maker in term of decide what be in the national and international interest well but mr clement it be absolutely clear that the treaty be after enforcement as to individual with respect to all the prohibition that the treaty say go enforce this as to individual and do it consistent with your constitutional process and then congress pass a law that be consistent with its constitutional process and it completely mirror the treaty i guess I be still try to figure out why i mean holmes dealt with this in missouri v holland he say there be a treaty power it be an enumerated power there be a necessary and proper clause that function to to allow congress to give effect to that treaty power it be you know this be a a

from the structure of the constitution and he specifically reject this argument the same argument that you be make the penumbra and emanation of the constitution well general could i ask why that be i mean because this this convention and the implementing legislation be very broad and it be broad because it apply to a very large category of weapon and it apply to a very large category of us of conduct so what we be they think about about why they want these very broad category why it be not more limited with respect either to the chemical or to the conduct and general do not we have an amicus brief from almost all of the legal counsel of the state department republican and democrat talk about how if petitioner s argument we be accept it would severely damage the united state ability to enter into and to negotiate treaty can i just ask you mr clement and it be a variant of the hypothetical i give you before but it focus more on your statutory point the peaceful purpose suppose

2013,Alice Corporation v. CLS Bank International,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Phillips, could you -- could you disaggregate your argument for me? Because you just said, look, this Court has said it's not sufficient if you have an idea and then you say use a computer to implement it; right? So are you saying that your -- that -- are you saying that you're doing more than saying use a computer to implement it or are you saying that it's -- that the idea itself is more than an idea? Which part of what-- --So putting the computer stuff aside completely-- --you're saying that you've invented something or you-- --There is something that you've patented that has -- that is not just simple use a third party to do a settlement. And what is that, putting the computer aside? Well, how are you saying the how? Because I thought that your computers -- that your patents really did just say do this on a computer, as opposed to saying anything substantive about how to do it on a computer. Can I give you a hypothetical, Mr. Phillips, and you tell me how it's different or the same. Let's say, you know, 30 years somebody took a look around the world and said, a lot of people seem to order products by mail. They get the catalogues in the mail and then they send back their return forms. And let's say that one of the founders of the Internet said, wouldn't this be an amazing system, we could actually do this by computer, and they had patented that. Is that the same? No, but exactly. I mean, the claim would have said something along the lines of, you know, there's this process by which people order products and we want to do it over the Internet, we want to do it electronically, and we will use a computer to do that, to essentially take the process of mail order catalogues and make it electronic. Mr. Perry, before we get back to these matters, you said to Justice Scalia if a patent sufficiently describes how a computer will implement an idea then it's patentable. So how sufficiently does one have to describe it? What do we want a judge to do at this threshold level in terms of trying to figure out whether the description is sufficient to get you past it? You're not suggesting that specific code is necessary? Should we be concerned, Mr. Perry, that there are old patents that in fact could meet the test that you set forth but won't because they were written in a different time and so used much more general language? ",mr phillips could you could you disaggregate your argument for me because you just say look this court have say it be not sufficient if you have an idea and then you say use a computer to implement it right so be you say that your that be you say that you be do more than say use a computer to implement it or be you say that it be that the idea itself be more than an idea which part of what so put the computer stuff aside completely you be say that you have invent something or you there be something that you have patent that have that be not just simple use a third party to do a settlement and what be that put the computer aside well how be you say the how because i think that your computer that your patent really do just say do this on a computer as oppose to say anything substantive about how to do it on a computer can i give you a hypothetical mr phillips and you tell me how it be different or the same let us say you know year somebody take a look around the world and say a lot of people seem to order product by mail they get the catalogue in the mail and then they send back their return form and let us say that one of the founder of the internet say would not this be an amazing system we could actually do this by computer and they have patent that be that the same no but exactly i mean the claim would have say something along the line of you know there be this process by which people order product and we want to do it over the internet we want to do it electronically and we will use a computer to do that to essentially take the process of mail order catalogue and make it electronic mr perry before we get back to these matter you say to justice scalia if a patent sufficiently describe how a computer will implement an idea then it be patentable so how sufficiently do one have to describe it what do we want a judge to do at this threshold level in term of try to figure out whether the description be sufficient to get you past it you be not suggest that specific code be necessary should we be concern mr perry that there be old patent that in fact could meet the test that you set forth but will not because they we be write in a different time and so used much more general language ,152.36,Roberts Court,"Mar 31, 2014",Alice Corporation Pty.

2013,Scialabba v. Cuellar De Osorio,114,Elena Kagan,"Ms. Goldenberg, before you do that, could I just ask you to respond to a sort of different hypothesis of what Congress was up to here and tell me what, if anything, you think follows from it? Assume you think that Congress actually was not intending this very small category, that Congress was intending for this to be a pretty wide provision, but what Congress was -- it was laboring under a misapprehension. I mean, it thought that you could do this kind of automatic conversion with respect to all of these people, and it turns out Congress was just utterly wrong on that. So -- but Congress includes this language about automatic conversion. So what do I do if I basically have a hunch that that's what Congress was thinking, but yet the language that it adopted talks about automatic conversion, which is impossible for many of this category. I understand that argument, but that's not the argument that Wang made, is it? Wang suggested that if the -- the appropriate date was at the very date of aging out. So -- so it seems as though you shouldn't be entitled to Chevron deference on that question, given what Wang said about it. I'm sorry. Please. In the usual case, a petitioner has to show a bunch of things, right? You have to come in and say, I'm a legal permanent resident, and, you know, I file an affidavit of support and show that you haven't committed any offenses against minors and all of this stuff, right? But you're suggesting that we can just ignore all of those requirements that usually have to be shown at the threshold for a petition to be accepted; isn't that right? Mr. Fleming, to accept that argument, don't you have to accept your understanding of what the appropriate date is? I mean, let's suppose that the government is right, that the date is the one that's actually specified in the statute which says the date on which an immigrant visa number becomes available. At that date, the parent is not even going to be a legal permanent resident; isn't that right? But let's assume that this is the right date, the one that's actually specified in the statute. Can you win if that's the right date? I know, but can you win if it is the right date? Based on -- another understanding of Chevron is sometimes Congress writes confusing statutes that point in two different directions at once, and then there's a choice. Does the Court make the best of it or does the agency make the best of it? And the agency knows a lot about the subject matter, and especially this agency, and so irrespective of whether Congress meant to delegate something in some very self-conscious way, this is a confusing statute, it's a kind of the muddle. The -- the agency gets to do it. ",ms goldenberg before you do that could i just ask you to respond to a sort of different hypothesis of what congress be up to here and tell me what if anything you think follow from it assume you think that congress actually be not intend this very small category that congress be intend for this to be a pretty wide provision but what congress be it be labor under a misapprehension i mean it think that you could do this kind of automatic conversion with respect to all of these people and it turn out congress be just utterly wrong on that so but congress include this language about automatic conversion so what do i do if i basically have a hunch that that be what congress be think but yet the language that it adopt talk about automatic conversion which be impossible for many of this category i understand that argument but that be not the argument that wang make be it wang suggest that if the the appropriate date be at the very date of age out so so it seem as though you should not be entitle to chevron deference on that question give what wang say about it I be sorry please in the usual case a petitioner have to show a bunch of thing right you have to come in and say I be a legal permanent resident and you know i file an affidavit of support and show that you have not commit any offense against minor and all of this stuff right but you be suggest that we can just ignore all of those requirement that usually have to be show at the threshold for a petition to be accept be not that right mr fleming to accept that argument do not you have to accept your understanding of what the appropriate date be i mean let us suppose that the government be right that the date be the one that be actually specify in the statute which say the date on which an immigrant visa number become available at that date the parent be not even go to be a legal permanent resident be not that right but let us assume that this be the right date the one that be actually specify in the statute can you win if that be the right date i know but can you win if it be the right date base on another understanding of chevron be sometimes congress writes confuse statute that point in two different direction at once and then there be a choice do the court make the best of it or do the agency make the best of it and the agency know a lot about the subject matter and especially this agency and so irrespective of whether congress mean to delegate something in some very self conscious way this be a confusing statute it be a kind of the muddle the the agency get to do it ,153.75,Roberts Court,"Dec 10, 2013","Lori Scialabba, Acting Director, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, et al.","Rosalina Cuellar de Osorio, et al.",12-930,"Jun 24, 2013","Jun 9, 2014",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2013,Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, I mean, just take one of the things that Justice Sotomayor asked about, which is vaccinations, because there are many people who have religious objections to vaccinations. So suppose an employer does and -- and refuses to fund or wants not to fund vaccinations for her employees, what -- what happens then? Blood transfusions? So really, every medical treatment. And Justice Sotomayor is quite right that there are quite a number of medical treatments that different religious groups object to. So one religious group could opt out of this and another religious group could opt out of that and everything would be piecemeal and nothing would be uniform. Mr. Clement, isn't this a special kind of statute? Because this is a statute that specifically refers back to a body of constitutional law. It basically says we want to get right back to the place that we were with respect to religious claims before Employment Division v. Smith. And so we have -- it's not -- you know, it's a statute that directs us to a body of constitutional law. That body of constitutional law is, I think, very different from the one you portray in your brief. It suggests that accommodations should be made sometimes, but rarely, and subject to a -- to a balancing analysis, not to a compelling interest standard in the way we would use it for, say, race discrimination. So, you know, what's -- what's the response to that? Well, it is applying the statute as written. The statute as written -- this is not a question of legislative history -- the statute as written points back to pre-Smith law. It says: That's what we mean. But, again, Mr. Clement as Justice Ginsburg said, this was a very uncontroversial law. Your understanding of this law, your interpretation of it, would essentially subject the entire U.S. Code to the highest test in constitutional law, to a compelling interest standard. So another employer comes in and that employer says, I have a religious objection to sex discrimination laws; and then another employer comes in, I have a religious objection to minimum wage laws; and then another, family leave; and then another, child labor laws. And all of that is subject to the exact same test which you say is this unbelievably high test, the compelling interest standard with the least restrictive alternative. Well, she had an understanding of how the Court worked pre-Smith that was a kind of Sherbert v. Verner-Yoder understanding, which was we did a balancing, we looked at the government's interests, we took those very seriously, especially to the extent that there was harm to identifiable third parties and that it fell on an identifiable third party. That was basically -- you could not get an accommodation for that kind of harm. Well, with respect, Mr. Clement, I think that that's probably because the Court has had a different understanding of what RFRA does and the kind of analysis that it requires courts to perform than you're arguing for in this case. That if your argument were adopted and there was a strict scrutiny standard of the kind that usually applies and a least restrictive alternative requirement, then you would see religious objectors come out of the woodwork with respect to all of these laws. And because you say that there -- and I think this is absolutely right when you say it -- that you -- you cannot test the centrality of a belief to a religion, you cannot test the sincerity of religion. I think a court would be, you know -- their hands would be bound when faced with all these challenges if your standard applies. No, I don't think that that's the same thing, Mr. Clement. There's one penalty that is if the employer continues to provide health insurance without this part of the coverage, but Hobby Lobby could choose not to provide health insurance at all. And in that case Hobby Lobby would pay $2,000 per employee, which is less than Hobby Lobby probably pays to provide insurance to its employees. So there is a choice here. It's not even a penalty by -- in the language of the statute. It's a payment or a tax. There's a choice. And so the question is, why is there a substantial burden at all? No, between paying $2,000 per employee per year if Hobby Lobby does not provide-- --You know, Hobby Lobby is paying something right now for the -- for the coverage. It's less than what Hobby Lobby is paying for the coverage. There are employers all over the United States that are doing this voluntarily because they think that it's less. Well, let's say that that's right. Let's say that they have to increase the wages a little bit. I mean, still we are talking about pretty equivalent numbers. Maybe it's a little bit less; maybe it's a little bit more. But this is not the kind of thing that's going to drive a person out of business. It's not prohibitive. It's like the thing that we talked about in Braunfeld where we said, you know, maybe if the store can't stay open 7 days a week, it makes a little bit less money. But so be it, is what we said. But Mr. Clement, it's not saying you must do something that violates your religion. It's giving you a choice. You can do this thing or if this thing violates your religion you can do another thing. And that other thing is approximately the same price as the thing that you don't want to do. Can I ask-- --But, Mr. Clement, you're not saying, are you, that their religious beliefs mandate them to provide health care? I thought that you were never making that claim. You know, I'm sure they seem like very good employers. And I'm sure they want to be good employers. But again, that's a different thing than saying that their religious beliefs mandate them to provide health insurance, because here Congress has said that the health insurance that they're providing is not adequate, it's not the full package. Well, but I think even-- --that example, you know, initially Title VII did not apply to any employers with fewer than 25 employees. And then gradually, Congress brought the number down because Congress realized that there were going to be transition issues and that some time was needed to make sure that the compelling interest, you know, should be applied uniformly across all employers. I mean, Mr. Clement, isn't that just a way of saying that you think that this isn't a good statute, because it asks one person to subsidize another person. But Congress has made a judgment and Congress has given a statutory entitlement and that entitlement is to women and includes contraceptive coverage. And when the employer says, no, I don't want to give that, that woman is quite directly, quite tangibly harmed. Isn't that a merits question, General? I mean, I totally understand that argument as a -- as an argument about the merits. I'm not sure I understand it as a threshold claim that this -- that the claim is not cognizable at all. ",well i mean just take one of the thing that justice sotomayor ask about which be vaccination because there be many people who have religious objection to vaccination so suppose an employer do and and refuse to fund or want not to fund vaccination for her employee what what happen then blood transfusion so really every medical treatment and justice sotomayor be quite right that there be quite a number of medical treatment that different religious group object to so one religious group could opt out of this and another religious group could opt out of that and everything would be piecemeal and nothing would be uniform mr clement be not this a special kind of statute because this be a statute that specifically refer back to a body of constitutional law it basically say we want to get right back to the place that we we be with respect to religious claim before employment division v smith and so we have it be not you know it be a statute that direct us to a body of constitutional law that body of constitutional law be i think very different from the one you portray in your brief it suggest that accommodation should be make sometimes but rarely and subject to a to a balancing analysis not to a compelling interest standard in the way we would use it for say race discrimination so you know what be what be the response to that well it be apply the statute as write the statute as write this be not a question of legislative history the statute as write point back to pre smith law it say that be what we mean but again mr clement as justice ginsburg say this be a very uncontroversial law your understanding of this law your interpretation of it would essentially subject the entire us code to the high test in constitutional law to a compelling interest standard so another employer come in and that employer say i have a religious objection to sex discrimination law and then another employer come in i have a religious objection to minimum wage law and then another family leave and then another child labor law and all of that be subject to the exact same test which you say be this unbelievably high test the compelling interest standard with the least restrictive alternative well she have an understanding of how the court work pre smith that be a kind of sherbert v verner yoder understanding which be we do a balancing we look at the government s interest we take those very seriously especially to the extent that there be harm to identifiable third party and that it fell on an identifiable third party that be basically you could not get an accommodation for that kind of harm well with respect mr clement i think that that be probably because the court have have a different understanding of what rfra do and the kind of analysis that it require court to perform than you be argue for in this case that if your argument we be adopt and there be a strict scrutiny standard of the kind that usually apply and a least restrictive alternative requirement then you would see religious objector come out of the woodwork with respect to all of these law and because you say that there and i think this be absolutely right when you say it that you you can not test the centrality of a belief to a religion you can not test the sincerity of religion i think a court would be you know their hand would be bind when face with all these challenge if your standard applies no i do not think that that be the same thing mr clement there be one penalty that be if the employer continue to provide health insurance without this part of the coverage but hobby lobby could choose not to provide health insurance at all and in that case hobby lobby would pay per employee which be less than hobby lobby probably pay to provide insurance to its employee so there be a choice here it be not even a penalty by in the language of the statute it be a payment or a tax there be a choice and so the question be why be there a substantial burden at all no between pay per employee per year if hobby lobby do not provide you know hobby lobby be pay something right now for the for the coverage it be less than what hobby lobby be pay for the coverage there be employer all over the united state that be do this voluntarily because they think that it be less well let us say that that be right let us say that they have to increase the wage a little bit i mean still we be talk about pretty equivalent number maybe it be a little bit less maybe it be a little bit more but this be not the kind of thing that be go to drive a person out of business it be not prohibitive it be like the thing that we talk about in braunfeld where we say you know maybe if the store can not stay open day a week it make a little bit less money but so be it be what we say but mr clement it be not say you must do something that violate your religion it be give you a choice you can do this thing or if this thing violate your religion you can do another thing and that other thing be approximately the same price as the thing that you do not want to do can i ask but mr clement you be not say be you that their religious belief mandate them to provide health care i think that you we be never make that claim you know I be sure they seem like very good employer and I be sure they want to be good employer but again that be a different thing than say that their religious belief mandate them to provide health insurance because here congress have say that the health insurance that they be provide be not adequate it be not the full package well but i think even that example you know initially title vii do not apply to any employer with few than employee and then gradually congress bring the number down because congress realize that there we be go to be transition issue and that some time be need to make sure that the compelling interest you know should be apply uniformly across all employer i mean mr clement be not that just a way of say that you think that this be not a good statute because it ask one person to subsidize another person but congress have make a judgment and congress have give a statutory entitlement and that entitlement be to woman and include contraceptive coverage and when the employer say no i do not want to give that that woman be quite directly quite tangibly harm be not that a merit question general i mean i totally understand that argument as a as an argument about the merit I be not sure i understand it as a threshold claim that this that the claim be not cognizable at all ,410.5399999999999,Roberts Court,"Mar 25,

2013,United States v. Apel,114,Elena Kagan,"How do we tell that, Mr. Horwich? What's the test for determining when a place is subject to military command? But a map, presumably, reflects who owns the property, and you, yourself, say that that's not what's significant. And I took your point in your brief to suggest some kind of more functional test, is this property being used for military purposes? Am I -- am I wrong in ascribing that to you? Do you think, Mr. Horwich, that there is any point at which a military installation can lose its character as such? I mean, I'll give you an example. Suppose -- you know, that in this -- in this base area, the government -- the military decided to allow four private condo buildings and six restaurants and three movie theaters, and it really just turned into a regular old town. And -- and it entered into agreements whereby all the policing was being done by local law enforcement officers, rather than by the military. Is there any point at which it just becomes too much not like a military base, where you lose the ability to do this, even though it's under the formal command of a military officer? So what happens, for example, at -- at the school if there's an assault on school premises? Who deals with that? Federal -- I'm sorry. Is that military police or is that-- --I mean, who -- who comes in -- is it -- is it members of the military? Or is it members of the county police force? Or is it-- --Well, I guess I'm just wondering with respect to each of these places, I mean, the highway, the school, the Amtrak station, who's actually in control when something goes wrong in these places? The security forces meaning-- --the military. So do military personnel actively patrol this entire area? But I -- I had thought that, in your brief, you thought that the ownership test was both underinclusive and overinclusive. Well, Mr. Chemerinsky, does that mean-- --Well, Mr. Chemerinsky, does that mean that the -- the government could not have issued this barment order in the first place? Well, then I'm -- I'm perplexed because if the government has sufficient commanding authority to issue the barment order to say, notwithstanding that Mr. Apel had not crossed the green line, that -- you know, he just can't be here, and he's excluded, then why don't they have sufficient authority to prevent him from reentering? I see. So-- --But you're saying that if he had not crossed the green line, he could not have been excluded? And you're saying that the military cannot exclude any person from any of this area outside the green line? Your -- your argument is sort of a use it or lose it argument, is that correct? That the government has this commanding authority, unless the government uses it to its full extent every day of the week, it loses it? One of the arguments that the government makes is, look, what the military wants to do here is something very sensible. It keeps tight what it needs to keep tight, but it allows to be more open areas that can -- that it -- it doesn't have an interest in securing entirely. And that's for the convenience of military personnel. It's for the convenience of other people who live around the base. What's wrong with that? May I just ask a background question, Mr. Horwich? What's the history of this First Amendment area? What -- when did this speech area come into being? Was the litigation essentially like this one, basically saying that this was not under military command? ",how do we tell that mr horwich what be the test for determine when a place be subject to military command but a map presumably reflect who own the property and you yourself say that that be not what be significant and i take your point in your brief to suggest some kind of more functional test be this property be use for military purpose be i be i wrong in ascribe that to you do you think mr horwich that there be any point at which a military installation can lose its character as such i mean I will give you an example suppose you know that in this in this base area the government the military decide to allow four private condo building and six restaurant and three movie theater and it really just turn into a regular old town and and it enter into agreement whereby all the policing be be do by local law enforcement officer rather than by the military be there any point at which it just become too much not like a military base where you lose the ability to do this even though it be under the formal command of a military officer so what happen for example at at the school if there be an assault on school premise who deal with that federal I be sorry be that military police or be that i mean who who come in be it be it member of the military or be it member of the county police force or be it well i guess I be just wonder with respect to each of these place i mean the highway the school the amtrak station who be actually in control when something go wrong in these place the security force mean the military so do military personnel actively patrol this entire area but i i have think that in your brief you think that the ownership test be both underinclusive and overinclusive well mr chemerinsky do that mean well mr chemerinsky do that mean that the the government could not have issue this barment order in the first place well then I be I be perplexed because if the government have sufficient command authority to issue the barment order to say notwithstanding that mr apel have not cross the green line that you know he just can not be here and he be exclude then why do not they have sufficient authority to prevent him from reentering i see so but you be say that if he have not cross the green line he could not have be exclude and you be say that the military can not exclude any person from any of this area outside the green line your your argument be sort of a use it or lose it argument be that correct that the government have this commanding authority unless the government use it to its full extent every day of the week it lose it one of the argument that the government make be look what the military want to do here be something very sensible it keep tight what it need to keep tight but it allow to be more open area that can that it it do not have an interest in secure entirely and that be for the convenience of military personnel it be for the convenience of other people who live around the base what be wrong with that may i just ask a background question mr horwich what be the history of this first amendment area what when do this speech area come into be be the litigation essentially like this one basically say that this be not under military command ,201.52,Roberts Court,"Dec 4, 2013",United States,John D.

2013,"Medtronic, Inc. v. Boston Scientific Corp.",114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Waxman, as I understand it the agreement in this case identified certain patents and contemplated that there would be disputes about whether particular products of Medtronic violated or infringed or practiced, whatever, those patents. But there might be some other kinds of agreements which instead identify certain products-- --and essentially treat those as infringing products in the absence of a license. In that sort of agreement, would you make the same kind of claim, that if Medtronic had that agreement that identified certain products, but Medtronic woke up one day and said, you know what, we don't think that those products infringe, we essentially want to relitigate our agreement, can Medtronic come to court and do that via a declaratory judgment action, and if so who would bear the burden of proof? Well, they can be an infringer, Mr. Neustadt, if-- --They can be an infringer if they say we're ignoring our agreement; we're not paying royalties, but we're going to go on and continue making the product. Then MVF would say they would be infringing. And that's the world that MedImmune imagines is happening. No, I'm finished. Well, Mr. Neustadt, I think I just disagree with that. You keep on saying it's a question of claim coverage, but the question of claim coverage, all that is, is part of an infringement analysis. And that's the analysis, as Justice Kennedy said, that's the analysis that would have been appropriate if Medtronic had stopped paying royalties and MVF had sued Medtronic as a result for patent infringement. And that's the world that we're supposed to imagine after MedImmune, is if, contra the -- the actual agreement, the licensee stopped paying royalties and we think about an infringement suit. It's -- it's not a patent law exception. It's the recognition that a procedural device that simply changes the nominal status of the parties doesn't change the substantive rules, and that the burden of proof counts as a substantive issue. Mr. Neustadt, I was under the impression that, according to this contract, if Medtronics stops paying royalties you can bring not only a contract suit, but in fact a patent suit. An infringement suit. But you can bring an infringement suit according to the very agreement that you signed. They are infringing if they break the contract and they stop paying royalties. And then you can bring an infringement suit.

2013,"Argentina v. NML Capital, Ltd.",114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Kneedler, can I take you back to a question, I think it was Justice Alito who asked it. Assume that there was a suit between private parties and the private party that won the judgment thought that there were assets abroad. Do you have any question that the discovery rules would allow for discovery of what the person had abroad? But that's -- if you think that Rule 69 allows that, I mean, my next question was going to be what in the text would put a foreign government in a different position than the -- than when the suit involved only private parties? What in the text -- what in the text puts you in a different position -- if you have that view of 69, which extends abroad as well as within the United States, what in the text would suggest that we're not under that rule? Mr. Olson, can I just make sure I understand the scope of your argument? I mean, suppose there were some countries that executed on assets that in the United States would be nonexecutable. So suppose there were some countries that would execute on military assets or diplomatic assets or so forth. And somebody came into a U.S. court and said I want discovery about those assets, because after all, they are going to let me execute -- these other countries are going to let me execute on them. It's in aid of the judgment, so it fits within the discovery rules. What should the United States say to a -- a United States court say to a request like that, fine? If you win on the categorical question that's presented here, do you think it's still open to Argentina to go back to the district court and to say, modify your ruling for this or that privilege reason or because the order is overinclusive or any of these more prudential conversations.

2013,McCullen v. Coakley,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Rienzi, the State says, of that particular tool, that it's a hard thing to prosecute because you have to show intent, and there is a lot of obstruction and interference that goes on naturally just because there are a lot of people around. So that is an insufficient tool is what the State argues. And sometimes there are those bad actors, but probably more often it's just a function of there are just lots of people, and they, your clients and all of -- all of them want to be as close as possible to the site, and that that naturally leads to an interference with normal access. But are you saying that you could not do an act that instead just says, look, it's a little bit too hard to figure out what and what does not disrupt peace and order, so we're just going to say 25 feet around a funeral, or 25 feet around any facility, that that's never permissible? Well, for example, I was intrigued by one of the examples that you gave in your own brief, which you said slaughterhouses. So, let's say, that there are animal rights activists, and this is easy to imagine, who try to interfere with access in and out of slaughterhouses. And a State passes a regulation that says there's a ton of interference, it's preventing the operation of these facilities, employees can't get in, suppliers can't get in, slaughterhouses are leaving the State because of this problem, and so we're just going to set up a zone and let's call it 30 feet, because it's very hard to enforce anything else. I guess my reaction to that hypothetical -- you -- you must have used it for me to say, oh, that's terrible. But my reaction, my intuition was kind of what's wrong with that? Just have everybody take a step back. So what is wrong with that? But let's go back to the slaughterhouse case. I mean, there might be people who say it's really important to us to actually be able to face-to-face talk with the employees and tell them why they should get different jobs or why they should change their practices in various kinds of ways. And, you know, there are some people who think signs and chants are great, but there are people who really want to make one-to-one contact with the truck drivers, with the employees, whoever. But -- but you say, you know, we have to let whatever interference goes on, even if there's a record of -- of real obstruction, of real interference with the operation of the facility, in order to allow that to happen. And I guess I think that that's -- that's pretty hard. But isn't that more a function that they just have a private parking lot? So even if this law didn't exist, you actually couldn't reach most of these people because they drive into the private parking lot and you can't talk to them anyway. Is there a buffer zone that you would concede is permissible? In other words, if it were 12 feet, would that be all right? Well, but that goes back to Justice Ginsburg's question. I mean, how is a law supposed to deal with -- with that, sort of the fluctuating conditions that may be at a particular clinic site? It's more than a speech-free zone. It's also a conduct-free zone, right? You can't sell hats there, you can't, you know, beg there. I mean, you just can't go there. It's still a thoroughfare-- Well, it's more than a few feet. You know, 35 feet is a ways. It's from this bench to the end of the court. And if you imagine the Chief Justice as sort of where the door would be, it's most of the width of this courtroom as well. It's -- it's pretty much this courtroom, kind of. That's a lot of space. How did you pick 35 feet? Why 35? Well, that raises another question, Ms. Miller, because I assume that that's true because the crowds and the obstruction really are with respect to one facility at certain periods of time. So Mr. Rienzi says, look, if it's at one facility, not all ten of them or whatever it is, and it's only for certain periods of time, not all day every day, you know, why not narrow it that way? So why not? And I would think, Ms. Miller, that if you tried to do a statute that distinguished between protestors and counselors, that would be content-based much more than this statute is. I mean, but -- you know, which is not to say that this statute doesn't have its problems, in my view. I mean, so I guess I'm a little bit hung up on why you need so much space. Is that true, Mr. Rienzi? Is Massachusetts' statute the only one of this kind? ",mr rienzi the state say of that particular tool that it be a hard thing to prosecute because you have to show intent and there be a lot of obstruction and interference that go on naturally just because there be a lot of people around so that be an insufficient tool be what the state argues and sometimes there be those bad actor but probably more often it be just a function of there be just lot of people and they your client and all of all of them want to be as close as possible to the site and that that naturally lead to an interference with normal access but be you say that you could not do an act that instead just say look it be a little bit too hard to figure out what and what do not disrupt peace and order so we be just go to say foot around a funeral or foot around any facility that that be never permissible well for example i be intrigue by one of the example that you give in your own brief which you say slaughterhouse so let us say that there be animal right activist and this be easy to imagine who try to interfere with access in and out of slaughterhouse and a state pass a regulation that say there be a ton of interference it be prevent the operation of these facility employee can not get in supplier can not get in slaughterhouse be leave the state because of this problem and so we be just go to set up a zone and let us call it foot because it be very hard to enforce anything else i guess my reaction to that hypothetical you you must have use it for me to say oh that be terrible but my reaction my intuition be kind of what be wrong with that just have everybody take a step back so what be wrong with that but let us go back to the slaughterhouse case i mean there might be people who say it be really important to us to actually be able to face to face talk with the employee and tell them why they should get different job or why they should change their practice in various kind of way and you know there be some people who think sign and chant be great but there be people who really want to make one to one contact with the truck driver with the employee whoever but but you say you know we have to let whatever interference go on even if there be a record of of real obstruction of real interference with the operation of the facility in order to allow that to happen and i guess i think that that be that be pretty hard but be not that more a function that they just have a private parking lot so even if this law do not exist you actually could not reach most of these people because they drive into the private parking lot and you can not talk to them anyway be there a buffer zone that you would concede be permissible in other word if it we be foot would that be all right well but that go back to justice ginsburg s question i mean how be a law suppose to deal with with that sort of the fluctuating condition that may be at a particular clinic site it be more than a speech free zone it be also a conduct free zone right you can not sell hat there you can not you know beg there i mean you just can not go there it be still a thoroughfare well it be more than a few foot you know foot be a way it be from this bench to the end of the court and if you imagine the chief justice as sort of where the door would be it be most of the width of this courtroom as well it be it be pretty much this courtroom kind of that be a lot of space how do you pick foot why well that raise another question ms miller because i assume that that be true because the crowd and the obstruction really be with respect to one facility at certain period of time so mr rienzi say look if it be at one facility not all ten of them or whatever it be and it be only for certain period of time not all day every day you know why not narrow it that way so why not and i would think ms miller that if you try to do a statute that distinguish between protestors and counselor that would be content base much more than this statute be i mean but you know which be not to say that this statute do not have its problem in my view i mean so i guess I be a little bit hang up on why you need so much space be that true mr rienzi be massachusetts statute the only one of this kind ,266.77,Roberts Court,"Jan 15, 2014","Eleanor McCullen, Jean Zarrella, Gregory A.

That's obviously a concern of ours when we interpret a treaty, that all other countries interpret it in a -- in a single way. Do you contest that? Are there any other countries that apply equitable tolling rules? Ms. Moskowitz, going back to Justice Alito's question. Could you tell me how you think this works? You said, in response to Justice Alito, that sometimes concealment can be a factor in determining whether a child is settled. And I presume you mean if somebody conceals the child by moving the child from place to place, the child would not be settled. Is it also a factor in determining whether a settled child should nonetheless be returned? Or under Article 18. No, but prior to that. If you could go back to -- do you agree with Justice Scalia, that really, at that point, there's nothing to do? Once the determination has been made that the child is settled, there is no remaining discretion that the judge has? Well, if that's the case, if you're reading it that way -- I mean, I was reading it Justice Scalia's way, too. The first clause says shall and the second clause says shall not. But there is an alternate reading where the first clause says shall and the second clause essentially says ""may or may not at your discretion. "" But, boy, that would open up a big discretionary hole if you read it that way, wouldn't it? If I understand the way you think this works, you don't -- there's not even a presumption that a settled child will stay, right?

How could that possibly make sense? Well, could you say more about that? You said that the Chief Justice's question was right, that it doesn't work for the first person and you said there are better ones. What are the better ones? But, you know -- I mean, it struck me when I read your brief that it said, I don't know why these courts started where they started, whether each violation is worth 1,000 or 5,000 or 50,000. And it seems as though somebody just plucks an initial number out of the air and then everything is pegged to that initial number, but that the initial number has nothing in particular behind it or am I -- is it more sensible than that? But you are not claiming, are you -- or are you? that she's been victimized to the tune of 3.4 million as a result of this particular defendant's offense? Well, contributed to. But I take it that the point of the government's submission is only contributed to and now we have to sort of approximate what the contribution was. And you come in and you say, no, it shouldn't be -- notwithstanding that this particular offense was responsible for only a part, you think the defendant should be liable for the whole. I guess I'm just not sure what that means, contributed to $100. Does that mean she's -- the defendant is responsible for the entire $100-- --as a matter of fact, or does it mean that the defendant is responsible as a matter of fact for some lesser part of the entire harm? I -- I guess I'm -- when I say responsible I don't mean as a legal conclusion. I mean did the defendant cause the entire $100 of harm? Well, that's-- --Well, full amount-- --from the particular offense, Mr. Cassell, so that it's the full amount of whatever the particular offense caused. But you're not saying that this Defendant caused the entire 3.4. Usually when we approve joint and several liability we do so against a background of a functioning system of contribution where one defendant pays the entire thing, but then can go after-- --other defendants and be pretty well assured that he gets their share. Now, here, there's nothing like that and the question -- I guess the question is you're asking us to impose that kind of system without the usual thing that goes along with it, which is a sharing mechanism.

And you're saying that we should do something different. You're saying that we should expand what falsity means in this context as a sort of extra protection, and I guess why is that true? I guess I'm not sure what you just said, because even the way you just phrased that, you're asking what TSA would have done. How else can we think about materiality other than by asking, well, if you were a TSA officer and you heard this what would you have done? Mr. Russell, weren't you yourself suggesting the twist on the materiality standard? You said it shouldn't be -- in the usual case, we said would it have had a different effect on the mind of essentially the average reader, the reasonable reader. And you say: No, here we're not supposed to think of the reasonable person generally; we're supposed to think about the reasonable TSA officer. Haven't you conceded that yourself? Well, how do we know about the reasonable TSA officer? I mean, you made the point that we don't know a lot about TSA officers in terms of what they are going to do with respect to any given set of facts, and, you know, I find it a little bit hard to think about the question, what does a reasonable TSA officer think, without thinking about the question, what's a reasonable TSA officer going to do. So what are the other things TSA could have done? I mean, let's assume that this call was made and it was a much more -- in tone, it was much more factual and without using any of these words, but it said the guy really lost his temper and, you know, he has this license and we have no idea whether he, in fact, is carrying a gun, but he could be? What could the TSA officers have done? What do you think they should have done short of what they did? Say that they were concerned, they thought this might be a problem? What are the midlevel possibilities of a response? Well, Mr. Cohn, what if I think that a TSA might have reacted differently to what was actually said and to what really should have been said? Would they have reacted either way, they should have done something either way, but they would have done a different kind of thing? What if I think that?

2013,United States v. Woods,114,Elena Kagan,"Would it be a fair way to look at this to say that what you do at the partnership level is anything that doesn't require looking at an individual's tax return? Mr. Garre, it seems as though you and the Government agree on sort of the nature of this problem, right? Which is you have a partnership item, which is the sham determination. That leads to an adjustment in outside basis which, as you just said, is not a partnership item, is instead an affected item; and that leads to a penalty, right? So there's kind of three things, two steps in the process. And you say, well, that's not enough, essentially because the penalty has to directly relate to a partnership item. And they say it is enough because it's okay if it indirectly relates to the partnership item. And I guess the question is: In some sense you're both adding adjectives to the statute. You add directly, they add indirectly. How do we pick between those? And in that sense, Mr. Garre, it strikes me as wrong to say the words in dispute are “ partnership item ”. Actually, everybody agrees what ""partnership item: Means, what it includes, and what it doesn't include. "" ""It doesn't include outside basis. "" ""The government is perfectly happy to concede that. "" It seems as though the words in dispute are what does “ relate to ” mean and does “ relate to ” have to be “ relate to ” in this very direct way that excludes this intermediate step of adjusting outside basis. But I think that-- --Well, that was the prototypical case, Mr. Garre. There's no question that that's the central case that -- that Congress had in mind. But it doesn't have to be the only case. And they wrote words that seem to be applicable to this case as well as to the kind of case that you're talking about. I'm sorry. You're saying they have text, and you have a bunch of other things.

2013,"Northwest, Inc. v. Ginsberg",114,Elena Kagan,"I guess I don't understand that, Mr. Clement, because I always thought that the way these agreements worked were there were agreements that if I flew a certain number of miles on your plan, I was going to get a free ticket. And -- and it wasn't a gift that I was getting a free ticket, it was because I did something, I flew a certain number of miles. So that there was an exchange with value on both sides. I just don't see why that would make sense. Because if I knew that it was really up to you to give me the free ticket, maybe I was willing to get it and maybe I wasn't. I don't think that I'd be spending all this time in the air on your planes. You know, I'd find another company that actually gave me the free ticket. But usually what we say when a contract has no consideration, we don't say, oh, we're going to hold you to it anyway because the market will solve it. We say the contract has no consideration, it's illusory, in just the way that Justice Ginsburg pointed out. And the question is: If there's really no obligation on the part of the airline here to give that free ticket, if they can do it when they feel like it and not do it when they don't feel like it, why is there any consideration? Why isn't the contract not illusory? Well, Mr. Clement, suppose that this complaint only had one count. And suppose that they had said: Look, we have this contract and it gives very substantial discretion, it gives -- you know, by the words alone, it gives absolute discretion to Northwest, but that can't really be right because contracts have this implied covenant of good faith. There's an implied duty to perform in good faith. And that means that this discretion is narrowed in certain kinds of ways, that they can't terminate my membership for certain kinds of reasons. And that's all the complaint said. There was just this one count. Do you think that would be preempted? I guess what I'm suggesting is that the implied covenant here, it's just an interpretive tool. It says that there are certain kinds of provisions that are written very broadly or very vaguely, and an implied covenant comes in to help us interpret those kinds of provisions. And viewed in that way, it's just a contractual device that in light of Wolens ought to be permitted. But if it can't be waived, it sure seems as though it is operating independently of the parties' reasonable expectations. I mean, it might be, right, because people have different expectations in those two different situations, and that the at-will employment is so pervasive and so customary and so sweeping that the policy, the rule of an implied covenant of good faith doesn't apply there because we think everybody expects it not to apply there. That would be weird, isn't it, because in such a State, there might be a contract where the parties reasonably did expect this implicit term that limits something, a very broad conferral of discretion to operate. And yet, just because this State supreme court has framed its argument in a particular kind of way, they don't get the benefit of that.

2013,Octane Fitness v. ICON Health & Fitness,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Telscher, could I just ask very quickly the factors that you would think a Court should consider. One is the degree to which the case is meritless. Another I presume is bad faith. Another is litigation misconduct. Is there anything else or are those the three? But I think, Mr. Martinez, what the Chief Justice is driving at is there's a bit of a disconnect between your list of factors and those two words. Gross injustice, I mean that's -- that's really, really exceptional. That sounds like ""shocks the conscience"". That sounds like something you've never seen happen in the litigation system ever. But then you're saying essentially ratchet it down when you list all of these various factors. And maybe that's right, we shouldn't be obsessed with this word ""gross injustice"". It just seems a disconnect between the two words and all the factors. Mr. Phillips, I realize that you have this argument that this statute was before Rule 11, so the -- the super fluidity argument doesn't work.

2013,Robers v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"Ms. Harrington, your whole argument really rests on that statutory language. And one of the questions that came up in the last half hour is, is that the right section of the statute. Now, in your view, which is that the only thing involved here is money, that's all that's involved here, why aren't we under A rather than B? Right. But usually when you don't have money, I mean, say -- let's just say I'm a fraud victim, and I get an order of restitution for $100,000, and the fraudster doesn't have the $100,000. He only has $50,000. So the court says: Well, now you have to pay the $50,000 and we're going to put you on a schedule of payments, and you are going to pay the other 50 over the next year or 2 years, whatever. Would you think that that's under B? So you think that my hypothetical -- let me -- I'm just -- I'm sorry for -- is under B, not under A? So any time I don't have enough money to make the victim whole, it's under B, not A? Well, I don't -- I guess -- gosh, I don't know. But I would have just thought that it was under A for pretty much the same reason that Justice Breyer said. It just doesn't make sense for it to be under B. I mean, essentially you are saying, you know, if -- if -- if return of the cash is impossible, pay the cash under B. That -- that just doesn't -- that's not a sensible statutory command. No, but you see if the -- it would make a difference as to whether A or B applies because your whole argument is premised on the language of B. So if we're not in B, if we're in A, your statutory argument goes away, and then we just try to figure out what offset rules make sense. I mean, there's got to be an offset in A, too, right? Suppose we were under A. It's got to be. You don't think that there is an offset under A? Yes, but suppose -- suppose another case. Just say the second half to Justice Breyer. Sorry. Well, what do you think happens in an A case where let's -- let's -- in a mortgage case, so there's a home, but this -- this person also has cash and repays the full amount in cash. And now the bank has the full amount in cash, but also has this home. And then the bank sells the home. Is -- is the defendant entitled to an offset? I know. But if it did arise, because I'm trying to figure out -- it seems to me that there has to be an implicit offset in A as well. Well, how does the defendant get the benefit of that? What would the defendants do to go get the excess? Over the -- the total amount lost? But if I could just be clear about what you're saying, you're saying it's not the sale price when the sale is for a nominal amount; is that right? And it's not the sale price if the lender has done something commercially unreasonable? Is that right? And so if that's right and both of those things sound right, but why doesn't that kind of explode your statutory argument, because then it's not any part of the property that's returned. ",ms harrington your whole argument really rest on that statutory language and one of the question that come up in the last half hour be be that the right section of the statute now in your view which be that the only thing involve here be money that be all that be involve here why be not we under a rather than b right but usually when you do not have money i mean say let us just say I be a fraud victim and i get an order of restitution for and the fraudster do not have the he only have so the court say well now you have to pay the and we be go to put you on a schedule of payment and you be go to pay the other over the next year or year whatever would you think that that be under b so you think that my hypothetical let me I be just I be sorry for be under b not under a so any time i do not have enough money to make the victim whole it be under b not a well i do not i guess gosh i do not know but i would have just think that it be under a for pretty much the same reason that justice breyer say it just do not make sense for it to be under b i mean essentially you be say you know if if if return of the cash be impossible pay the cash under b that that just do not that be not a sensible statutory command no but you see if the it would make a difference as to whether a or b applies because your whole argument be premise on the language of b so if we be not in b if we be in a your statutory argument go away and then we just try to figure out what offset rule make sense i mean there be get to be an offset in a too right suppose we we be under a it be get to be you do not think that there be an offset under a yes but suppose suppose another case just say the second half to justice breyer sorry well what do you think happens in an a case where let us let us in a mortgage case so there be a home but this this person also have cash and repay the full amount in cash and now the bank have the full amount in cash but also have this home and then the bank sell the home be be the defendant entitle to an offset i know but if it do arise because I be try to figure out it seem to me that there have to be an implicit offset in a as well well how do the defendant get the benefit of that what would the defendant do to go get the excess over the the total amount lose but if i could just be clear about what you be say you be say it be not the sale price when the sale be for a nominal amount be that right and it be not the sale price if the lender have do something commercially unreasonable be that right and so if that be right and both of those thing sound right but why do not that kind of explode your statutory argument because then it be not any part of the property that be return ,171.03999999999994,Roberts Court,"Feb 25, 2014",Benjamin Robers,United States,12-9012,"Oct 21, 2013","May 5, 2014",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2013,Madigan v. Levin,114,Elena Kagan,"Could I go back, Mr. Scodro, to the -- to the rationale of -- of the -- that you're relying on. I mean, you keep on saying “ part and parcel ”. But how is it part and parcel? That seems to ally the distinction between a right and a remedy. There's one question whether there has been a violation of law. There's another question whether a cause of action exists to remedy that violation. Why aren't those two separate inquiries? Well, I guess I'm asking you to explain it to me-- --because that footnote is about a sentence long. So what's the theory as to why these are part and parcel of each other? Well, that seems a different argument, not that the two really are intertwined with each other, but it -- that it just might make sense to consider the one at the outset even though, in fact, it's a separate inquiry. For some -- please. But I think the point here is that Mr. Levin is covered not by the ADEA, but by a separate statute, the GERA. And there's a separate question whether the GERA would displace constitutional relief, which apparently has -- has never been argued to anybody in this case. Well, there are some many similarities, many similarities, between the ADEA and the GERA. But there are also real differences. I mean, they're obvious -- they obviously cover different people; there are different procedural prerequisites for the suit; you get a different kind of review, you only get administrative review under the GERA. So it's a separate inquiry as to whether this statute that has some commonalities, some differences, displaces constitutional claims, and it's an inquiry that really has never been addressed in this case. Do you also agree that he is covered by GERA? Well, it was never discussed because you never raised it; isn't that right? Mr. Theobald, are there any cases out there in the universe of cases in which a person does not have an ADEA claim or a GERA claim, but has pressed a successful constitutional claim based on age discrimination? I guess the question is, what are the circumstances in which, given the very low standard or given -- given the very low rational basis standard, what are the circumstances in which you would have a viable constitutional claim but not a statutory claim? What would that case look like? Well, not if there's no jurisdiction, right? If they didn't have jurisdiction, the thing would be wiped out. Mr. Scodro, you are in a situation where the question is not whether the remedial scheme displaces a 1983 suit brought for a violation of the same statute that contains the remedial scheme. Instead, you have to argue that this remedial scheme displaces a preexisting statutory or constitutional right. And when we've had that situation in the past, we've looked to more than just the remedial scheme itself. You know, Smith looks to the language of the statute, which refers to constitutional claims. It looks for legislative history. It looks to the coincidence between the statute -- the new statutory claim and the old constitutional claim. And it seems to me that you don't have any of those things. All you have is a complicated remedial scheme, which would be enough to say, look, you can't bring 1983 suits to vindicate this statute. But seems as though it's not enough under our case law to repeal preexisting rights and remedies. ",could i go back mr scodro to the to the rationale of of the that you be rely on i mean you keep on say part and parcel but how be it part and parcel that seem to ally the distinction between a right and a remedy there have one question whether there have be a violation of law there be another question whether a because of action exists to remedy that violation why be not those two separate inquiry well i guess I be ask you to explain it to me because that footnote be about a sentence long so what be the theory as to why these be part and parcel of each other well that seem a different argument not that the two really be intertwine with each other but it that it just might make sense to consider the one at the outset even though in fact it be a separate inquiry for some please but i think the point here be that mr levin be cover not by the adea but by a separate statute the gera and there have a separate question whether the gera would displace constitutional relief which apparently have have never be argue to anybody in this case well there be some many similarity many similarity between the adea and the gera but there be also real difference i mean they be obvious they obviously cover different people there be different procedural prerequisite for the suit you get a different kind of review you only get administrative review under the gera so it be a separate inquiry as to whether this statute that have some commonality some difference displaces constitutional claim and it have an inquiry that really have never be address in this case do you also agree that he be cover by gera well it be never discuss because you never raise it be not that right mr theobald be there any case out there in the universe of case in which a person do not have an adea claim or a gera claim but have press a successful constitutional claim base on age discrimination i guess the question be what be the circumstance in which give the very low standard or give give the very low rational basis standard what be the circumstance in which you would have a viable constitutional claim but not a statutory claim what would that case look like well not if there be no jurisdiction right if they do not have jurisdiction the thing would be wipe out mr scodro you be in a situation where the question be not whether the remedial scheme displace a suit bring for a violation of the same statute that contain the remedial scheme instead you have to argue that this remedial scheme displace a preexisting statutory or constitutional right and when we have have that situation in the past we have look to more than just the remedial scheme itself you know smith look to the language of the statute which refer to constitutional claim it look for legislative history it look to the coincidence between the statute the new statutory claim and the old constitutional claim and it seem to me that you do not have any of those thing all you have be a complicated remedial scheme which would be enough to say look you can not bring suit to vindicate this statute but seem as though it be not enough under our case law to repeal preexist right and remedy ,210.62000000000003,Roberts Court,"Oct 7, 2013",Lisa Madigan et al.,Harvey N.

2014,Kellogg Brown & Root v. U.S. ex rel. Carter,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Elwood, I take the point, and that seems like a fair understanding of why that term came out. But it wasn't the only change that they made at that point. And taking that term out may have had more than one reason, of course. So two other changes they make are, they put in the word ""any"". So the old statute just says ""offense"" and now it's ""any offense"", which suggests breadth and expansiveness. And the other thing, of course, is that they do all of this in connection with this Contract Settlement Act, which presumably refers both to civil and to criminal matters. And it follows right after this Contract Settlement Act and suggests that it's following on it. So, you know, put all those three things together: The taking out of the indictment language, the putting in the word ""any"", and the passage in conjunction with the Contract Settlement Act. I think that that would be an argument on the other side. Contract settlement. Contract settlement. Mr. Stone, don't take this for more than it's worth because I think there are plenty of arguments against you, but I'm actually not sure I understand this one. I mean, it seems to me if your view is it applies to both criminal and civil offenses-- --well, Congress had to put the thing someplace. It could have put it in the criminal code or it could have put it with all the other civil-- --Either way, there'd be kind of a mismatch.

2014,Tibble v. Edison International,114,Elena Kagan,"And if I could just ask again, Mr. Frederick, what that duty includes in addition to the changed circumstances situation. In other words, just on a continuing basis -- and tell me in a way that includes this case but isn't limited to this case -- on a continuing basis what is a trustee supposed to do under the prudent person's standard? I would think, Mr. Frederick -- tell me if you disagree with this. I would think that it's possible that a decision to buy one of these funds with high expenses would be imprudent in the first place, and yet, it might be prudent not to switch midstream. In other words, there are costs to switching midstream. You have to tell everybody about it. I'm not sure what the costs are. But is -- is it possible that a decision that was imprudent in the first place, to -- to buy, that it, nonetheless, could be true that a hold decision is prudent? So if I could just understand that, essentially, you want us to say, look, there is this prudent person standard. It applies throughout to monitor and as well as to the original purchase, but then we're not really going to tell you what that prudent person standard is, that we will instead let the lower courts deal with that in -- in considering this case. Is that what you want? But when Mr. Frederick said before, he said something like anything -- any periodic review, you're going to look at the returns, you're going to look at the expenses, and you're going to look to see whether there's a change in the -- in the, you know, basic nature of the company or something. You agree with all of that; is that right? Mr. Hacker, I don't know what that means. It seems to me when I read your brief, that your brief is supporting the -- the Ninth Circuit's position, which is that it's only when significant changes occurs. No, I don't think -- Well, Mr. Hacker, here's what you say -- here's what you say in your brief. What you say in your brief is, ""After the initial selection, the fiduciary may conduct much less intensive periodic reviews monitoring only"" -- ""monitoring only for significant changes in the value and risks of the investments."" That presents a very different view. As I see the difference, you say you're monitoring only for significant changes in the value and risks of the investment, and they're saying, look, you have this periodic duty. One of the things you're looking for is significant changes; but you also, on an ongoing basis, just like ordinary people do with their own investment portfolio, you look at the return, you look at the expense. In something like this, it's not like we're scouring the whole universe for cheaper funds. It's like we realize, oh, look, it's the exact same fund with cheaper expenses. In something like this, you make the change. Now, really, are you saying -- what kind of disruption could be worth, on an ongoing basis, for people who have invested in funds for 30 and 40 years and where there's a significant difference in fees, what kind of disruption could be worth the price of that? Well, why don't you answer that one? (Laughter.) Mr. Hacker, here is what you argued to the Ninth Circuit -- what you argued to the Ninth Circuit. ERISA's 6-year limitations period bars challenges to funds added to the plan more than 6 years before this action was filed. Then you got exactly what you wanted from the Ninth Circuit with the single exception that the Ninth circuit added a fact, that by the way, that doesn't apply to changed circumstances. Then you described to this Court what you got from the Ninth Circuit, in the terms that Justice Breyer said, which was exactly that the only kind of monitoring claim available to a plaintiff is when there are changed circumstances. And then you file a brief in which you sometimes say that the Ninth Circuit is completely right and then you sometimes purport to be agreeing that the Ninth Circuit was wrong. Now, to me, that's raising a lot of dust for something that is pretty clearly what the Ninth Circuit said, what you asked for, and what is wrong? That was -- that was -- -- page 22. It's in your summary of the argument. A fiduciary may conduct much less intensive periodic reviews, monitoring only for significant changes. No, I don't think he said that. I asked a very particular question relating to this particular fund, saying what kind of disruption -- is there any kind of disruption that would be worth the price of holding onto a fund that is the exact same as another fund except that it has much higher fees. And he said, as to that particular case, no, there wouldn't be. How might a lessor of -- They don't like changes. They would rather have fees? Mr. Hacker -- MR. HACKER -- fee. -- the day when you get from your mutual funds a notice that says, by the way, you're a preferred investor, we're switching you, it's the exact same fund under a different name, now you don't pay fees -- that's a red-letter day for an investor. ",and if i could just ask again mr frederick what that duty include in addition to the change circumstance situation in other word just on a continue basis and tell me in a way that include this case but be not limit to this case on a continue basis what be a trustee suppose to do under the prudent person s standard i would think mr frederick tell me if you disagree with this i would think that it be possible that a decision to buy one of these fund with high expense would be imprudent in the first place and yet it might be prudent not to switch midstream in other word there be cost to switch midstream you have to tell everybody about it I be not sure what the cost be but be be it possible that a decision that be imprudent in the first place to to buy that it nonetheless could be true that a hold decision be prudent so if i could just understand that essentially you want us to say look there be this prudent person standard it apply throughout to monitor and as well as to the original purchase but then we be not really go to tell you what that prudent person standard be that we will instead let the low court deal with that in in consider this case be that what you want but when mr frederick say before he say something like anything any periodic review you be go to look at the return you be go to look at the expense and you be go to look to see whether there be a change in the in the you know basic nature of the company or something you agree with all of that be that right mr hacker i do not know what that mean it seem to me when i read your brief that your brief be support the the ninth circuit s position which be that it be only when significant change occurs no i do not think well mr hacker here s what you say here s what you say in your brief what you say in your brief be after the initial selection the fiduciary may conduct much less intensive periodic review monitor only monitor only for significant change in the value and risk of the investment that present a very different view as i see the difference you say you be monitor only for significant change in the value and risk of the investment and they be say look you have this periodic duty one of the thing you be look for be significant change but you also on an ongoing basis just like ordinary people do with their own investment portfolio you look at the return you look at the expense in something like this it be not like we be scour the whole universe for cheap fund it be like we realize oh look it be the exact same fund with cheap expense in something like this you make the change now really be you say what kind of disruption could be worth on an ongoing basis for people who have invest in fund for and year and where there be a significant difference in fee what kind of disruption could be worth the price of that well why do not you answer that one laughter mr hacker here be what you argue to the ninth circuit what you argue to the ninth circuit erisa s year limitation period bar challenge to fund add to the plan more than year before this action be file then you get exactly what you want from the ninth circuit with the single exception that the ninth circuit add a fact that by the way that do not apply to change circumstance then you describe to this court what you get from the ninth circuit in the term that justice breyer say which be exactly that the only kind of monitoring claim available to a plaintiff be when there be change circumstance and then you file a brief in which you sometimes say that the ninth circuit be completely right and then you sometimes purport to be agree that the ninth circuit be wrong now to me that be raise a lot of dust for something that be pretty clearly what the ninth circuit say what you ask for and what be wrong that be that be page it be in your summary of the argument a fiduciary may conduct much less intensive periodic review monitor only for significant change no i do not think he say that i ask a very particular question relate to this particular fund say what kind of disruption be there any kind of disruption that would be worth the price of hold onto a fund that be the exact same as another fund except that it have much high fee and he say as to that particular case no there would not be how might a lessor of they do not like change they would rather have fee mr hacker mr hacker fee the day when you get from your mutual fund a notice that say by the way you be a preferred investor we be switch you it be the exact same fund under a different name now you do not pay fee that be a red letter day for an investor ,291.95,Roberts Court,"Feb 24, 2015","Glenn Tibble, et al.","Edison International, et al.",13-550,"Oct 2, 2014","May 18, 2015",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2014,Dart Cherokee Basin Operating Company LLC v. Owens,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, that seems a little extreme to say it may never be corrected. I mean, this was a decision that was made by eight judges. There are now twelve judges. Maybe the additional four will make a difference. Maybe even those eight will think twice about it the next time around. I mean, in fact we just don't know, right, because we don't know why they acted the way they acted. It might have been because they thought that the district court's decision was right, or it might have been because they thought it -- that -- that question is better -- was better decided in some other context, or it might be because they were just feeling too busy that day. And -- and an abuse of discretion standard would go, you know, to the -- just the decision whether to take it, not knowing what that decision was based on. Mr. Berreth, I -- I apologize for going back to this not merits question, but on the question of why the Tenth Circuit did what it did, Judge Hartz, who was, of course, dissenting from denial, made reference to the fact -- and I'm just quoting here -- that the judges were very busy, and the appeal presented a knotty matter that requires a decision in short order. So even he, who was trying to suggest that an appeal should have been taken, was not suggesting that the court did what it did because the court agreed with the trial court. Mr. Berreth, that assumes that when an appeals court decides whether to take an appeal, all they are doing is making a merits determination. And if that's all that appeals courts were doing when they decide whether to take an appeal, then you would be right. But, in fact, we know from everything we do every day that when a court decides to take something or not to take something, they are not just making a merits evaluation. They are doing a thousand other things as well about how they think it's best to arrange their docket. And what we don't know is whether the Tenth Circuit here did one of those things. But this statute gives the appellate courts tremendous discretion on this area. It says it may take an appeal, it may not take an appeal. Think of the thousand things that you want to think about, not anything invidious, not anything permissible, but, you know, whether to take an appeal. And that's the only thing we know about it. Here's a question for you, because I sympathize with you. Because the next half-hour is going to reveal that, actually, most of us agree with you on the merits. Right? All right. I will limit it, I agree with you on the merits. All right? But I just don't see how to get around this. Here's my suggestion. Would it be sufficient for your purposes, you're worried about the sort of continuing effect of this, to just sort of get rid of this case, dismiss this case, but to -- we often explain why we dismiss cases and to suggest that we are dismissing it because we don't know whether the Tenth Circuit made a decision on the merits. And if and to the extent that the Tenth Circuit wants in the next case to make a decision on the merits, and if and to the extent that the Tenth Circuit wants in the next case to make a decision on the merits when it denies an appeal, it should say so, so as not to insulate that decision from review. That seems like a fair thing to say to the Tenth Circuit. Don't insulate your merits decisions from review. But it also seems to be, you know, to reflect what is true about this case, which is that we don't know whether it made a merits decision. No. I was not suggesting that we opine on the merits of the case. I would think that that would be not appropriate. No. That is not my suggestion, it might be your suggestion. But I don't see where you get that. You know, you say (c)(2), which is the preponderance standard, but that's just a standard that the court is going to use to make the determination about whether to be in Federal court or not. But it seems to me that the statute is best read -- is really only read to comport as Justice Ginsburg said, with the rest of the Federal rules. It's notice pleading, then the original plaintiff has a choice. The original plaintiff can contest the -- the removal and present evidence and in that case, the defendant comes back with evidence and the defendant bears the burden of proof and the court makes its decision on the basis of that two sets of evidence. But why one should think of the original notice as needing to contain evidence is just -- I guess I don't understand where that comes from. I'm sorry. I just -- you said if it doesn't come in at the time of removal, it comes in at the time of remand. But there's an alternate position, which is the notice of removal is just the allegation, if the plaintiff wants to contest that, the plaintiff can contest that, and then the defendant has to come forward with something because the defendant has the burden of proof. Likewise, if the court thinks that the allegation is not appropriate, the court can sua sponte say, you know, you have to show me more because I'm not sure I have jurisdiction over this. But either way, it all happens in the Federal court after the notice of removal, which is merely an allegation, is filed. And that makes perfect sense. It means that most allegations will just be accepted as is and the only ones that everybody will have to come forward with evidence are when there's some reason to contest it, when either the plaintiff or the court has some serious doubt about it.

2014,Holt v. Hobbs,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Laycock, you're relying on this case really on -- on felt intuitions that this couldn't possibly advance the State's interest. But for the most part in these cases, there will be some incremental gain with respect to the interests that this State has. So whether it's a full beard or whether it's long hair or whether it's a turban, there will be some ability to say, even though it's just teeny tiny, there is some increase in prison security that results from disallowing this practice. And I guess I want to know, and this really fits in with several of the other questions that have been asked here, is how do we think about that question in the context of this statute? Teeny tiny isn't enough. But how about, you know, measurable, although small? Or, you know, at what point does it become something that we say, yes, we have to take that into account? Well, suppose a State just simply says this: You know, actually, there's nothing special about our prison. We can't show you some special circumstance, but what we can show you is that prisons are in the business of making tradeoffs between security and other values, they do that every single day, and our State just thinks that the tradeoff should be more security oriented, so we insist on a greater level of security than our peer institutions do. And -- and are you saying that the statute prevents a State from doing that? But I do share Justice Alito's confusion on this point, because all the things that you're talking about are things that we would never allow in the typical strict scrutiny context. You know, all this kind of well, as long as they say something, they don't really have to prove it and it just has to sound kind of reasonable. And that's the very opposite of strict scrutiny generally. Do you think it's the same standard in both of those statutes? The language is completely the same. But I thought we actually used that in the recent RFRA case to suggest something about RFRA as well. Is that right? Can I ask a similar question? But, you know, lots of religions, including lots of religions of one, have dietary codes of various kinds. So suppose a lot of prisoners say, here's my dietary code personal to me, and all of that costs money, and let's just stipulate that as prisoner -- prisons have to spend money on that, they have less money to spend on things relating to internal security. How is somebody supposed to think about those kinds of questions, where it's just every time somebody makes a religious claim, the costs to the institution goes up and the ability of the institution to deal with security issues goes down? But I'm suggesting the costs are going -- you know, they come out of someplace. So how do we do that? So how do we do that? Mr. Laycock characterizes your position as being essentially all deference all the time. So I'll give you an opportunity to say when would deference be inappropriate? You made a statement just then, Mr. Laycock, about how to think about deference in the context of this statute and it's something that still troubles me, so I'm going to ask you to expand on that. To say -- it just seems like a contradiction in terms, so I want to understand how it's not a contradiction in terms. ",mr laycock you be rely on this case really on on felt intuition that this could not possibly advance the state s interest but for the most part in these case there will be some incremental gain with respect to the interest that this state have so whether it be a full beard or whether it be long hair or whether it be a turban there will be some ability to say even though it be just teeny tiny there be some increase in prison security that result from disallow this practice and i guess i want to know and this really fit in with several of the other question that have be ask here be how do we think about that question in the context of this statute teeny tiny be not enough but how about you know measurable although small or you know at what point do it become something that we say yes we have to take that into account well suppose a state just simply say this you know actually there be nothing special about our prison we can not show you some special circumstance but what we can show you be that prison be in the business of make tradeoff between security and other value they do that every single day and our state just think that the tradeoff should be more security orient so we insist on a great level of security than our peer institution do and and be you say that the statute prevent a state from do that but i do share justice alito s confusion on this point because all the thing that you be talk about be thing that we would never allow in the typical strict scrutiny context you know all this kind of well as long as they say something they do not really have to prove it and it just have to sound kind of reasonable and that be the very opposite of strict scrutiny generally do you think it be the same standard in both of those statute the language be completely the same but i think we actually use that in the recent rfra case to suggest something about rfra as well be that right can i ask a similar question but you know lot of religion include lot of religion of one have dietary code of various kind so suppose a lot of prisoner say here s my dietary code personal to me and all of that cost money and let us just stipulate that as prisoner prison have to spend money on that they have less money to spend on thing relate to internal security how be somebody suppose to think about those kind of question where it be just every time somebody make a religious claim the cost to the institution go up and the ability of the institution to deal with security issue go down but I be suggest the cost be go you know they come out of someplace so how do we do that so how do we do that mr laycock characterize your position as be essentially all deference all the time so I will give you an opportunity to say when would deference be inappropriate you make a statement just then mr laycock about how to think about deference in the context of this statute and it be something that still trouble me so I be go to ask you to expand on that to say it just seem like a contradiction in term so i want to understand how it be not a contradiction in term ,198.31,Roberts Court,"Oct 7, 2014",Gregory Houston Holt,"Ray Hobbs, Director, Arkansas Department of Corrections, et al.",13-6827,"Mar 3, 2014","Jan 20, 2015",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2014,Coleman v. Tollefson,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Lindstrom, I -- I understand that argument, and it seems to me a very natural reading of the statute. But the -- I'm troubled by the scenario where it's dismissed and then it's reversed, not for these practical reasons people that have been talking about. But it seems to me that if you were really reading the statute that way, that that would count as a strike, too, and that that strike would not go away even when it was reversed. And so I'm wondering whether the statute is actually a little bit more ambiguous than -- than you are suggesting, because at the very least, I mean, everybody agrees that you have to make an exception for that case, and it seems to me that on your reading of the statute, that case would be included. A strike would be a strike even if it's reversed. Yes, but that's something -- you're now appealing to some default principle that exists outside of the statutory text. I can't find any basis in the statutory text for that result. I mean, it's -- there have been three or more prior occasions in which either an action or an appeal has been dismissed. Now, one of those dismissals was later reversed, but it was dismissed. And so on your reading, we -- we really, you know, it's -- it's -- your reading is kind of -- this is the natural reading, but we're not going to -- we're not going to apply the natural reading in a case where it obviously doesn't fit. You know, and this is what I'm not quite sure about in your answer to my question, Mr. Lindstrom, is, if I understand you right, and tell me if I don't, you're basically saying that we look to these background principles and we decide that a strike doesn't happen if something is reversed on appeal, so a strike is kind of dependent on what happens on appeal. But when you say that, aren't you kind of giving up your best argument? I mean, aren't you then admitting that the notion of a strike encompasses what happens on appeal and encompasses finality on appeal? And just to be clear, Mr. Kedem, if we say, you know, we're not buying this prior occasion thing, does your -- does the rest of your position stay your position? ",mr lindstrom i i understand that argument and it seem to me a very natural reading of the statute but the I be trouble by the scenario where it be dismiss and then it be reverse not for these practical reason people that have be talk about but it seem to me that if you we be really read the statute that way that that would count as a strike too and that that strike would not go away even when it be reverse and so I be wonder whether the statute be actually a little bit more ambiguous than than you be suggest because at the very least i mean everybody agree that you have to make an exception for that case and it seem to me that on your reading of the statute that case would be include a strike would be a strike even if it be reverse yes but that be something you be now appeal to some default principle that exist outside of the statutory text i can not find any basis in the statutory text for that result i mean it be there have be three or more prior occasion in which either an action or an appeal have be dismiss now one of those dismissal be later reverse but it be dismiss and so on your reading we we really you know it be it be your reading be kind of this be the natural reading but we be not go to we be not go to apply the natural reading in a case where it obviously do not fit you know and this be what I be not quite sure about in your answer to my question mr lindstrom be if i understand you right and tell me if i do not you be basically say that we look to these background principle and we decide that a strike do not happen if something be reverse on appeal so a strike be kind of dependent on what happen on appeal but when you say that be not you kind of give up your best argument i mean be not you then admit that the notion of a strike encompass what happen on appeal and encompass finality on appeal and just to be clear mr kedem if we say you know we be not buy this prior occasion thing do your do the rest of your position stay your position ,128.41,Roberts Court,"Feb 23, 2015",Andre Lee Coleman,"Todd Tollefson, et al.",13-1333,"Oct 2, 2014","May 18, 2015",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2014,Ohio v. Clark,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Meyer, can I go back -- Sorry. Can I -- can I go back to what you said before in answer to Justice Scalia? We can all obviously agree that three year olds don't form any kind of intent to make testimonial statements. But -- but that would suggest that there -- the Confrontation Clause just doesn't come into play at all with respect to any people with diminished capacity, without the capacity to form that kind of legal intent. And that seems -- that seems not right to me. That it seems as though there ought to be some other inquiry that substitutes for the intent inquiry when we're talking about people with diminished capacity in order to decide whether a statement that they make is testimonial. Suppose this, Mr. Meyer. Let's take the -- the diminished capacity out of the equation. Let's just presume a 13-year-old kid rather than a 3-year-old. And the 13-year-old kid comes in with welts or bruises or whatever it is, and the teacher says to the 13-year-old, Listen, Joe, I want to know what happened, but I want to tell you that I'm under a statutory reporting obligation, so everything you tell me, I'm going to tell the police, and I'm going to write down everything you tell me just so I can get the facts straight. Would you think that that is testimonial such that it's a violation of the Confrontation Clause if that comes into a case without the opportunity for cross-exam? Well, that seems to me then, is then -- it suggests that the way to do this is actually more the way the S.G. suggests, that we should just ask in every case whether there -- whether a statement is testimonial rather than to draw the very sharp distinctions you want us to with respect to private parties. But what happens, Ms. Eisenstein, really along the lines of the hypothetical that I gave to Mr. Meyer where it's pretty clear to both the teacher and the student that back of that conversation, is the presence of police. In other words, the teacher will say, I'm under a reporting obligation, or maybe the kid will bring it up. If I tell you, does that mean it's going to the police? And the teacher says, Yes, it does. You know, what happens when -- when that arises? Well, would I be right to think that where there is any kind of serious injury, police are involved as a routine matter? Mr. -- Mr. Fisher, can I ask a question that steps back a little bit? Because it seems to me that the strongest part of your case goes something like this. This is a statement that's going to come in and is going to have great consequence in a trial. It's going to function as the most relevant kind of testimony imaginable, it's an accusation. In a case like this, there are two potential parties that could be accused. Essentially, this is fingering one of them, and it's being done by a three year old. And -- and the question of whether that's a particularly reliable way to choose between which of these two potential people did it is like a little bit scary. And then you're not being able to question it, you're not being able to do the things that you normally do. Okay. So all of that, seems to me, that's your strongest case. And it seems to me that it doesn't fit very well with the test we have and what the questions that we're supposed to ask. In other words, all of what I said seems to be -- or most of what I said at least -- seems to me kind of irrelevant to the question that we ask under the primary purpose test and what do we do with that lack of fit? You see, I think I don't think it really does. I mean, the way I've always understood the primary purpose test is that it's not whether it functions at trial as testimony or how the jury understands it; it really is how the declarant understands it, maybe leavened by some -- you know, what does the questioner think and what are the circumstances. But it seems to be mostly about the purpose of the person who's making the statement which -- which fits, you know, not very well with these kinds of concerns that you're talking about. ",mr meyer can i go back sorry can i can i go back to what you say before in answer to justice scalia we can all obviously agree that three year old do not form any kind of intent to make testimonial statement but but that would suggest that there the confrontation clause just do not come into play at all with respect to any people with diminished capacity without the capacity to form that kind of legal intent and that seem that seem not right to me that it seem as though there ought to be some other inquiry that substitute for the intent inquiry when we be talk about people with diminished capacity in order to decide whether a statement that they make be testimonial suppose this mr meyer let us take the the diminished capacity out of the equation let us just presume a year old kid rather than a year old and the year old kid come in with welt or bruise or whatever it be and the teacher say to the year old listen joe i want to know what happen but i want to tell you that I be under a statutory reporting obligation so everything you tell me I be go to tell the police and I be go to write down everything you tell me just so i can get the fact straight would you think that that be testimonial such that it be a violation of the confrontation clause if that come into a case without the opportunity for cross exam well that seem to me then be then it suggest that the way to do this be actually more the way the sg suggest that we should just ask in every case whether there whether a statement be testimonial rather than to draw the very sharp distinction you want us to with respect to private party but what happen ms eisenstein really along the line of the hypothetical that i give to mr meyer where it be pretty clear to both the teacher and the student that back of that conversation be the presence of police in other word the teacher will say I be under a reporting obligation or maybe the kid will bring it up if i tell you do that mean it be go to the police and the teacher say yes it do you know what happen when when that arise well would i be right to think that where there be any kind of serious injury police be involve as a routine matter mr mr fisher can i ask a question that step back a little bit because it seem to me that the strong part of your case go something like this this be a statement that be go to come in and be go to have great consequence in a trial it be go to function as the most relevant kind of testimony imaginable it be an accusation in a case like this there be two potential party that could be accuse essentially this be finger one of them and it be be do by a three year old and and the question of whether that be a particularly reliable way to choose between which of these two potential people do it be like a little bit scary and then you be not be able to question it you be not be able to do the thing that you normally do okay so all of that seem to me that be your strong case and it seem to me that it do not fit very well with the test we have and what the question that we be suppose to ask in other word all of what i say seem to be or most of what i say at least seem to me kind of irrelevant to the question that we ask under the primary purpose test and what do we do with that lack of fit you see i think i do not think it really do i mean the way I have always understand the primary purpose test be that it be not whether it function at trial as testimony or how the jury understand it it really be how the declarant understand it maybe leaven by some you know what do the questioner think and what be the circumstance but it seem to be mostly about the purpose of the person who be make the statement which which fit you know not very well with these kind of concern that you be talk about ,243.6,Roberts Court,"Mar 2, 2015",State of Ohio,Darius Clark,13-1352,"Oct 2, 2014","Jun 18, 2015",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2014,Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama,114,Elena Kagan,"And, Mr. Schnapper, isn't it right that after trial, when you submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, in fact, you did reference particular districts? You referenced Senate Districts 18, 19 and 20. In another place, you talked about all the majority-black districts in the State's black belt, and you explained how your theory of the case related to each one of those districts. I don't understand why that's so, General. I mean, what the plaintiffs are saying is yes, we have common evidence, not all together usual in a Shaw claim, but here they have evidence. It's a policy statement that retrogression was going to be a very main priority. I think it was number 2. And retrogression was defined in a certain way, as requiring the maintenance of black voting population. And that was going to be taken into account in every single majority minority district. Now, the fact that there's evidence, the principal evidence in the case, that relates to every single district and so in a sense the evidence is statewide, does not make it any less a district by district case. Well, I guess I would appreciate specific examples, because it seems to me as sort of a going-in matter that when you say this is the most important thing except for the Reynolds inquiry, this is the most important thing, that necessarily it's going to affect the way you redraw or who you put into the districts. You might not reach the target in every single district, but necessarily you're saying we are prioritizing this race-based this race-based thing, criterion, in a way that's going to affect every judgment we make. Well, how can it not be? If you have three priorities or three criteria and you say this is the absolute most important criteria, it's just the natural effect of that is going to be to minimize the other two criteria. But you don't deny that a statewide policy can refer to every district or every majority minority district in the State? But again and I don't want to press it if you've given me your best answer to it -- if a policy says we're going to prioritize this particular criteria, which here was the mistaken understanding of retrogression, if a policy says, we're going to prioritize this over everything else, it seems to me that that's pretty good evidence of a violation. But if the policy says that it's going to prioritize it over everything else, that means it going to be in derogation of tradition districting criteria. Sometimes they might fail. Sometimes you're not going to be able to prioritize it over everything else, but the intent is still to prioritize it over everything else. Are you really saying that that's a pleading requirement, that they have to come in with a plan that meets all the rest of your criteria? Mr. Brasher, I mean, let me just give you some numbers here from from some of these districts. Right? HD 52, you needed to add 1145 African Americans in order to maintain the percentage of African-American voters, which was your number 2 criterion. You added 1143. You missed by 2. HD 55, you needed to add 6981. You added 6994. SD 23, 15,069. You hit at 15,185. I mean, those numbers speak for themselves, don't they? That in each of these cases, you were determined, come what may and disregarding other criteria, to maintain the black voting age population. That was just a coincidence? Well, it's 73 percent, and you hit that 73 percent exactly. Well, I think you kind of do actually, because, I mean, you're trying to repopulate these districts, and many of these districts, yes, there are many, many, many African Americans. But as you just suggested, there are also white people. And you did it so that you, you know, completely replicated the exact percentage figure. Mr. -- Mr. Brasher, I mean, usually in these cases you're looking at these funny-shaped districts and you're trying to figure out from the shape and from other matters whether race has been used instead of traditional districting criteria. But this is a very sort -- you know, sort of sui generis Shaw claim, because here the principal evidence in the case is not all the circumstantial stuff that we usually do. It's a policy statement from the State that says race non-retrogression is going to be our principal criterion except for Reynolds, and then a clear testimony from the people who were applying that policy statement that they thought that that meant maintaining the black voting age population, something which is a mistaken understanding of what retrogression entails. But, you know, you don't have to look at all the circumstantial evidence about the shape of districts when you have a policy statement from the State saying this is our number one criterion except for Reynolds and this is how we understand it in such a way that it's going to ensure that a 68 percent district stays a 68 percent district and a 52 percent district stays a 52 percent district and so on. But this is much more than that. This is very specific saying where the -- the -- the two legislators principally in charge of this said this is what we understand the requirements are, that we're going to maintain the black voting age population in each district. Mr. Brasher, I guess I don't understand your response to Justice Ginsburg. I mean, there are different interpretations of what those 2006 amendments mean, right? Under one interpretation, it was basically a codification of Justice Souter's opinion, and so majority minority districts could be transformed into influence districts. On another stricter interpretation, perhaps, no majority minority districts had to stay majority minority districts. But in no interpretation does a 76 percent district have to stay a 76 percent district when circumstances change and when the ability to elect candidates of one's choice does not require it. But you don't have to use race in this way, Mr. Brasher. Nobody would say that Section 5 required you to maintain a 78 percent district and a 78 percent district was no longer needed with respect to a group's ability to elect a candidate of choice. Mr. Brasher, you're suggesting that there's some necessity for a 2 percent plan, but there is no necessity for a 2 percent plan. States have routinely gone up to 10 percent without getting into trouble under Reynolds. So that can't insulate your plan from this kind of challenge, can it? ",and mr schnapper be not it right that after trial when you submit propose finding of fact and conclusion of law in fact you do reference particular district you reference senate district and in another place you talk about all the majority black district in the state s black belt and you explain how your theory of the case relate to each one of those district i do not understand why that be

2014,"T-Mobile South, LLC v. City of Roswell, Georgia",114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Fisher, you're deriving all this from the word “ decision ” and “ decision ” as even the dictionary you principally cite, Blacks Law Dictionary states, “ decision ”, you know, can mean one of two things. It can mean an opinion or it can mean a judgment, and people refer to -- it use that word to refer to either. So why should we interpret it your way? Well, that only suggests that you need reasons. It doesn't suggest that the reasons have to appear in a decision as opposed to some other document. Well, doesn't that-- --All of these kinds of examples, don't they only suggest that a State or a locality would be well advised to write up a little paragraph that clearly states its reasons? But, you know, if they want to take the risk that a district court is going to say, gosh, I just can't find the reasons in this record, it's all too muddled. If they want to take that risk, what in the statute prevents it? No. But I mean, substantial evidence review requires reasons. If they want to take the risk that their that their minutes or their transcript will not allow the district court to do substantial evidence review, then, you know, they'll lose. As I understand the SG's position, the SG says there were five members of the council, three of them talked about the incompatibility of this tower with the neighborhood. So what in that statement do you contest? Do you think that three of them did not base this on the incompatibility of the fake tree with the neighborhood? The Solicitor General only needs one. Well, then you're going to reach the question that Justice Scalia had a view of, which was, you know, if two people think X and two people think Y and one person thinks Z, is that sufficient? But as long as you have something that three people think, why isn't that sufficient? Ms. O'Connell, I think part of Mr. Fisher's arguments is that if everyone agrees that reasons have to be given, what sense does it make to require judges to scour the minutes and to scour the transcript and to try to make these judgment calls about, you know, when an individual council member has given a reason? Why not at that point, once we're in the mode of requiring things, why not just require that the reasons be stated in the two or three sentences that the council or other body promulgates? Mr. Carothers, I wonder whether what Justice Alito pointed out about the nature of local governments, which you agreed with, whether that doesn't suggest that we should try to keep our rule quite simple. In other words, given that nobody in small local governments has access to great lawyers or knows a lot about communication, that we should just set up a rule that enables them to comply simply. And that rule, honestly, would be Mr. Fisher's rule. It would just say, in your decision, write a sentence or two saying why. Because otherwise, if we don't have that rule and every judge has to look through the minutes and the transcript and anything else in the record to decide whether a reason is clear enough, there are going to be a lot of local governments that are going to get kind of caught, and the judge is going to say, I'm sorry, it's not clear enough, even though if the government had spent just five minutes, it could have made it clear enough. And maybe we should just say, do that so that you don't get caught. Mr. Fisher, suppose that I think that you're right about that, but then the question is did Congress require that. And I take it that the SG is really saying, no, Congress required reasons, it required that by saying that there was substantial evidence review, but that it didn't require the reasons to be in any particular form, and, indeed, there's a savings clause which says that all doubts go to the State and local governments in this area. So notwithstanding that this is going to actually get State and local governments into some trouble, and notwithstanding that district courts are going to struggle with it, we should go with the SG's rule rather than with yours. ",mr fisher you be derive all this from the word decision and decision as even the dictionary you principally cite black law dictionary state decision you know can mean one of two thing it can mean an opinion or it can mean a judgment and people refer to it use that word to refer to either so why should we interpret it your way well that only suggest that you need reason it do not suggest that the reason have to appear in a decision as oppose to some other document well do not that all of these kind of example do not they only suggest that a state or a locality would be well advise to write up a little paragraph that clearly state its reason but you know if they want to take the risk that a district court be go to say gosh i just can not find the reason in this record it be all too muddle if they want to take that risk what in the statute prevent it no but i mean substantial evidence review require reason if they want to take the risk that their that their minute or their transcript will not allow the district court to do substantial evidence review then you know they will lose as i understand the sg s position the sg say there we be five member of the council three of them talk about the incompatibility of this tower with the neighborhood so what in that statement do you contest do you think that three of them do not base this on the incompatibility of the fake tree with the neighborhood the solicitor general only need one well then you be go to reach the question that justice scalia have a view of which be you know if two people think x and two people think y and one person think z be that sufficient but as long as you have something that three people think why be not that sufficient ms oconnell i think part of mr fisher s argument be that if everyone agree that reason have to be give what sense do it make to require judge to scour the minute and to scour the transcript and to try to make these judgment call about you know when an individual council member have give a reason why not at that point once we be in the mode of require thing why not just require that the reason be state in the two or three sentence that the council or other body promulgates mr carothers i wonder whether what justice alito point out about the nature of local government which you agree with whether that do not suggest that we should try to keep our rule quite simple in other word give that nobody in small local government have access to great lawyer or know a lot about communication that we should just set up a rule that enable them to comply simply and that rule honestly would be mr fisher s rule it would just say in your decision write a sentence or two say why because otherwise if we do not have that rule and every judge have to look through the minute and the transcript and anything else in the record to decide whether a reason be clear enough there be go to be a lot of local government that be go to get kind of caught and the judge be go to say I be sorry it be not clear enough even though if the government have spend just five minute it could have make it clear enough and maybe we should just say do that so that you do not get caught mr fisher suppose that i think that you be right about that but then the question be do congress require that and i take it that the sg be really say no congress require reason it require that by say that there be substantial evidence review but that it do not require the reason to be in any particular form and indeed there have a saving clause which say that all doubt go to the state and local government in this area so notwithstanding that this be go to actually get state and local government into some trouble and notwithstanding that district court be go to struggle with it we should go with the sg s rule rather than with yours ,240.61,Roberts Court,"Nov 10, 2014","T-Mobile South, LLC","City of Roswell, Georgia",13-975,"May 5, 2014","Jan 14, 2015",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2014,Kerry v. Din,114,Elena Kagan,"I don't see why that doesn't cut the other way, Mr. Kneedler. You make this argument several times in your briefs. But I would think that review would be at its nadir in the waiver authority because there, enormous amount of discretion is given to the executive official. Whereas with respect to consular decisions over visas, Congress has set out clear rules for what those consular officials are supposed to be doing. And it seems to me that the reason for review in that context where you're trying to figure out whether the consular official has, in fact, accorded with the congressional determination of who's entitled and who's not to a visa would be all the more important. Well, do you have to -- I mean, what's the level of generality or specificity that you have to cite? Suppose they just said, well, you know, this was done under 1182. Would that be sufficient? We did this under the INA. Is that facially legitimate? So really, it's a reason that's not a reason at all. At some point, I mean, that's nice, you did it under the INA. And that counts as facially legitimate? Mr. Haddad -- -- can -- can I ask you how exactly this case become this kind of constitutional case? Because I had thought that originally this case was brought as an APA challenge, and that it was kind of converted into this constitutional claim by the Ninth Circuit. Is -- is that an incorrect understanding? If it -- Mr. Haddad, suppose -- you know, suppose that I agree with you that the Mandel standard should apply, so it's facially legitimate and bona fide. Why isn't that met here? Why hasn't the government actually come up with a facially legitimate reason when it said 1182(a)(3)(B)? Well, gosh, I would have thought that it can't be a legitimate application of the statute unless you knew why it was being applied; but the facially legitimate actually is a lesser standard than that. It's just like, you know, on its face. On its face, it's legitimate because they are acting under the authority that the law gives them, according to them. I would have thought that all these kind of parade of horribles could have been played out from the Mandel case as well, that you would have thought, oh, my gosh, we're giving all these professors a chance to complain about people going to prison because the professors want to be able to talk to them. And none of that, of course, ever happened. And I'm wondering, why do you think that is? Is there any difference between the two situations such that we need to worry about the parade of horribles in one but not in the other? Law professors are very, very insistent, you know? Can I ask, Mr. Haddad -- and this goes back to my earlier question about why this isn't an APA case -- it seems to me if it were an APA case, we wouldn't have to go through all this -- these troubles about defining the scope of the right. We could just say, this is a person aggrieved, for obvious reasons, that she can't live with her husband, and then sort of go on to ask what kind of process she would do under the APA. Why wouldn't that be an easier way to think about this case and to resolve this case? You know, I think you're over-reading O'Bannon, Mr. Kneedler. I think O'Bannon makes it very clear that -- a large part of what's going on there is, it said the nursing home can do this itself. It was almost like a Prudential Standing kind of argument, that there's one party that has all this motivation and incentive to challenge this; we don't need all these other people doing it. And that's clearly not the case here. So I think O'Bannon is a very different factual circumstance. Well, in those circumstances. ",i do not see why that do not cut the other way mr kneedler you make this argument several time in your brief but i would think that review would be at its nadir in the waiver authority because there enormous amount of discretion be give to the executive official whereas with respect to consular decision over visa congress have set out clear rule for what those consular official be suppose to be do and it seem to me that the reason for review in that context where you be try to figure out whether the consular official have in fact accord with the congressional determination of who be entitle and who be not to a visa would be all the more important well do you have to i mean what be the level of generality or specificity that you have to cite suppose they just say well you know this be do under would that be sufficient we do this under the ina be that facially legitimate so really it be a reason that be not a reason at all at some point i mean that be nice you do it under the ina and that count as facially legitimate mr haddad can can i ask you how exactly this case become this kind of constitutional case because i have think that originally this case be bring as an apa challenge and that it be kind of convert into this constitutional claim by the ninth circuit be be that an incorrect understanding if it mr haddad suppose you know suppose that i agree with you that the mandel standard should apply so it be facially legitimate and bona fide why be not that meet here why have not the government actually come up with a facially legitimate reason when it say a b well gosh i would have think that it can not be a legitimate application of the statute unless you know why it be be apply but the facially legitimate actually be a less standard than that it be just like you know on its face on its face it be legitimate because they be act under the authority that the law give them accord to them i would have think that all these kind of parade of horribles could have be play out from the mandel case as well that you would have think oh my gosh we be give all these professor a chance to complain about people go to prison because the professor want to be able to talk to them and none of that of course ever happen and I be wonder why do you think that be be there any difference between the two situation such that we need to worry about the parade of horribles in one but not in the other law professor be very very insistent you know can i ask mr haddad and this go back to my early question about why this be not an apa case it seem to me if it we be an apa case we would not have to go through all this these trouble about define the scope of the right we could just say this be a person aggrieve for obvious reason that she can not live with her husband and then sort of go on to ask what kind of process she would do under the apa why would not that be an easy way to think about this case and to resolve this case you know i think you be over read obannon mr kneedler i think obannon make it very clear that a large part of what be go on there be it say the nursing home can do this itself it be almost like a prudential standing kind of argument that there be one party that have all this motivation and incentive to challenge this we do not need all these other people do it and that be clearly not the case here so i think obannon be a very different factual circumstance well in those circumstance ,204.66,Roberts Court,"Feb 23, 2015","John Kerry, Secretary of State",Fauzia Din,13-1402,"Oct 2, 2014","Jun 15, 2015",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2014,"Omnicare, Inc. v. Laborers District Council Construction Industry Pension Fund",114,Elena Kagan,"Well, Mr. Shanmugam, suppose-- --Mr. Shanmugam, suppose that in a particular registration statement there was a statement that said a particular kind of transaction was lawful, all right, and the person who makes that statement, whoever it is, really believes it. But, in fact, that person knows that the Government is breathing down his neck, that the Government seems to have a different view. That person knows that its competitors have a different view. And that person has also consulted three lawyers, and two of them have given a different view. But he still believes what he believes. He believes that the Supreme Court is going to vindicate his legal position. But the only thing he says is, I think this is lawful. Now, why isn't that something where there is an omission that makes the statements misleading? Well, it just says statements therein. It doesn't actually say statements of material fact or not. Well, it didn't it didn't impose an obligation to speak, but once you speak, it said that you're that you can't make omissions that make your speech your statements misleading. And I guess what I'm saying is, you know, what I've given you is a case where this is a judgment call, whether you think something is legal or not. But what you know and after all you're in the position to know and all your readers are not in the position to know. What you know is that the Government seems to disagree, that your competitors seem to disagree, and that most of the lawyers seem to disagree. And still you're going to put this in your statement and say, oh, no problem, that's not misleading. But don't you think a reasonable reader would look at that statement and say two things actually: Both, he's done something to try to check as to whether the transaction is legal, and he doesn't know anything that's very dispositive going the other way. And both of those things, I mean, could be false. But I don't think, Mr. Shanmugam, that the fact that the statue has is a strict liability statute might cut the other way. Why is it a strict liability statute? Because Congress had some understanding, number one, that it was the issuer who knows the facts, not the readers; and number two, that it is awfully hard to show subjective intent. That doesn't make much sense to me. A statement is made truly or falsely at the time it's made. So how can you rely on evidence of what happened later? We would never have closure on a securites action if we would rely solely on the fact that the buliding fell down ten years hence. Isn't that exactly what you have here? Because if you look at these registration statements, you know, we have been looking at one or two sentences in a vacuum, but, in fact, if you look at the registration statements themselves, they're sort of surrounded by reasons to discount the opinion. It says, you know, CMS, the government might think differently, and if that's so, we're really in bad shape. It says, these laws may be interpreted in the future in a manner inconsistent with our interpretation. I mean, it seems to me that they actually did a pretty good job of saying, look, we think this, but there are there are some problems-- --with this and it could go the other way. Could I just make sure I understand, Mr. Goldstein? The basis of your argument in the text is not the untrue statement of material facts language, right? Because I would take it that you agree with the government and with Mr. Shanmugam that as to that, the only untrue statement in an opinion is whether you hold it? But the basis of your view, both as to agreeing with the government and also suggesting that a further view is the omissions language; is that right? Do you think that there are specific omissions in this case? Ms. Saharsky, does this affect not only the private right of action? I was uncertain whether it also affected the SEC's ability to stop a registration statement which it thought had a misleading statement of opinion. If we come out the way Mr. Shanmugam says, is the SEC's ability to do that severely compromised? But there might be omitted facts, such as I didn't check with any of my lawyers, or I checked with my lawyers and they told me the opposite. I mean, those are facts, and that's the thing that makes the statement in the registration statement itself misleading. But I think what Ms. Saharsky is saying, maybe not Mr. Goldstein, is that there's another part of the statute which is omissions, and that those omissions of facts I didn't check with anybody or I checked with everybody and they said the exact opposite that's the thing that makes my own statement misleading, and that's why it fits within the statute. ",well mr shanmugam suppose mr shanmugam suppose that in a particular registration statement there be a statement that say a particular kind of transaction be lawful all right and the person who make that statement whoever it be really believe it but in fact that person know that the government be breathe down his neck that the government seem to have a different view that person know that its competitor have a different view and that person have also consult three lawyer and two of them have give a different view but he still believe what he believe he believe that the supreme court be go to vindicate his legal position but the only thing he say be i think this be lawful now why be not that something where there be an omission that make the statement mislead well it just say statement therein it do not actually say statement of material fact or not well it do not it do not impose an obligation to speak but once you speak it say that you be that you can not make omission that make your speech your statement mislead and i guess what I be say be you know what I have give you be a case where this be a judgment call whether you think something be legal or not but what you know and after all you be in the position to know and all your reader be not in the position to know what you know be that the government seem to disagree that your competitor seem to disagree and that most of the lawyer seem to disagree and still you be go to put this in your statement and say oh no problem that be not misleading but do not you think a reasonable reader would look at that statement and say two thing actually both he be do something to try to check as to whether the transaction be legal and he do not know anything that be very dispositive go the other way and both of those thing i mean could be false but i do not think mr shanmugam that the fact that the statue have be a strict liability statute might cut the other way why be it a strict liability statute because congress have some understanding number one that it be the issuer who know the fact not the reader and number two that it be awfully hard to show subjective intent that do not make much sense to me a statement be make truly or falsely at the time it be make so how can you rely on evidence of what happen later we would never have closure on a securites action if we would rely solely on the fact that the buliding fell down ten year hence be not that exactly what you have here because if you look at these registration statement you know we have be look at one or two sentence in a vacuum but in fact if you look at the registration statement themselves they be sort of surround by reason to discount the opinion it say you know cm the government might think differently and if that be so we be really in bad shape it say these law may be interpret in the future in a manner inconsistent with our interpretation i mean it seem to me that they actually do a pretty good job of say look we think this but there be there be some problem with this and it could go the other way could i just make sure i understand mr goldstein the basis of your argument in the text be not the untrue statement of material fact language right because i would take it that you agree with the government and with mr shanmugam that as to that the only untrue statement in an opinion be whether you hold it but the basis of your view both as to agree with the government and also suggest that a further view be the omission language be that right do you think that there be specific omission in this case ms saharsky do this affect not only the private right of action i be uncertain whether it also affect the sec s ability to stop a registration statement which it think have a misleading statement of opinion if we come out the way mr shanmugam say be the sec s ability to do that severely compromise but there might be omit fact such as i do not check with any of my lawyer or i check with my lawyer and they tell me the opposite i mean those be fact and that be the thing that make the statement in the registration statement itself mislead but i think what ms saharsky be say maybe not mr goldstein be that there be another part of the statute which be omission and that those omission of fact i do not check with anybody or i check with everybody and they say the exact opposite that be the thing that make my own statement misleading and that be why it fit within the statute ,280.36,Roberts Court,"Nov 3, 2014","Omnicare, Inc. et al.","Indiana State District Council of Laborers and Hod Carriers Pension and Welfare Fund, et al.",13-435,"Mar 3, 2014","Mar 24, 2015",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2014,Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, Mr. Clement, how about that, because I thought that the legislature was completely cut out as to most of those things. I mean, you take the 2011 law in Mississippi adopting voter ID requirements; 2007, Oregon, voting by mail; 1962, Arkansas, use of voting machines. All of things -- these things were done by referendum or by initiative with the legislative process completely cut out. So would all of those be unconstitutional as well? And we can go further. I mean, there are zillions of these laws. Well, they're not delegations or non-delegations. All they are is laws that are passed not through the legislative process. Not through the legislature. No, but, I mean, my gosh. I would think that if your primary argument is legislature means legislature, that there has to be a legislative control, in none of these laws is there legislative control. There's no legislative participation at all. Well, how do you -- how do you make that consistent with the text that you are -- the textual argument that you are making? The textual argument that you are making is legislature means legislature. There's no two ways around that. But now you're saying that there are these many, many, many laws throughout the United States in which the rules are not being made by a legislature. And that's perfectly okay because the legislature isn't involved at all. Well, I thought that the -- that generally in our separation of powers jurisprudence, abdication is just as consequential as aggrandizement. In other words, it doesn't matter what the legislature wants. The legislature could have said, oh, that's fine, go do it, we don't care about it. If there is a problem, the problem continues to exist irrespective of whether the legislature protests or not. So tell me, Mr. Clement, there's -- the State sets up this independent commission and the independent commission has a veto power on the State's redistricting. In other words, the State can do redistricting and then it submits it to the independent commission, and the independent commission can say, No, go back, do it again. They have the vote. That's -- that's who has the veto, the independent commission. Does it matter? Well, kind of it doesn't, right, because there's a veto at the end of it. All right. I'll take out the ""kind of."" It doesn't. There's a veto at the end of this. But that's what -- so this is what we're going to have to do for every time that they set up some process in which there's some independent commission involvement, what we're going to have to ask is what exactly? No. That's -- that's just -- I mean tell me exactly how we're going to decide all these cases in which an advisory commission plays some role, but -- not -- not just some role, a very, very serious role, but there's a little piece that's left to the legislature. What if the commission says, We're going to give you two maps, the legislature has to pick one and only one? But you see, Mr. Clement, that suggests a very pure rule and -- and on occasion you said something like this, a legislature means a legislature, and that's what it means, and so a legislature has to do all those things. But you've made many, many exemptions to that over the course of the last 20 minutes. You've said that as to anything that's not redistricting, it can be done by referendum or initiative without any legislative process whatsoever. You've said that all these kinds of different schemes about the interaction between a legislature and advisory commission are all going to be have to reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the legislature has primary control. And when you get through with all that, the sort of purity of the originalist argument that a legislature means a legislature, well, we are miles away from that, aren't we? But I would think, Mr. Clement, that the overriding principle of Smiley and Hildebrant and Hawke is that when it comes to this particular provision, and this particular provision as compared to the Seventeenth Amendment, which is the comparison and the contrast that Hawke sets up, when it comes to this particular provision, we need to show a lot of respect to the State's own decisions about how legislative power ought to be exercised. And that seems to me the overriding principle of the three cases. But, of course, you can turn that around and say what that provision shows is really exactly what I just said, is that Congress was also on board with this idea that the Court had, that when you look at that clause, the Elections Clause, that a lot of respect, a lot of deference, has to be given to the State's own definition. ",well mr clement how about that because i think that the legislature be completely cut out as to most of those thing i mean you take the law in mississippi adopt voter id requirement oregon voting by mail arkansas use of vote machine all of thing these thing we be do by referendum or by initiative with the legislative process completely cut out so would all of those be unconstitutional as well and we can go far i mean there be zillion of these law well they be not delegation or non delegation all they be be law that be pass not through the legislative process not through the legislature no but i mean my gosh i would think that if your primary argument be legislature mean legislature that there have to be a legislative control in none of these law be there legislative control there be no legislative participation at all well how do you how do you make that consistent with the text that you be the textual argument that you be make the textual argument that you be make be legislature mean legislature there be no two way around that but now you be say that there be these many many many law throughout the united state in which the rule be not be make by a legislature and that be perfectly okay because the legislature be not involve at all well i think that the that generally in our separation of power jurisprudence abdication be just as consequential as aggrandizement in other word it do not matter what the legislature want the legislature could have say oh that be fine go do it we do not care about it if there be a problem the problem continue to exist irrespective of whether the legislature protest or not so tell me mr clement there be the state set up this independent commission and the independent commission have a veto power on the state s redistricting in other word the state can do redistricting and then it submit it to the independent commission and the independent commission can say no go back do it again they have the vote that have that be who have the veto the independent commission do it matter well kind of it do not right because there be a veto at the end of it all right I will take out the kind of it do not there be a veto at the end of this but that be what so this be what we be go to have to do for every time that they set up some process in which there be some independent commission involvement what we be go to have to ask be what exactly no that be that be just i mean tell me exactly how we be go to decide all these case in which an advisory commission play some role but not not just some role a very very serious role but there be a little piece that be leave to the legislature what if the commission say we be go to give you two map the legislature have to pick one and only one but you see mr clement that suggest a very pure rule and and on occasion you say something like this a legislature mean a legislature and that be what it mean and so a legislature have to do all those thing but you have make many many exemption to that over the course of the last minute you have say that as to anything that be not redistricting it can be do by referendum or initiative without any legislative process whatsoever you have say that all these kind of different scheme about the interaction between a legislature and advisory commission be all go to be have to review on a case by case basis to determine whether the legislature have primary control and when you get through with all that the sort of purity of the originalist argument that a legislature mean a legislature well we be mile away from that be not we but i would think mr clement that the override principle of smiley and hildebrant and hawke be that when it come to this particular provision and this particular provision as compare to the seventeenth amendment which be the comparison and the contrast that hawke set up when it come to this particular provision we need to show a lot of respect to the state s own decision about how legislative power ought to be exercise and that seem to me the override principle of the three case but of course you can turn that around and say what that provision show be really exactly what i just say be that congress be also on board with this idea that the court have that when you look at that clause the election clause that a lot of respect a lot of deference have to be give to the state s own definition ,274.61,Roberts Court,"Mar 2, 2015",,,13-1314,"Oct 2, 2014","Jun 29, 2015",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2014,Warger v. Shauers,114,Elena Kagan,"I guess I don't understand that, Mr. Shanmugam. I mean, one reason that a verdict can be invalid has to do with what happens in the jury room. And another reason why a verdict can be invalid might have to do with the composition of the jury itself. And why we should read that language to include the first but not the second I guess I'm just not getting as a matter of language. I know, but -- so maybe we're just going back and forth here. But an inquiry into the validity of the verdict means asking the question, is the verdict valid? And the question, is the verdict valid, can have answers that refer either to the deliberative process itself or to the composition of the jury. Well, do you think that with respect to the kind of case that Justice Alito has in mind, a case of racial bias and let's put it in a criminal context, that maybe it's not up to Congress, that at some point one begins to run into constitutional issues? I suppose one idea -- because we have relied a lot on the efficacy of other safeguards, and this isn't this case, so you can just say it's not this case. But -- that those safeguards might not be so effective in certain contexts and particularly with respect to ferreting out racial bias or religious or ethnic or something like that.

2014,"Mach Mining, LLC v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission",114,Elena Kagan,"Well, but at the same time, Mr. Goldstein, and this really follows up on Justice Kennedy's question, the statute makes entirely clear that the EEOC has the prerogative to decide what kind of offer by the employer is acceptable or not. And there's nothing to suggest that the EEOC even has to be reasonable in determining what sort of offer by the employer is acceptable. Mr. Goldstein, could we talk about that confidentiality provision? Because in addition to just the enormous discretion that this statute gives to the EEOC, the other thing that tends to work against you is this thing: Nothing said or done as part of these informal endeavors can be used as evidence in a subsequent proceeding. And your entire position would have all the stuff about this conciliation come in as evidence in a subsequent proceeding, which is to say, come in as evidence in the litigation of the lawsuit. I'm just saying as a matter of fact-- --there is discretion in the sense that the statute clearly gives it to the EEOC to decide what's acceptable in the end. Yes. But you yourself are making this part of the case. You're essentially saying that the EEOC has to come in and prove that it conciliated in good faith or whatever term you want. So it's become now, by virtue of your own argument, part of the case. And how is that to be part of the case and how is all this to happen unless the informal what's said and done in the informal endeavors come in. I don't even understand that distinction. You're making it a part of the merits. I would have thought that the point of the provision is very clear. It's the same point as anything which says when you're involved in settlement negotiations those stay in settlement negotiations, and it's to protect the settle -- the integrity of the negotiations. It's a rule of brief writing, right? Exactly. It does -- I mean, here are two preconditions to endeavoring to conciliate a claim, right? One is we actually told them what we were objecting to, and the second is we talked. So could we just have the EEOC come in with an affidavit saying, we told them what we were objecting to and we talked and it didn't work? Okay. Talked or-- --communicated. But you would not object to that; is that right? No, no, no. But then, yes, to the extent-- --that -- so this goes back to the Chief Justice's first question. To the extent that somebody comes in and says either they never told me what this case was about -- that is, they never told me what the claim was -- or they never communicated with me, that that would be a fair thing to review that doesn't get into your sort of spiraling out of control, what -- you know, how hard did you try, and what positions did you take-- --But just we told them what the claim is, and we talked about the claim. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Do you want them to put their minimum offer on the table? That's a necessary part of conciliation? That is intrusive. I mean, you're doing your best job of proving Ms. Saharsky's point here, because you're saying they have to put all the reasons on the table, they have to say why it is that they're asking for what it is that they're asking for, they have to say, you know, what they would be -- the only -- the last thing that they would find acceptable.

2014,Zivotofsky v. Kerry,114,Elena Kagan,"But if -- if -- if -- Congress then passed a law saying that that statement had to come off the passport, could Congress do that? Ms. Lewin, if I can ask you, if your primary position is that this is not a recognition statute, can we talk a little bit about what it is? I mean, why -- what -- what is the design, what is the effect of this statute other than as something that goes to recognition? But the United States Government does not usually give people that right to self-identify in this way. In other words, I think this was the Chief Justice's question in the first argument, if you're an American citizen born in Northern Ireland, you can't get the right to say Ireland. For that matter, if you are an American citizen born in Jerusalem today, you can't get the rights to say Palestine. This is a very selective vanity plate law, if we might call it that. And -- and it's selective because Congress had, it appears to me, and it's consistent with the rest of the statute, as Justice Ginsburg said, a real view that this was the self-identification it wanted. In other words, the ability of American citizens to say yes, I was born in Jerusalem, and that means I was born in Israel. That and only that self-identification is allowed. Now, people can -- Palestinians cannot -- American-born Palestinians cannot do that. And that suggests that Congress had a view, and the view was that Jerusalem was properly part of Israel. Can I -- can I give you a hypothetical, Ms. Lewin? Suppose that Congress passed a law and this law said that the Secretary of State had to send an official letter to all foreign ministers whenever a U.S. citizen was born in Jerusalem, and that official letter from the Secretary of State said says just -- it announces that a new American has been born in Israel. Would that be constitutional? This is a law passed by Congress and it says every time a U.S. citizen is born in Jerusalem, the Secretary of State has to send an official letter to every other foreign minister saying that a new American has been born in Israel. That would be constitutional, even though the -- the Congress is basically telling the Secretary of State to engage in a certain kind of diplomatic communication with other foreign countries. Yes, exactly right. That was going to be my point, that it was-- [Laughter] --that it was extremely similar to what a passport does, that both are forms of diplomatic communication, and that what we usually say about diplomatic communication is that whatever Congress's other foreign affairs powers are, the power of diplomatic communication belongs to the President and the President alone; that in that realm we only speak with one voice. And so I guess I have to sort of say that that answer that you gave me, that this could -- that Congress could say to the Secretary of State, here's the diplomatic communication that you have to send to other foreign ministers, seems, well, a little bit shocking. Well, if you say that-- --Ms. Lewin, may I just I know your time is -- but if I might just go back to the thought that the Chief Justice gave you that you agreed with. Here's the way a passport begins. It begins, ""The Secretary of State of the United States of America hereby requests all who it may concern to permit the citizen. "" blah, blah, blah. That's what that's the -- you know, the Secretary of State requests all of these who are going to be looking at this passport. And then in Haig v. Agee, we described a passport as a letter of introduction in which the issuing sovereign vouches for the bearer and requests other sovereigns to aid the bearer. So this is, this passport, it seems, both on what it says itself and on what we've said about it, it's like a letter from the Secretary of State. It's a communication. I take it, Ms. Lewin, when you say the West Bank, I take it you think that Congress could pass the identical statute with respect to a child born in Hebron, say. That that, too, is Israel? Yes. Okay. Can I say that this seems a particularly unfortunate week to be making this kind of, ""oh, it's no big deal. "" argument. I mean, history suggests that everything is a big deal with respect to the status of Jerusalem. And right now Jerusalem is a tinderbox because of issues about the status of and access to a particularly holy site there. And so sort of everything matters, doesn't it? ",but if if if congress then pass a law say that that statement have to come off the passport could congress do that ms lewin if i can ask you if your primary position be that this be not a recognition statute can we talk a little bit about what it be i mean why what what be the design what be the effect of this statute other than as something that go to recognition but the united state government do not usually give people that right to self identify in this way in other word i think this be the chief justice s question in the first argument if you be an american citizen bear in northern ireland you can not get the right to say ireland for that matter if you be an american citizen bear in jerusalem today you can not get the right to say palestine this be a very selective vanity plate law if we might call it that and and it be selective because congress have it appear to me and it be consistent with the rest of the statute as justice ginsburg say a real view that this be the self identification it want in other word the ability of american citizen to say yes i be bear in jerusalem and that mean i be bear in israel that and only that self identification be allow now people can palestinians can not american born palestinian can not do that and that suggest that congress have a view and the view be that jerusalem be properly part of israel can i can i give you a hypothetical ms lewin suppose that congress pass a law and this law say that the secretary of state have to send an official letter to all foreign minister whenever a us citizen be bear in jerusalem and that official letter from the secretary of state say say just it announce that a new american have be bear in israel would that be constitutional this be a law pass by congress and it say every time a us citizen be bear in jerusalem the secretary of state have to send an official letter to every other foreign minister say that a new american have be bear in israel that would be constitutional even though the the congress be basically tell the secretary of state to engage in a certain kind of diplomatic communication with other foreign country yes exactly right that be go to be my point that it be laughter that it be extremely similar to what a passport do that both be form of diplomatic communication and that what we usually say about diplomatic communication be that whatever congress s other foreign affair power be the power of diplomatic communication belongs to the president and the president alone that in that realm we only speak with one voice and so i guess i have to sort of say that that answer that you give me that this could that congress could say to the secretary of state here s the diplomatic communication that you have to send to other foreign minister seem well a little bit shock well if you say that ms lewin may i just i know your time be but if i might just go back to the thought that the chief justice give you that you agree with here s the way a passport begin it begin the secretary of state of the united state of america hereby request all who it may concern to permit the citizen blah blah blah that be what that be the you know the secretary of state request all of these who be go to be look at this passport and then in haig v agee we describe a passport as a letter of introduction in which the issuing sovereign vouches for the bearer and request other sovereign to aid the bearer so this be this passport it seem both on what it say itself and on what we have say about it it be like a letter from the secretary of state it be a communication i take it ms lewin when you say the west bank i take it you think that congress could pass the identical statute with respect to a child bear in hebron say that that too be israel yes okay can i say that this seem a particularly unfortunate week to be make this kind of oh it be no big deal argument i mean history suggest that everything be a big deal with respect to the status of jerusalem and right now jerusalem be a tinderbox because of issue about the status of and access to a particularly holy site there and so sort of everything matter do not it ,279.20999999999987,Roberts Court,"Nov 3, 2014","M.

2014,Johnson v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"But if I understand the government's argument, it's that there's a very strong correlation between possession in this case and use for criminal purposes of a kind that clearly would pose a risk of -- of violent conduct and injury. So are you saying that we never can take that kind of correlation into account, that possession crimes just have to be treated in a box, and we can't think about whether the possession of something increases the risk of use which then will pose a serious risk of injury? So -- so that seems right, that it's a question to pose to the government. It's like, what's in back of this correlation? But is your argument, then, they haven't made their empirical case or even if they had lots of statistics, it still wouldn't be enough? When you say “ constructive possession ”, what does that mean? I would think the analogy to that is the person who uses the sawed-off shotgun in a crime, but decides: I'm not going to shoot it. And then you say: It doesn't really matter if you're not going to shoot it; you just used it in a criminal activity, that's enough for us. But this is a good deal more attenuated than that because this person could, for whatever reason, maybe because he wants to commit a crime in the future or maybe he's one of the odd collectors or people who think that this is good for self-defense, this person could have kept it in a locked closet, in a safe deposit box, and never have brought it out and never have any potential for use in a crime. I mean, it would be one thing to say use in a crime causes enough risk of serious injury, but this is a step further. But they are two separate offenses, right, possession of this gun and use of the gun. And you're converting the one into the other for purposes of ACCA. Do you think the same would be true of a felon in possession? I don't think that in the felon -- a felon in possession law, I mean, honestly, I'm sure the numbers dwarf the sawed-off shotguns, and the whole point of that is, yes, they're people who have shown themselves to be irresponsible, who have shown themselves perhaps to use weapons irresponsibly, and they're going to do it again, and there's a pretty strong correlation of a kind of recidivism that makes Congress pass that law. ",but if i understand the government s argument it be that there be a very strong correlation between possession in this case and use for criminal purpose of a kind that clearly would pose a risk of of violent conduct and injury so be you say that we never can take that kind of correlation into account that possession crimes just have to be treat in a box and we can not think about whether the possession of something increase the risk of use which then will pose a serious risk of injury so so that seem right that it be a question to pose to the government it be like what be in back of this correlation but be your argument then they have not make their empirical case or even if they have lot of statistic it still would not be enough when you say constructive possession what do that mean i would think the analogy to that be the person who use the saw off shotgun in a crime but decide I be not go to shoot it and then you say it do not really matter if you be not go to shoot it you just use it in a criminal activity that be enough for us but this be a good deal more attenuated than that because this person could for whatever reason maybe because he want to commit a crime in the future or maybe he be one of the odd collector or people who think that this be good for self defense this person could have keep it in a locked closet in a safe deposit box and never have bring it out and never have any potential for use in a crime i mean it would be one thing to say use in a crime cause enough risk of serious injury but this be a step far but they be two separate offense right possession of this gun and use of the gun and you be convert the one into the other for purpose of acca do you think the same would be true of a felon in possession i do not think that in the felon a felon in possession law i mean honestly I be sure the number dwarf the saw off shotgun and the whole point of that be yes they be people who have show themselves to be irresponsible who have show themselves perhaps to use weapon irresponsibly and they be go to do it again and there be a pretty strong correlation of a kind of recidivism that make congress pas that law ,134.38000000000002,Roberts Court,"Nov 5, 2014",Samuel Johnson,United States,13-7120,"Apr 21, 2014","Jun 26, 2015",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

2014,Whitfield v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"But your first -- when you just said it's not de minimis, is that your primary argument? You just want a non-de minimis rule? You might be right that it's the heart of what Congress was trying to get at, but this happens all the time when Congress writes statutes, right? It thinks about a particular case, it has an idea in its mind of the sort of conduct that they mean, which is this John Dillinger example, but then when it gets down to drafting the words it writes words that are broader than that, that include things that are not in the front of their minds, like this one. Do you think there's-- --But that's what you are going to lead it to, Mr. Fletcher, it's just going to be prosecutorial good judgment that's going to separate the case that's, like, could you come with me a couple of feet. Right. I guess I'm asking you is there anything else. Would you -- you think that there should not be a de minimis exception at all. I'm asking about a de minimis exception. When Congress first drafted this accompanying language, this was a capital offense, yes? So, I mean, would you say the same thing if it were still a capital offense? I guess I was just suggesting that maybe we should take that into account in thinking about what Congress could have meant for this statute to mean, but it seems -- it -- it seems very unlikely that Congress meant to give the death penalty to somebody who forced another person to move two feet.

2014,Yates v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"But could I go back to Justice Ginsburg's first question, because, my fault I'm sure, but I wasn't sure I understood your answer. Not only in 1512(c)(1), but there are, you know, I think five times in 1512 from a prior enactment this same kind of phrase is used, which is “ record document and other object ”. And you say that we should treat that phrase as it exists many times in 1512 differently from this phrase in 1519 because of the difference between tangible object and other object. And to me, it seems like other object is, if anything, a more classic case of that canon that I can't pronounce the name of, ejusdem whatever. [Laughter] Good. That's what I count on my colleague for. [Laughter] I -- I deserved that. But to me, it seems like a more -- even a more classic case. So I guess I just don't understand why you're treating the two differently. But just because Congress includes more verbs -- I mean, the reason Congress includes 20 verbs instead of 4 is presumably because Congress really wants to sweep in a very wide variety of conduct. And not every verb has to apply to every situation. In fact, we rather presume that they won't. So your whole argument here really comes down to the fact that Congress put some record-related verbs in there? But I would think -- I'm sorry. I would think that that cuts against you, that the fact that this is about any matter within the jurisdiction of any agency in the United States shows that it's really not just about corporate fraud, that Congress had a broader set of things in mind. So I would think that that's -- that's quite the opposite, that everything about this statute, the “ any matter ”, the “ any record ”, suggests breadth. Well, then why is that absurd? If you concede that that would have been covered, the catch logs, and the prosecutor is trying to do the exact same thing, it's just that he's thrown over a different piece of evidence, why is that such a crazy outcome? But that clearly falls within the statute. I mean, you can't argue that it doesn't. So-- --You know, it seems as though this is -- Congress gives very strict penalties to lots of minor things, and -- but that's, you know, that's what it does. Could -- could you tell me, Mr. Martinez, where are those other provisions? I -- I think that there are about five of them in 1512. I take it there are many State statutes, are there? Are there other Federal statutes? That's okay. ",but could i go back to justice ginsburg s first question because my fault I be sure but i be not sure i understand your answer not only in c but there be you know i think five time in from a prior enactment this same kind of phrase be use which be record document and other object and you say that we should treat that phrase as it exist many time in differently from this phrase in because of the difference between tangible object and other object and to me it seem like other object be if anything a more classic case of that canon that i can not pronounce the name of ejusdem whatever laughter good that be what i count on my colleague for laughter i i deserve that but to me it seem like a more even a more classic case so i guess i just do not understand why you be treat the two differently but just because congress include more verbs i mean the reason congress include verb instead of be presumably because congress really want to sweep in a very wide variety of conduct and not every verb have to apply to every situation in fact we rather presume that they will not so your whole argument here really come down to the fact that congress put some record relate verb in there but i would think I be sorry i would think that that cut against you that the fact that this be about any matter within the jurisdiction of any agency in the united state show that it be really not just about corporate fraud that congress have a broad set of thing in mind so i would think that that be that be quite the opposite that everything about this statute the any matter the any record suggest breadth well then why be that absurd if you concede that that would have be cover the catch log and the prosecutor be try to do the exact same thing it be just that he be throw over a different piece of evidence why be that such a crazy outcome but that clearly fall within the statute i mean you can not argue that it do not so you know it seem as though this be congress give very strict penalty to lot of minor thing and but that be you know that be what it do could could you tell me mr martinez where be those other provision i i think that there be about five of them in i take it there be many state statute be there be there other federal statute that be okay ,167.90000000000003,Roberts Court,"Nov 5, 2014",John L.

2014,"Baker Botts, LLP v. ASARCO, LLC",114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Oldham, you -- you agree, don't you, that in this system, the court can do enhancements? Yes. Yeah. So some of the things that we've said are permissible for enhancements are exceptional delays in payment, extraordinary outlays of expenses, and unusually protracted litigation -- okay? -- that those count as enhancements. We said that in Perdue v. Kenny A. Why isn't this just like that? No, no, no. But I'm proceeding on the assumption of -- on the SG's assumption that what we're trying to do is to get a reasonable rate for the services that clearly have been authorized. And the question is: What's a reasonable rate? And it seems to me that what this statute does is to say ""reasonable"" can include, like, lots of things. It's highly discretionary. Right? And then on top of that, you know, it -- included in ""what is reasonable"" is this idea of sometimes you can do performance enhancements, but we haven't said performance enhancements are just for super-duper work. We've actually said performance enhancements are for things like unusually protracted litigation and lots of expenses and exceptional delays, sort of like this. You know, this is just an expense of your work, is having to go after the fees. So why doesn't that get into the mix, too? No, it does, because the text just says ""reasonable."" And then the question is what's reasonable? And ""reasonable"" can include, you know, you're getting the same hourly rate as some other lawyer, but ""reasonable"" is, also, you had to do this over a very extended period of time and ""reasonable"" is, also, boy, you had to spend a lot of money in order to get them to pay you anything at all. All of those things count as what's part of ""reasonable."" Yeah, it's reasonable for all the other work you're doing. But then everything else goes into this question of reasonable, right? Is -- you know, I'll give you a hypothetical. Suppose I hire somebody to shovel my driveway, and I say, I'm going to give you reasonable compensation. And everybody knows that it's $10 an hour to hire my driveway, right? That's the going rate. But then I say, oh, did I not tell you -- did I not tell you I'm going to make you go down -- come down to the court so that I can pay you the $10? And that costs another $5. All right? Now, it strikes me that if somebody said, what's reasonable compensation now, it would be $15. It wouldn't be $10. And it's the exact same thing here. It's like by the time you go through all this stuff that you have to go through to get paid, you should get paid more. But it doesn't say you can't get paid for it. There's no exclusion. All, you know -- you know, I think you and the SG agree, it's -- we're not counting this as the service. What we're saying is you have to be reasonably paid for the obvious services that you have performed, shoveling my driveway. And in my -- in my hypothetical, that means you also have to be paid for the cab fare. And similarly, here, it means you also have to be paid for the cost of, like, making them sign a check to you. Well, it doesn't have to go be- -- I mean, I just don't understand what that means. It's this -- it's the clear service rendered, it's shoveling my driveway, it's doing the work for the estate. What counts as reasonable? What counts as reasonable is not just the hourly rate, but all the things I've put you through to get the hourly rate. But here's the problem, I think, with that response. It's a reasonable response, but we're already out of the American rule here. I mean, the bankruptcy system puts you in a different universe than a statutory universe, and the question is what do those words of the statute say? It's not what would exist if the statute didn't exist. Well, the American rule can't trump the statute. The statute has to trump the American rule. And if the statute says reasonable compensation for services rendered -- the obvious services rendered, and -- and the only thing that counts as reasonable is taking into account things like how protracted the litigation is and how much risk you've had and the exceptional delay, and the fact that you've had to contest a lot, a lot, a lot of meritless objections, all of those things make for something -- go into the question of what's reasonable. They don't have to. I mean, in 90 percent of the cases, it might be that it's like, no, that's just a normal part of the process. But in that other 10 percent, where it's not a normal part of the process and you wouldn't be reasonably paid unless they were included, it seems to me the word reasonable demands that they be included. ",mr oldham you you agree do not you that in this system the court can do enhancement yes yeah so some of the thing that we have say be permissible for enhancement be exceptional delay in payment extraordinary outlay of expense and unusually protracted litigation okay that those count as enhancement we say that in perdue v kenny a why be not this just like that no no no but I be proceed on the assumption of on the sg s assumption that what we be try to do be to get a reasonable rate for the service that clearly have be authorize and the question be what be a reasonable rate and it seem to me that what this statute do be to say reasonable can include like lot of thing it be highly discretionary right and then on top of that you know it include in what be reasonable be this idea of sometimes you can do performance enhancement but we have not say performance enhancement be just for super duper work we have actually say performance enhancement be for thing like unusually protract litigation and lot of expense and exceptional delay sort of like this you know this be just an expense of your work be have to go after the fee so why do not that get into the mix too no it do because the text just say reasonable and then the question be what be reasonable and reasonable can include you know you be get the same hourly rate as some other lawyer but reasonable be also you have to do this over a very extended period of time and reasonable be also boy you have to spend a lot of money in order to get them to pay you anything at all all of those thing count as what be part of reasonable yeah it be reasonable for all the other work you be do but then everything else go into this question of reasonable right be you know I will give you a hypothetical suppose i hire somebody to shovel my driveway and i say I be go to give you reasonable compensation and everybody know that it be an hour to hire my driveway right that be the go rate but then i say oh do i not tell you do i not tell you I be go to make you go down come down to the court so that i can pay you the and that cost another all right now it strike me that if somebody say what be reasonable compensation now it would be it would not be and it be the exact same thing here it be like by the time you go through all this stuff that you have to go through to get pay you should get pay more but it do not say you can not get pay for it there be no exclusion all you know you know i think you and the sg agree it be we be not count this as the service what we be say be you have to be reasonably pay for the obvious service that you have perform shovel my driveway and in my in my hypothetical that mean you also have to be pay for the cab fare and similarly here it mean you also have to be pay for the cost of like make them sign a check to you well it do not have to go be i mean i just do not understand what that mean it be this it be the clear service render it be shovel my driveway it be do the work for the estate what count as reasonable what count as reasonable be not just the hourly rate but all the thing I have put you through to get the hourly rate but here s the problem i think with that response it be a reasonable response but we be already out of the american rule here i mean the bankruptcy system put you in a different universe than a statutory universe and the question be what do those word of the statute say it be not what would exist if the statute do not exist well the american rule can not trump the statute the statute have to trump the american rule and if the statute say reasonable compensation for service render the obvious service render and and the only thing that count as reasonable be take into account thing like how protracted the litigation be and how much risk you have have and the exceptional delay and the fact that you have have to contest a lot a lot a lot of meritless objection all of those thing make for something go into the question of what be reasonable they do not have to i mean in percent of the case it might be that it be like no that be just a normal part of the process but in that other percent where it be not a normal part of the process and you would not be reasonably pay unless they we be include it seem to me the word reasonable demand that they be include ,277.13,Roberts Court,"Feb 25, 2015","Baker Botts, LLP","ASARCO, LLC",14-103,"Oct 2, 2014","Jun 15, 2015",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2014,"Alabama Department of Revenue v. CSX Transportation, Inc.",114,Elena Kagan,"But, General, I think on -- on this question, CSX 1, I think your reasoning flies straight into the face of it, because CSX 1 talks about the notion that (1) through (3) is very different from (4) and that you can't -- this is just along the lines of what Justice Scalia says -- that you can't draw anything about the meaning of (4) from (1) through (3) given that they clearly -- they use different language, they're directed towards different things. But, you see, when you say “ similarly situated ”, and I think that's right, but that seems to go to your second argument, which is, look, they're not similarly situated because there's another tax that falls upon motor carriers that doesn't fall upon railroads, and that seems to me completely fair and -- but -- but not on the first question. General, one of the things that Mr. Phillips talks about is he -- he makes the point that this is a very hard inquiry to carry out and that the experience of courts, when they try to do this in commerce cases, shows that. So what's your answer to that? Ms. Goldenberg, could I ask, you know, in one set of cases maybe a railroad is saying we're being singled out. In another set of cases a railroad comes in and says no, we're not being singled out but our competitors are being treated better than we are. Are there any other kinds of cases out there or is it mostly just, you know, as compared to the general taxpayer and as compared to competitors? Is there any other way to -- to shape a complaint in this field? Although I do think that might make one of Mr. Phillips' point is that maybe those cases don't fill one with confidence. Is-- --As -- as I understand the court of appeals' judgment as to the truckers, the court of appeals just said it's too complicated, forget it, we're not even going to look at Alabama's argument. Now you're here and you're saying, well, Alabama's argument is too simple. There's a whole raft of other things to -- to include in the analysis of whether that tax on the truckers is, in fact, comparable. But the decision that we have before us just threw up its hands and refused to look at the whole alternative tax issue. That seems, to me, a problem for you, isn't it? Well, doesn't it have to be appropriate as going in that Alabama can say, here's the tax that we impose on truckers? They're really being treated in the exact same way just under two different provisions of the tax code, and then it's up to you to say why that's wrong. But that's not what the court of appeals said. The court of appeals did not say, oh, you know, CSX has convinced us that these are not comparable taxes. Instead, what the court of appeals said is we're not even going to look at whether they are comparable taxes. ",but general i think on on this question csx i think your reason fly straight into the face of it because csx talk about the notion that through be very different from and that you can not this be just along the line of what justice scalia say that you can not draw anything about the meaning of from through give that they clearly they use different language they be directed towards different thing but you see when you say similarly situate and i think that be right but that seem to go to your second argument which be look they be not similarly situate because there be another tax that fall upon motor carrier that do not fall upon railroad and that seem to me completely fair and but but not on the first question general one of the thing that mr phillips talk about be he he make the point that this be a very hard inquiry to carry out and that the experience of court when they try to do this in commerce case show that so what be your answer to that ms goldenberg could i ask you know in one set of case maybe a railroad be say we be be single out in another set of case a railroad come in and say no we be not be single out but our competitor be be treat good than we be be there any other kind of case out there or be it mostly just you know as compare to the general taxpayer and as compare to competitor be there any other way to to shape a complaint in this field although i do think that might make one of mr phillips point be that maybe those case do not fill one with confidence be as as i understand the court of appeal judgment as to the trucker the court of appeal just say it be too complicate forget it we be not even go to look at alabama s argument now you be here and you be say well alabama s argument be too simple there be a whole raft of other thing to to include in the analysis of whether that tax on the trucker be in fact comparable but the decision that we have before us just throw up its hand and refuse to look at the whole alternative tax issue that seem to me a problem for you be not it well do not it have to be appropriate as go in that alabama can say here s the tax that we impose on trucker they be really be treat in the exact same way just under two different provision of the tax code and then it be up to you to say why that be wrong but that be not what the court of appeal say the court of appeal do not say oh you know csx have convince us that these be not comparable tax instead what the court of appeal say be we be not even go to look at whether they be comparable tax ,166.45999999999995,Roberts Court,"Dec 9, 2014","Alabama Department of Revenue, et al.","CSX Transportation, Inc.",13-553,"Jul 1, 2014","Mar 4, 2015",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2014,Davis v. Ayala,114,Elena Kagan,"Ms. Urbanski, let's say that they -- that the Ninth Circuit is wrong in that respect. Let's say that there is an adjudication on the merits here. All right? But I think that that doesn't solve the basic problem of this case. There's an adjudication on the merits, but there are these two prongs; there's the harmlessness prong, and then there's the substantive violation prong, whether a Batson violation occurred. And what the court here said was if a Batson violation occurred, it doesn't matter. It would be harmless. So if you -- for whatever reason, right or wrong -- if you take that harmlessness determination out of the picture, if you say that that was an unreasonable application of law, all right, we're left with essentially a vacuum; right? And so what happens? What does the court do where there's been no finding as to a Bat -- Batson violation? And you're saying that it should kind of make up a reason why there might not have been a Batson violation and -- and go with that. And why is that the proper approach? Well, you only do if the harmlessness determination is an unreasonable application under AEDPA. So if that is an unreasonable application, you face the quandary of what you do with respect to the substantive violation. It obviously doesn't arise if the harmlessness determination is perfectly fine. Well, suppose -- I mean, that's a very broad kind of rationale. It would apply even if the State court said that there was a violation; right? Then you would -- there's a violation, but no worries, it's harmless. And then you decide that the harmlessness issue is -- is out because that's an unreasonable application. And then you're going to have a reviewing court say, notwithstanding, that the State court found that there was a violation, we think that there's a credible argument that there wasn't such that we can support the judgment. Is that what you're asking? It's a little bit counterintuitive. I mean, would that -- would that also apply -- I'm just sort of trying to figure out the reach of this claim. Just take a case where there was no harmlessness determination. There was just a single decision about a Batson claim, but it was an egregious decision. It was, Hispanics aren't entitled to make Batson claims, something like that, egregiously wrong. But I guess under your theory, we just look to the judgment and then we decide, there is a credible way in which to say that this Batson claim was not a good one and that we should defer to that; is that right? ",ms urbanski let us say that they that the ninth circuit be wrong in that respect let us say that there be an adjudication on the merit here all right but i think that that do not solve the basic problem of this case there be an adjudication on the merit but there be these two prong there be the harmlessness prong and then there be the substantive violation prong whether a batson violation occur and what the court here say be if a batson violation occur it do not matter it would be harmless so if you for whatever reason right or wrong if you take that harmlessness determination out of the picture if you say that that be an unreasonable application of law all right we be leave with essentially a vacuum right and so what happen what do the court do where there be be no find as to a bat batson violation and you be say that it should kind of make up a reason why there might not have be a batson violation and and go with that and why be that the proper approach well you only do if the harmlessness determination be an unreasonable application under aedpa so if that be an unreasonable application you face the quandary of what you do with respect to the substantive violation it obviously do not arise if the harmlessness determination be perfectly fine well suppose i mean that be a very broad kind of rationale it would apply even if the state court say that there be a violation right then you would there be a violation but no worry it be harmless and then you decide that the harmlessness issue be be out because that be an unreasonable application and then you be go to have a reviewing court say notwithstanding that the state court find that there be a violation we think that there be a credible argument that there be not such that we can support the judgment be that what you be ask it be a little bit counterintuitive i mean would that would that also apply I be just sort of try to figure out the reach of this claim just take a case where there be no harmlessness determination there be just a single decision about a batson claim but it be an egregious decision it be hispanic be not entitle to make batson claim something like that egregiously wrong but i guess under your theory we just look to the judgment and then we decide there be a credible way in which to say that this batson claim be not a good one and that we should defer to that be that right ,157.51999999999995,Roberts Court,"Mar 3, 2015","Ron Davis, Acting Warden",Hector Ayala,13-1428,"Oct 20, 2014","Jun 18, 2015",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

But are you saying that there is no practical difference between the two? But if I could understand, Mr. Goldstein, what you're saying. Do you think that a judge properly considers the exact same factors whether it's done as the Respondents would like under Rule 54, or instead, whether it's done your way by staying the action or by holding off on a final order? Well, you know, maybe they're wrong. Yes, maybe they are wrong, Mr. Waxman, because I mean, they're -- they're obviously looking for a certain kind of flexibility, which is important, and which I take it both sides have agreed is important.

2014,"Young v. United Parcel Service, Inc.",114,Elena Kagan,"But why then I -- guess I'm not quite understanding why you pin get the source classifications into a different category from all other classifications. So explain that to me. Well, Ms. Halligan, could we talk about the claim that she did bring? So your reading of the statute basically makes everything after the semicolon completely superfluous. And I think you would agree with that, wouldn't you? But that is what the first provision does. When it says pregnancy is the same as sex, when we say because of sex, we also say because of pregnancy, all of that would be taken care of by that clause. So -- so you are saying it's not doing anything new; it's only explaining the old stuff. And okay. Tell me why that's necessary? I think, again, that that is not necessary, because all that the inquiry would be is were you discriminated against because you were pregnant? Yes, I was. No, I wasn't. You don't need any of this other stuff about what the comparator class is. And, in fact, you are creating a kind of double redundancy. It's everything past the semicolon is redundant, but then, moreover, the key words here, which is ""other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work. "" that becomes redundant even within the redundancy. That seems the -- that is the question that this language raises, right? Which is why source? But why not a seniority limitation or something like that? Could I give you an alternative way to understand what the statute is doing? Which is -- what we ought to be thinking about is McDonnell Douglas. In other words, this -- this provides the comparator. It says an employee can find a class of people who are being given an accommodation notwithstanding that those people are similarly situated with respect to work. An employee points to that class. And then in a typical McDonnell Douglas fashion, the employer comes back and says: No, there is a good reason why I'm treating that class differently that has nothing to do with pregnancy. It has something to do with I always treat more senior employees differently or something like that. And at that point, if the if the employer makes his case, the employee gets to come back and say, no, that is a pretext, in just the way we do with every other discrimination case. And that's what this is all about. It's identifying the comparator that the employee has to identify in the first instance in order to shift the burden to the government to come back with a reason. Ms. Halligan, what is wrong with my middle ground? It's not that Mr. Bagenstos and the General's ground, because it allows the employer to come back and say: I have a legitimate policy based on seniority, or even I have a legitimate policy based on the source of the injury. But it does put that as a question whenever an employee is able to point to a similar -- to a class of people who are granted the disability accommodation who aren't pregnant. Quite the opposite. It basically gives a function for what -- the key words of the statute are ""other persons not so affected but similar in their ability and inability to work. "" What is that doing? What it does is it points to the comparator that sets off the McDonnell Douglas test, that forces the employer to come back and give a reason for why it is that this ought not to be taken as discrimination against pregnancy. Well, Ms. Halligan, suppose this-- --Suppose this, and it's exactly what Justice Breyer is talking about. Suppose you had a policy that said we're going to provide accommodations to -- for anybody with a -- a nonoccupational sickness and and accident. Very similar to Gilbert-- --but without all the other facts of Gilbert. We're just -- it's a facial policy. We're going to provide accommodations, but, of course, pregnancy is not a nonoccupational sickness and accident, so as a result of this facially neutral policy, pregnant women will not get accommodations. Now, as I understand what you are saying, it's -- that's perfectly fine. Yes, this is nonoccupational sickness and accident. But that's where we disagree because -- because what this tells you is it tells you what the comparators are. The comparators are any class you can come up with who is -- is -- has the same disability and isn't pregnant, and then the employer can come back and say, no, we had a good reason to -- to treat that class of employees differently. And if you -- if you buy that with respect to the Gilbert distinction, I don't understand why you wouldn't buy it with respect to any other classification. But we absolutely know that what Gilbert -- was said was that kind of policy was legitimate and that Congress came back and said, no, that kind of policy is illegitimate, right? But as I understand the answer to my question, and tell me if I'm wrong, is you're saying with respect to a facially neutral policy as to nonoccupational sickness and health-- --that you think that -- that is illegal under the PDA. I'm sorry-- --Even if it's -- it's exactly the policy that's in Gilbert, and you're saying that's fine? It didn't. There were lots of other things except for pregnancy that got excluded in Gilbert. If -- if a man had a vasectomy, it got excluded in Gilbert. If somebody got into a bar fight, it got excluded under the policy in Gilbert. If a person had cosmetic surgery, it got excluded under the policy in Gilbert. Gilbert was about much more than singling out. Well, Ms. Halligan, for the democratic process to work as it should, the PDA has to be given a fair reading. And what we know about the PDA is that it was supposed to be about removing stereotypes of pregnant women as marginal workers. It was supposed to be about ensuring that they wouldn't be unfairly excluded from the workplace. And what you are saying is that there's a policy that accommodates some workers, but puts all pregnant women on one side of the line. And what you are further saying is that the employer doesn't even have to justify that policy ala McDonnell Douglas. That seems to me a reading of the statute, the PDA, that ignores two-thirds of the text. ",but why then i guess I be not quite understanding why you pin get the source classification into a different category from all other classification so explain that to me well ms halligan could we talk about the claim that she do bring so your reading of the statute basically make everything after the semicolon completely superfluous and i think you would agree with that would not you but that

2014,"Reed et al. v. Town of Gilbert, Arizona et al.",114,Elena Kagan,"Can I ask about the category for political signs, which is the most favorable? Because all the time this Court says that political speech is the most valued kind of speech. It's at the heart of the First Amendment. It gets special First Amendment protection. So in a way, why aren't -- isn't -- isn't the locality here basically adopting the same kind of category-based understanding of political speech and its special rule and First Amendment analysis that this Court has very frequently articulated? Mr. Savrin, could I ask what the -- your justification is for these specially generous provisions on ideological signs? I mean, putting aside the level of scrutiny, why do you have these very generous rules for ideological signs as compared to others? So you are not even purporting to have a content -- neutral justification for this. You are essentially saying, yes, we generally dislike clutter, but we're willing to make exceptions for clutter for speech that we think has special First Amendment significance. Just, again, if I could understand-- --let's even assume that intermediate scrutiny applies, and just focus in on this special provision for ideological speech which allows very large signs to stay up as long as possible. And you would say we're making that exception, if you will, to the general rule that there shouldn't be clutter and there shouldn't be a lot of these signs because, why? No, no, no. I just asked you for the exemption for ideological signs, for the specially generous provision for ideological signs. Why do ideological signs get such generous treatment? Okay. So that is a content-based rationale. And, you know, on one theory, you lose regardless of what the standard of review is. You are not justifying it on the grounds of safety or on the grounds of clutter. You're saying, this is a special kind of speech that we think there ought to be more of. Yeah. So that goes back to what Justice Scalia said. It's viewpoint neutral, but, you know, it's content-based. And maybe you are just saying that we've run amok on this content-based distinction, and there would be an argument there. But, I mean, it is content-based to say what is ideology and what is not. ",can i ask about the category for political sign which be the most favorable because all the time this court say that political speech be the most valued kind of speech it be at the heart of the first amendment it get special first amendment protection so in a way why be not be not be not the locality here basically adopt the same kind of category base understanding of political speech and its special rule and first amendment analysis that this court have very frequently articulate mr savrin could i ask what the your justification be for these specially generous provision on ideological sign i mean put aside the level of scrutiny why do you have these very generous rule for ideological sign as compare to others so you be not even purport to have a content neutral justification for this you be essentially say yes we generally dislike clutter but we be willing to make exception for clutter for speech that we think have special first amendment significance just again if i could understand let us even assume that intermediate scrutiny applies and just focus in on this special provision for ideological speech which allow very large sign to stay up as long as possible and you would say we be make that exception if you will to the general rule that there should not be clutter and there should not be a lot of these sign because why no no no i just ask you for the exemption for ideological sign for the specially generous provision for ideological sign why do ideological sign get such generous treatment okay so that be a content base rationale and you know on one theory you lose regardless of what the standard of review be you be not justify it on the ground of safety or on the ground of clutter you be say this be a special kind of speech that we think there ought to be more of yeah so that go back to what justice scalia say it be viewpoint neutral but you know it be content base and maybe you be just say that we have run amok on this content base distinction and there would be an argument there but i mean it be content base to say what be ideology and what be not ,146.58999999999997,Roberts Court,"Jan 12, 2015","Clyde Reed, et al.","Town of Gilbert, Arizona, et al.",13-502,"Jul 1, 2014","Jun 18, 2015",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2014,"Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Center, Inc.",114,Elena Kagan,"Yes, but what if they just asked the -- the patient herself to -- to pay a supplemental rate? And then you would have come in and you would say, you know, you can't do that. Yes, it's not allowed. That's right. But that's why you would bring an enforcement action against such a supplemental bill. That would be a merits question. I mean, they would make that exact claim. They would say, the rates are too low; the rates violate Federal law; we're entitled to a higher rate. Well, did it go, Mr. Withroe -- and this is true of some significant parts of your brief, you might have an argument on the merits that there shouldn't be preemption here, that the nature of 30(A) is that the Federal law doesn't preempt the State law. But that's an argument on the merits; it's not a question about whether somebody can come into court and make that claim and tee it up for a court to decide whether there's been preemption in the case. We're not absent the Medicaid program. The -- the Medicaid program is just like any other statute which provides certain people with certain entitlements or abilities or benefits or something else. And the question here is whether a benefit that the Medicaid program has provided and whether a requirement that the Medicaid program has imposed on the State is being flouted, and that's the question, just like it is in any other question not arising under the Spending Clause. Judging from the -- the names on the brief, I take it that HHS does not agree with that statement. Judging from the names on your brief-- --or the absence of names on your brief, I take it that HHS does not agree with that statement. I mean-- That's -- that's your whole claim, right, is that they didn't -- the State didn't apply the methodology that the State developed and that CMS approved. So CMS is completely consistent with your position. The only-- --thing that is inconsistent with your position -- and the Department, for that matter, is consistent with your decision. The only thing that's inconsistent with your decision is the State's willingness to go ahead with the methodology that its own department devised and that HHS, CMS approved. It seems to me if I understand your claim, it's that CMS has already spoken. All you're asking is for the State to come into compliance with what CMS said, that's it. So they're not going to send it back for you. They've already spoken. You're just asking the State to come into compliance with what HHS has said. No, you think-- --Could I-- --Mr. Piotrowski, could I go back to Justice Breyer's question and just if you will tell me if you agree with this. In the -- in the mine run of cases, CMS will have approved something. It will have approved a methodology and/or a set of rates. And -- and somebody's going to come in and challenge that and -- and they're going to lose, right? Because the Court is just going to say, we give deference to CMS and CMS has approved what the State has done -- is doing, end of case, correct? So that leaves I think two kinds of cases. And it's exactly the kinds of cases that we've seen in Douglas and in this case. In Douglas the State just flouts CMS. It says we're going to go ahead and do what we want without seeking their permission. States usually don't do that, but that's what they did there and that gave rise to a claim which was not so easy to dismiss. And then in the second kind of case, the State goes to CMS, says: ""This is what we'd like to do. "" CMS says: ""You're right, this is a great thing to do. "" And then the State just doesn't do it. All right. So it's these two very cabined circumstances: One where the State flouts CMS; and the other where the State asks CMS, gets its approval and then decides, we're not doing it. Those are not the mine run of cases. The mine run of cases are going to be extremely easy, I would think, under standard principles of deference, to deal with. Sorry, Mr. Withroe, but I just -- when you say that, I mean, my understanding of the district court's opinion was that it was specifically -- it wasn't sort of doing this on its own in deciding what would be efficient by its lights. What it was entirely based on was the State's own cost studies and it was just saying that the State had already decided this and because the State had already decided that this was necessary in order to meet the standard, that the State had to comply with its own views. ",yes but what if they just ask the the patient herself to to pay a supplemental rate and then you would have come in and you would say you know you can not do that yes it be not allow that be right but that be why you would bring an enforcement action against such a supplemental bill that would be a merits question i mean they would make that exact claim they would say the rate be too low the rate violate federal law we be entitle to a high rate well do it go mr withroe and this be true of some significant part of your brief you might have an argument on the merit that there should not be preemption here that the nature of a be that the federal law do not preempt the state law but that be an argument on the merit it be not a question about whether somebody can come into court and make that claim and tee it up for a court to decide whether there be be preemption in the case we be not absent the medicaid program the the medicaid program be just like any other statute which provide certain people with certain entitlement or ability or benefit or something else and the question here be whether a benefit that the medicaid program have provide and whether a requirement that the medicaid program have impose on the state be be flout and that be the question just like it be in any other question not arise under the spending clause judge from the the name on the brief i take it that hhs do not agree with that statement judge from the name on your brief or the absence of name on your brief i take it that hhs do not agree with that statement i mean that be that be your whole claim right be that they do not the state do not apply the methodology that the state develop and that cm approve so cms be completely consistent with your position the only thing that be inconsistent with your position and the department for that matter be consistent with your decision the only thing that be inconsistent with your decision be the state s willingness to go ahead with the methodology that its own department devise and that hhs cm approve it seem to me if i understand your claim it be that cm have already speak all you be ask be for the state to come into compliance with what cm say that be it so they be not go to send it back for you they have already speak you be just ask the state to come into compliance with what hhs have say no you think could i mr piotrowski could i go back to justice breyer s question and just if you will tell me if you agree with this in the in the mine run of case cm will have approve something it will have approve a methodology andor a set of rate and and somebody s go to come in and challenge that and and they be go to lose right because the court be just go to say we give deference to cms and cms have approve what the state have do be do end of case correct so that leave i think two kind of case and it be exactly the kind of case that we have see in douglas and in this case in douglas the state just flouts cm it say we be go to go ahead and do what we want without seek their permission state usually do not do that but that be what they do there and that give rise to a claim which be not so easy to dismiss and then in the second kind of case the state go to cms say this be what we would like to do cm say you be right this be a great thing to do and then the state just do not do it all right so it be these two very cabined circumstance one where the state flouts cm and the other where the state ask cm get its approval and then decides we be not do it those be not the mine run of case the mine run of case be go to be extremely easy i would think under standard principle of deference to deal with sorry mr withroe but i just when you say that i mean my understanding of the district court s opinion be that it be specifically it be not sort of do this on its own in decide what would be efficient by its light what it be entirely base on be the state s own cost study and it be just say that the state have already decide this and because the state have already decide that this be necessary in order to meet the standard that the state have to comply with its own view ,266.11,Roberts Court,"Jan 20, 2015","Richard Armstrong, et al.","Exceptional Child Center, Inc., et al.",14-15,"Oct 2, 2014","Mar 31, 2015",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2014,Henderson v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"But it's not just return; right? It's return the property to the movant. So how does this fit under 41(g)? Just so I understand the scope of your position, you say that the district court has discretion to figure out, you know, whether a particular person whom your client or someone else wants to sell the gun to is an appropriate recipient of the gun. But in the absence of that, does the district court just have discretion or must the district court ensure that the gun is sold through a gun dealer? In other words, if -- if your client says really I want it sold through a gun dealer, is that discretionary on the district court's part or is that required? And, Mr. -- And, Mr. Ortiz, why is it required that the court arrange for some transfer, whether to a gun dealer or otherwise? Is it principles of equity that require that? Is it something else? Right. There -- there's no statutory bar, but I guess I'm asking a further question because you said in response to my earlier question it's not just discretionary, it's required, you know, at least to a gun dealer. And -- and I guess I'm asking: What is the source of that requirement? But do you think that the -- the person can pick the firearms dealer? Well, then your -- your position is internally contradictory, right? You think he can pick the firearms dealer. Well, that's -- that fits within your very broad definition of control. Well, then suppose his friend comes forward and says, I don't really intend to possess this. I'm going to sell it. That wouldn't be control? Well, lucky you. (Laughter.) Ms. O'Connell, can I ask why -- why it is that we're looking at it in terms of the sale? I mean, this is -- this constructive possession question, it would seem to me to make a lot more sense to ask the person who's going to end up getting it, is there a chance that the original owner can control what that person does with it. In other words, you know, I give it to my wife, I give it to my best friend, and I'm really in a position where I'm controlling the use of the firearm. And that seems to me to make perfect sense, not the question of, like, who controls the sale mechanism. But that seems to me very different than the situation here, Ms. O'Connell, because in that case, what the gang leader has is a situation where somebody else is holding a gun for him and he can say anything to that person. He can say, Use the gun. He can say, Keep the gun in your closet. He can say, Sell it to Person A or Person B or Person C. He has total freedom over it. And that's very different from the situation here where the only thing that a person would -- a person in Mr. Henderson's position can do is to sell the gun to a person whom the court approves. Ms. O'Connell, I think it's implicit in what you're saying, but I just wanted to make it clear. Although you say that Rule 41(g) is not the appropriate mechanism, you have no doubt that courts do have the equitable authority to do this. Is that correct? ",but it be not just return right it be return the property to the movant so how do this fit under g just so i understand the scope of your position you say that the district court have discretion to figure out you know whether a particular person whom your client or someone else want to sell the gun to be an appropriate recipient of the gun but in the absence of that do the district court just have discretion or must the district court ensure that the gun be sell through a gun dealer in other word if if your client say really i want it sell through a gun dealer be that discretionary on the district court s part or be that required and mr and mr ortiz why be it require that the court arrange for some transfer whether to a gun dealer or otherwise be it principles of equity that require that be it something else right there there be no statutory bar but i guess I be ask a further question because you say in response to my early question it be not just discretionary it be require you know at least to a gun dealer and and i guess I be ask what be the source of that requirement but do you think that the the person can pick the firearm dealer well then your your position be internally contradictory right you think he can pick the firearm dealer well that be that fit within your very broad definition of control well then suppose his friend come forward and say i do not really intend to possess this I be go to sell it that would not be control well lucky you laughter ms oconnell can i ask why why it be that we be look at it in term of the sale i mean this be this constructive possession question it would seem to me to make a lot more sense to ask the person who be go to end up get it be there a chance that the original owner can control what that person do with it in other word you know i give it to my wife i give it to my best friend and I be really in a position where I be control the use of the firearm and that seem to me to make perfect sense not the question of like who control the sale mechanism but that seem to me very different than the situation here ms oconnell because in that case what the gang leader have be a situation where somebody else be hold a gun for him and he can say anything to that person he can say use the gun he can say keep the gun in your closet he can say sell it to person a or person b or person c he have total freedom over it and that be very different from the situation here where the only thing that a person would a person in mr henderson s position can do be to sell the gun to a person whom the court approve ms oconnell i think it be implicit in what you be say but i just want to make it clear although you say that rule g be not the appropriate mechanism you have no doubt that court do have the equitable authority to do this be that correct ,175.12,Roberts Court,"Feb 24, 2015",Tony Henderson,United States,13-1487,"Oct 20, 2014","May 18, 2015",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2014,Kingsley v. Hendrickson,114,Elena Kagan,"But -- but Ms. Ward, you've said a few times that we're supposed to be looking to see whether something counts as punishment. And in the Eighth Amendment context, we've suggested that that term ""punishment"" does indeed have a subjective component; that it requires some kind of intent to chastise or to deter. So I'm a little bit with Justice Kennedy, that I'm not quite sure what the word ""punishment"" is doing in this context, but if we're looking for punishment, we have indicated that punishment is a subjective concept. Mr. Clement, sorry. There's a lot to what you say that sometimes the practical concerns are the same for pretrial detainees and for convicted criminals. There's also something to the other point of view, which is that in our cases, we've consistently said that if you're a pretrial detainee, if you haven't been found to have committed wrongful conduct, you shouldn't be treated the same way as people who have been found to have committed wrongful conduct; that for the convicted criminals, it's kind of, you know, we're allowed to punish them, because they've done something wrong. And we haven't found that yet for the pretrial detainees. And so what place in your system is there for that, you know, very commonsensical, and also, you know, normatively attractive proposition that people who haven't been found to have done anything ought not to be treated with the same level of disregard for their interests as people who have been? So that might be, but let's take another comparison. And the comparison is two people who have been indicted for the same offense, and one makes bail and he's out on the street, and the other doesn't make bail, and so he is in an institutional facility. And the one who's out on the street has some kind of encounter with a police officer, and he reaches into his pocket to take out something, and the police officer shoots him. And let's just imagine that circumstances are such that this is utterly unreasonable. And then the same -- the same person indicted for the same offense, not convicted of that offense, same circumstances, the police shoot him, now he's not going to be treated in any respect the same way. Why should that be so? Mr. Clement, why not look at it this way? I mean, you said -- and it's really the basis of your argument -- that being in an institutional setting is the game-changer. There's no doubt it's important. But there's another potential game-changer as well, and that is this question of have you actually been convicted? Has the legal system found that you're a person who is a wrongdoer? So if we say that both of these things are important, why shouldn't we adopt a set of principles that say it is -- we're -- we're looking for objectively reasonable conduct, but in looking for that, of course we take into account the prison circumstances. Of course we take into account the context in making that evaluation, so that the person on the street does not necessarily come up with the same result as the person in prison because the contexts are different. But still, the test, the basic test is the same because they are both people who have not been found to have done anything wrong. I would think that the jury would give a lot of deference to prison officials, in part because they are unfamiliar with the circumstances. And folks will come in and will say, you know, here's -- I think that there's -- that -- that that will be the natural tendency. But if you really -- -- if you really -- -- want to take the Judge Friendly test -- and I guess you've talked about this before, but it is a multifactor test where the question of sadisticness is counting as a plus factor, a thumb on the scales. But it's clear under that test that even if that sadistic quality isn't there, it's still allowable to hold the prison official to have violated the law. ",but but ms ward you have say a few time that we be suppose to be look to see whether something count as punishment and in the eighth amendment context we have suggest that that term punishment do indeed have a subjective component that it require some kind of intent to chastise or to deter so I be a little bit with justice kennedy that I be not quite sure what the word punishment be do in this context but if we be look for punishment we have indicate that punishment be a subjective concept mr clement sorry there be a lot to what you say that sometimes the practical concern be the same for pretrial detainee and for convict criminal there be also something to the other point of view which be that in our case we have consistently say that if you be a pretrial detainee if you have not be find to have commit wrongful conduct you should not be treat the same way as people who have be find to have commit wrongful conduct that for the convict criminal it be kind of you know we be allow to punish them because they have do something wrong and we have not find that yet for the pretrial detainee and so what place in your system be there for that you know very commonsensical and also you know normatively attractive proposition that people who have not be find to have do anything ought not to be treat with the same level of disregard for their interest as people who have be so that might be but let us take another comparison and the comparison be two people who have be indict for the same offense and one make bail and he be out on the street and the other do not make bail and so he be in an institutional facility and the one who be out on the street have some kind of encounter with a police officer and he reach into his pocket to take out something and the police officer shoot him and let us just imagine that circumstance be such that this be utterly unreasonable and then the same the same person indict for the same offense not convict of that offense same circumstance the police shoot him now he be not go to be treat in any respect the same way why should that be so mr clement why not look at it this way i mean you say and it be really the basis of your argument that be in an institutional setting be the game changer there be no doubt it be important but there be another potential game changer as well and that be this question of have you actually be convict have the legal system find that you be a person who be a wrongdoer so if we say that both of these thing be important why should not we adopt a set of principle that say it be we be we be look for objectively reasonable conduct but in look for that of course we take into account the prison circumstance of course we take into account the context in make that evaluation so that the person on the street do not necessarily come up with the same result as the person in prison because the context be different but still the test the basic test be the same because they be both people who have not be find to have do anything wrong i would think that the jury would give a lot of deference to prison official in part because they be unfamiliar with the circumstance and folk will come in and will say you know here s i think that there be that that that will be the natural tendency but if you really if you really want to take the judge friendly test and i guess you have talk about this before but it be a multifactor test where the question of sadisticness be count as a plus factor a thumb on the scale but it be clear under that test that even if that sadistic quality be not there it be still allowable to hold the prison official to have violate the law ,239.19,Roberts Court,"Apr 27, 2015",Michael B.

When would there be implied consent? On the basis of what? You've -- you've said, I think, that the consent has to be knowing and intelligent. Is there something that has to be told to the debtor to make the consent knowing and intelligent? You were saying that you wanted to talk about the importance of both questions. I think you got the first one out. What, in your view, is the importance of the second? Well, but it's something which has to be enforced by a court except in very extraordinary circumstances. You know, there's much less supervision over the arbitration system than there is over a typical bankruptcy court. All those things make it worse. You know, this is a proceeding that's totally divorced from any kind of control by anybody, and yet Federal courts, under the Arbitration Act, simply have to rubber-stamp it and say it's valid except in extremely unusual circumstances. This is the parties' contract. It's -- I mean, the entire question is that the parties are consenting to go to bankruptcy court, and the question is: Will that consent be sufficient in the same way that it is in the arbitration system? Well, I understand that Alderson-- --Please. I'm sorry. I -- you know, I understand that formalism matters in many contexts, but the fact that the arbitrator himself doesn't issue the judgment, and instead you have to take it across the street and the Federal court has to issue the judgment, basically on the arbitrator's say-so, again, seems to me -- I mean, the arbitrator case seems to me much more threatening to the integrity of the Federal judicial system than a system of bankruptcy courts which are, from the very beginning all the way through, supervised by -- by district courts.

2014,Heien v. North Carolina,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. -- Mr. Fisher, suppose this were a Federal case and we had available to us, it had all been briefed, two alternative holdings in order to support the conviction. And one holding was this is not a violation of Fourth Amendment law in the first instance, and the other holding was this is a violation of Fourth Amendment law, but the exclusionary rule operates and so the -- the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule operates and so the evidence comes in. Is there any difference between those two holdings? No, no, no. But I mean, if it were a Federal case-- --Is there any difference? Yes, please. Well, you say that, but some people say that the existence of a rule-remedy gap undermines public confidence in the law. So why should we take that argument any more seriously than the -- than the rule-remedy gap problem in law? No, I think it doesn't protect the-- --Yes. So I think what the Chief Justice is asking you is to describe a case for us where the officer would receive qualified immunity but it would not count as reasonable for these purposes. Mr. Montgomery, I take it that one of Mr. Fisher's arguments, maybe his primary argument, is that this just looks like a remedies question, it does not look like a rights question, it focuses on the culpability of the officer in the way we do when we think about immunity or when we think about the exclusionary rule. So why isn't that exactly right, that to the extent that this conviction ought to be upheld, it ought to be upheld on remedies reasons rather than rights reasons to fit in with our basic understanding of what remedies and rights do and do differently in our law? Well, do you think if DeFillippo came up again today, with all the cases that have been decided since then, that we would decide it the same way or do you think we would conceptualize it now as a remedies question? Isn't there another difference between DeFillippo and this case? The court in DeFillippo talks a lot about how there's a presumption of constitutionality for any statute and we don't want officers to go around questioning the constitutionality of statutes. But here, that's not the case. Here, there's a statute and an officer is not supposed to read it as broadly as possible. An officer is supposed to read it fairly. So there's no presumption that goes into effect and there's no -- there's no way in which we could say the same thing about DeFillippo, is that we don't want officers to question -- to inquire into this area. We want them to enforce the law fairly and as written and -- and not to push every statute to its -- you know, to the furthest, furthest, furthest it could go without being found, you know, utterly unreasonable. Ms. Kovner, you started your argument by saying you were going to give us three reasons why this should be a rights question rather than a remedies question. You said history, which frankly, you know, I think your history probably doesn't say as much as you think it says. So I want to know what is number two and number three are.

2014,"Walker v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans, Inc.",114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Keller -- And does that have any limits, Mr. Keller? I mean, suppose somebody submitted a license plate to Texas that said, ""Vote Republican,"" and -- and Texas said, yes, that's fine. And then the next person submitted a license plate to Texas and it said, ""Vote Democratic,"" and Texas said, no, we're not going to approve that one. What about that? But why -- why wouldn't it allow that? Well, this is not an Establishment Clause issue. So I'm -- I'm curious as to why -- what -- what constitutional constraints you think there are and how they would play out as to the kind of hypothetical I just gave you. How many have you disapproved other than this one? And in -- in -- which -- what other ones have you disapproved? All on the ground of offense? And could -- could I ask, Mr. Keller, if you go down to Texas and you just stare at license plates, are most of them just the standard license plate and then these 400 license plates you see very carefully, or do most people actually have one of these specialty plates? But there's a very -- there's a substantial percentage that are not? There -- it's not by any means unusual to see a specialty plate? But in a world in which you have approved 400 license plates and they are pretty common in the State of Texas and you have only disapproved a very select few, you know, it does seem as though you've basically given -- relinquished your control over this and, you know, made it a people's license plate for whatever private speech people want to -- to say. But Mr. Keller, one of the -- one of the concerns that that raises, and this really goes back to what Justice Kennedy said, is that outside the traditional area of streets and parks, this is a new world. There are all kinds of new expressive forums being created every day and as those come into play, as long as the State says, hey, look, we're going to regulate everything for offense, we're going to keep anything offensive out of this expressive forum. It does create the possibility that in this new world with all these new kinds of expressive fora, the State will have a much greater control over its citizens' speech than we've typically been comfortable with. Well, of course, Mr. George. If you had a standard like that in a case, in a normal case where we were regulating private speech, of course, we would find that impermissible. But the question is whether this is a very different kind of context. And let's go back to -- I think Justice Scalia said it, about the nature of license plates. I mean, I think there is a clear regulatory purpose here. It's the government that actually makes the license plate. I think the license plate continues to be public property, if that's right, like you have to return the license plate. It has the State's name on it. It's clearly the official identification that the State gives with respect to a car. So why doesn't all of that make -- make this a very different case from the typical forum cases that -- that we usually address? What happens if private people could submit messages, but they all had to go through the legislature? Well, what's the difference, then? I mean, if you say -- if you think that that would be all right, you know, Texas has said, well, the DMV does it, not the legislature, a different branch of government, but it's government just the same. Mr. George, could I just take you back to the Chief Justice's question for a moment and just make sure I understand it. Mr. Keller has indicated that there are a number of other occasions in which the State has disapproved plates, and in which the State has done that on the grounds of offense. Do you -- do you have any objections to those representations? No, but Mr. George, just the worst of the worst, whether it's the swastika or whether it's the most offensive racial epithet that you can imagine, and if that were on a license plate where it really is provoking violence of some kind. You know, somebody is going to ram into that car -- ",mr keller and do that have any limit mr keller i mean suppose somebody submit a license plate to texas that say vote republican and and texas say yes that be fine and then the next person submit a license plate to texas and it say vote democratic and texas say no we be not go to approve that one what about that but why why would not it allow that well this be not an establishment clause issue so I be I be curious as to why what what constitutional constraint you think there be and how they would play out as to the kind of hypothetical i just give you how many have you disapprove other than this one and in in which what other one have you disapprove all on the ground of offense and could could i ask mr keller if you go down to texas and you just stare at license plate be most of them just the standard license plate and then these license plate you see very carefully or do most people actually have one of these specialty plate but there be a very there be a substantial percentage that be not there it be not by any mean unusual to see a specialty plate but in a world in which you have approve license plate and they be pretty common in the state of texas and you have only disapprove a very select few you know it do seem as though you have basically give relinquish your control over this and you know make it a people s license plate for whatever private speech people want to to say but mr keller one of the one of the concern that that raise and this really go back to what justice kennedy say be that outside the traditional area of street and park this be a new world there be all kind of new expressive forum be create every day and as those come into play as long as the state say hey look we be go to regulate everything for offense we be go to keep anything offensive out of this expressive forum it do create the possibility that in this new world with all these new kind of expressive forum the state will have a much great control over its citizen speech than we have typically be comfortable with well of course mr george if you have a standard like that in a case in a normal case where we we be regulate private speech of course we would find that impermissible but the question be whether this be a very different kind of context and let us go back to i think justice scalia say it about the nature of license plate i mean i think there be a clear regulatory purpose here it be the government that actually make the license plate i think the license plate continue to be public property if that be right like you have to return the license plate it have the state s name on it it be clearly the official identification that the state give with respect to a car so why do not all of that make make this a very different case from the typical forum case that that we usually address what happen if private people could submit message but they all have to go through the legislature well what be the difference then i mean if you say if you think that that would be all right you know texas have say well the dmv do it not the legislature a different branch of government but it be government just the same mr george could i just take you back to the chief justice s question for a moment and just make sure i understand it mr keller have indicate that there be a number of other occasion in which the state have disapprove plate and in which the state have do that on the ground of offense do you do you have any objection to those representation no but mr george just the bad of the bad whether it be the swastika or whether it be the most offensive racial epithet that you can imagine and if that we be on a license plate where it really be provoke violence of some kind you know somebody be go to ram into that car ,242.78,Roberts Court,"Mar 23, 2015","John Walker, III, et al.","Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans, Inc., et al.",14-144,"Dec 5, 2014","Jun 18, 2015",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2014,Elonis v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"Could I-- --Mr. Elwood, sort of along the same lines, and getting back to what the Chief Justice asked you, because I was a little bit surprised by your answer: I'm trying to figure out what exactly the level of intent you want is. So one, the very, very highest level might be I affirmatively want to place this person in fear; that's why I'm doing what I'm doing. All right? There's a step down from that which is: I don't want to do that; I'm just fulfilling my artistic fantasies, whatever you want to call it; but I know that I am going to place this person in fear. Is that -- what which intent do you want? The second. How about you just take it a step down more but not get to the government's. How about if you don't know to a certainty, but you know that there is a substantial probability that you will place that person in fear, which is what I take it we would usually mean when we talk about recklessness? Well, what would be wrong with a recklessness standard? Why is that too low? It seems that a recklessness standard has a kind of buffer zone around it. You know, it gets you up one level from what the government wants, so what -- who is the person that we should be worried is going to be convicted under a recklessness standard? Mr. Elwood, when we have looked at fighting words statutes, we've never applied this kind of heightened intent. As I understand fighting words prosecutions, that all the government has to show is that you've said something that would cause a reasonable person to punch you in the face. And that's all we ask. So why shouldn't this be basically the same as that? Well, how would using that exact standard -- and it's pretty similar to the standard that Justice Breyer had because the way Justice Breyer had it, it's knowledge that a reasonable person would cause fear. And you could say -- it's basically the same thing to say -- to say, you know, substantial probability that the person you're talking to would feel fear. So either way, you know, there is a little bit of a fudge factor as to -- but the critical point is that you have to know something about the probability that you're going to cause fear in another person. And if you really don't know that thing, then you're not liable. What would be wrong with that? Mr. Dreeben, you are asking us to go down -- you know, it's not purpose, it's not knowledge of causing fear, it's not a conscious disregard of causing fear, it's just that you should have known that you were going to cause fear, essentially. And that's not the kind of standard that we typically use in the First Amendment. The only time I can think of is in the fighting words context, because we typically say that the First Amendment requires a kind of a buffer zone to ensure that even stuff that is wrongful maybe is permitted because we don't want to chill innocent behavior. So I guess the question is shouldn't we allow some kind of buffer zone here past the sort of reasonable-man negligence standard that you are proposing. But, Mr. Dreeben, couldn't you say that about a lot of criminal law, that the harm is the conduct, irrespective of what was in the person's head, and yet we insist on looking very often at what was in the person's head? ",could i mr elwood sort of along the same line and get back to what the chief justice ask you because i be a little bit surprised by your answer I be try to figure out what exactly the level of intent you want be so one the very very high level might be i affirmatively want to place this person in fear that be why I be do what I be do all right there be a step down from that which be i do not want to do that I be just fulfil my artistic fantasy whatever you want to call it but i know that i be go to place this person in fear be that what which intent do you want the second how about you just take it a step down more but not get to the government s how about if you do not know to a certainty but you know that there be a substantial probability that you will place that person in fear which be what i take it we would usually mean when we talk about recklessness well what would be wrong with a recklessness standard why be that too low it seem that a recklessness standard have a kind of buffer zone around it you know it get you up one level from what the government want so what who be the person that we should be worry be go to be convict under a recklessness standard mr elwood when we have look at fight word statute we have never apply this kind of heightened intent as i understand fight word prosecution that all the government have to show be that you have say something that would because a reasonable person to punch you in the face and that be all we ask so why should not this be basically the same as that well how would use that exact standard and it be pretty similar to the standard that justice breyer have because the way justice breyer have it it be knowledge that a reasonable person would because fear and you could say it be basically the same thing to say to say you know substantial probability that the person you be talk to would feel fear so either way you know there be a little bit of a fudge factor as to but the critical point be that you have to know something about the probability that you be go to because fear in another person and if you really do not know that thing then you be not liable what would be wrong with that mr dreeben you be ask us to go down you know it be not purpose it be not knowledge of cause fear it be not a conscious disregard of cause fear it be just that you should have know that you we be go to because fear essentially and that be not the kind of standard that we typically use in the first amendment the only time i can think of be in the fighting word context because we typically say that the first amendment require a kind of a buffer zone to ensure that even stuff that be wrongful maybe be permit because we do not want to chill innocent behavior so i guess the question be should not we allow some kind of buffer zone here past the sort of reasonable man negligence standard that you be propose but mr dreeben could not you say that about a lot of criminal law that the harm be the conduct irrespective of what be in the person s head and yet we insist on look very often at what be in the person s head ,226.68000000000004,Roberts Court,"Dec 1, 2014",Anthony Elonis,United States,13-983,"Jun 16, 2014","Jun 1, 2015",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2014,Reyes Mata v. Lynch,114,Elena Kagan,"And Mr. Yang, could you point me to the place in the board's decision that you think makes clear what the board was doing? Because as I looked at the board's decision, honestly, I found it a little bit difficult to tell whether the board was denying it on statutory grounds or on sua sponte grounds. So on that assumption, that would, as I understand it, give the Fifth Circuit something new to think about in -- in addressing this question; is that right? I'm -- I'm sorry, but there would be an NPR when? Late this calendar year? Just to try to be a little bit generous to the Fifth Circuit, again, I mean, I started off by saying, I found it a little bit hard to tell what the agency was doing. And you presented a very good explanation, but it's an explanation that actually requires some background knowledge, and I'm not sure that they would have gotten that from just looking at the face of the thing. But, I mean, you can't really -- Chenery can't really operate very well if you can't figure it out. Do you deny that the plaintiff here -- that Petitioner thought that he was asking for equitable tolling? Because I guess -- I guess this is very similar to the Chief Justice's question, but it seems to me if somebody comes in and he says, I'm entitled to equitable tolling, and the court thinks, no, you're not, equitable tolling is unavailable. Then what the court should do is something like this. It should first say, sorry, equitable tolling is not available. Now, is there a different way we can construe your petition? Oh, maybe there is. We can construe it as a sua sponte decision. Now in the end that's going to lead you to the same results because we don't have jurisdiction over that, but that that's the proper order of things. You know, first we'll say, oop, sorry you lose equitable tolling is unavailable, and then we'll do whatever construing we can do to see if there are any alternative avenues, and then we decide there are not. No, but there's a -- there is something, and this is what the Chief Justice was saying, too. There is something that the court does have jurisdiction over and it's the question of whether equitable tolling was available. That's a merits question, I have jurisdiction over whether equitable tolling is available. I say it's not or I say it is; doesn't matter, I have jurisdiction over that question either way. It's not determining whether it has jurisdiction. That -- whether equitable tolling is available or is unavailable is -- is not itself a jurisdictional question. That's a merits question. And then when you decide that it's unavailable you can say, okay, is there another way to construe the thing, and that ends -- that lands you in a jurisdictional question as to whether you have jurisdiction over sua sponte decisions. But you see there's a little bit of a problem with the way the Fifth Circuit is going about this thing, because what the Fifth Circuit has done is to say that equitable tolling is unavailable and the only time it ever uttered those words is in an unpublished opinion. And in all the published opinions it's just said, you know, we're construing this as something else and we have no jurisdiction over that. And what that effectively has done is to insulate from our review the determination that the Fifth Circuit has made, if the Fifth Circuit has made it, that equitable tolling is unavailable. He's definitely Justice Scalia. (Laughter.) And we're not often confused. (Laughter.) ",and mr yang could you point me to the place in the board s decision that you think make clear what the board be do because as i look at the board s decision honestly i find it a little bit difficult to tell whether the board be deny it on statutory ground or on sua sponte ground so on that assumption that would as i understand it give the fifth circuit something new to think about in in address this question be that right I be I be sorry but there would be an npr when late this calendar year just to try to be a little bit generous to the fifth circuit again i mean i start off by say i find it a little bit hard to tell what the agency be do and you present a very good explanation but it be an explanation that actually require some background knowledge and I be not sure that they would have get that from just look at the face of the thing but i mean you can not really chenery can not really operate very well if you can not figure it out do you deny that the plaintiff here that petitioner think that he be ask for equitable tolling because i guess i guess this be very similar to the chief justice s question but it seem to me if somebody come in and he say I be entitle to equitable tolling and the court think no you be not equitable tolling be unavailable then what the court should do be something like this it should first say sorry equitable tolling be not available now be there a different way we can construe your petition oh maybe there be we can construe it as a sua sponte decision now in the end that be go to lead you to the same result because we do not have jurisdiction over that but that that be the proper order of thing you know first we will say oop sorry you lose equitable tolling be unavailable and then we will do whatever construe we can do to see if there be any alternative avenue and then we decide there be not no but there be a there be something and this be what the chief justice be say too there be something that the court do have jurisdiction over and it be the question of whether equitable tolling be available that be a merits question i have jurisdiction over whether equitable tolling be available i say it be not or i say it be do not matter i have jurisdiction over that question either way it have not determine whether it have jurisdiction that whether equitable tolling be available or be unavailable be be not itself a jurisdictional question that be a merits question and then when you decide that it be unavailable you can say okay be there another way to construe the thing and that end that land you in a jurisdictional question as to whether you have jurisdiction over sua sponte decision but you see there be a little bit of a problem with the way the fifth circuit be go about this thing because what the fifth circuit have do be to say that equitable tolling be unavailable and the only time it ever utter those word be in an unpublished opinion and in all the publish opinion it be just say you know we be construe this as something else and we have no jurisdiction over that and what that effectively have do be to insulate from our review the determination that the fifth circuit have make if the fifth circuit have make it that equitable tolling be unavailable he be definitely justice scalia laughter and we be not often confuse laughter ,215.2,Roberts Court,"Apr 29, 2015",Noel Reyes Mata,"Loretta Lynch, Attorney General of the United States",14-185,"Jan 16, 2015","Jun 15, 2015",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2014,Williams-Yulee v. The Florida Bar,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Pincus, I take it it follows a fortiori, from what you're saying, that the Federal canon that applies to us is unconstitutional, at least as respects to written communications, so we're not allowed to put our name on fund-raising materials and things like that. I take it you're saying that, too, that's got to go as well; is that right? I'm sorry, I really didn't get that. Why does it not -- why is -- why -- why is the restriction on us constitutional whereas-- --But, you know, I would think -- I would think it's -- it's just opposite, right, that in a case for Federal judges -- like you say, there's not really much of an interest. Who cares whether I solicit funds on behalf of my old law school. It doesn't have anything to do with what rulings I'm going to issue, who I'm going to favor, who I'm not going to favor. In this case, the State can really come in and say, you know, the things that we're objecting to, the solicitations that we're preventing are exactly the ones that are going to go to whether this judge can be an impartial judge rendering fair verdicts. Well, you're -- I'm sorry. Please. Yes. You keep on going back on that. But, I mean, do you think it would be allowable for the State to say, no, that even the chairman can't -- can't make those solicitations? So you keep on falling back, well, they allowed the chairman or they allowed the thank you notes. So now let's say, you know, the State says, look, we've been trying to do this because we've been trying to narrow the law in order to accommodate First Amendment interests; but if you're going to throw that back in our face, we'll apply it to the campaign chair, too. We'll apply it to thank you notes, too. Those will also be impermissible. Would that be constitutional?

2014,City of Los Angeles v. Patel,114,Elena Kagan,"But, Mr. Rosenkranz, why isn't this just like Barlow's really? That it's not necessary on the following rationale: Number one, most people will consent so that you go -- the police go into a hotel and say we'd like to see your registry, most people are going to consent. If somebody says no, and there's a real basis for believing that the evidence is going to be altered or destroyed, you can seize it pending judicial review, or you can get an administrative warrant ex parte and conduct a surprise examination if you want to. So we talked about all of those things in Barlow's, about how -- why that suggested that these warrantless searches were not necessary. What makes this different? What's -- What's going to -- what's going to change here? The registry is the registry, and as I said, if in an unusual case you have the feeling that the hotel is complicit, you can make sure to freeze the registry. But that's going to be an unusual case, and mostly, the registry is going to be there. And, you know, as I said mostly people are going to consent. To the extent not you can go get a warrant. A month later doesn't -- you know, it -- it's an hour later. But -- Suppose that there's a -- Mr. Rosenkranz, suppose that there's a statute that says that the taxing authority, the IRS or the equivalent on the State level, that the taxing authority can go into businesses at any time and check payroll records; and the reason is that they need to conduct these surprise, warrantless searches because there's a serious problem with businesses ginning up false payroll records. Is that constitutional? No. If the government says that they do -- the government says that if you wait till they submit everything at the end of the year, they'll falsify a lot of records, and we really need to see what's happening right now on the ground in realtime. No, you do, because you don't want to give them the time to falsify things till the end of the year. I mean, we -- we could have a thousand examples like this. I guess I don't understand that, Mr. Dreeben. You're saying that it makes a difference constitutionally whether you keep the registry at the front desk or in the back office? Mr. Dreeben, I'm trying to figure out what do you think is relevant here; so let me give you a hypo, which is say that it's not a hotel, but it's a hunting lodge. And there are recordkeeping requirements about how much people shoot and when they shoot them and what they shoot, and so forth and so on. And the fish and wildlife service or some State equivalent of that says, we do not -- we do not want to rely on people reporting this to us at periodic points, we just want to make spot inspections, surprise inspections, all the time. Would that be all right? It's a private hunting lodge, this was a private hotel. Wait, that's how you're going to distinguish it, Just because it's more important? Because the fish and wildlife people think that it's really, awfully very important to make sure that all these rules are -- are complied with. And the -- Mr. Goldstein, I thought -- And, Mr. Goldstein, I had thought that an equally important purpose behind these laws is to -- as you said earlier, prevent harassment. Prevent, I don't like this hotel owner, I want to drive this hotel out of business, I'm going to be showing up in his lobby every day. But that's part of what's going on here, isn't that right? But I think the question that Justice Scalia is asking is, is there a reason to think that hotels are a more heavily regulated industry than all the other industries that we can think of? Well, but then it's not a search at all. And, once again, it's not this statute that's doing the work. You're saying that they have no expectation of privacy. We wouldn't -- we wouldn't say it's a search at all, and the police can take it away. It doesn't depend on this statute. ",but mr rosenkranz why be not this just like barlow s really that it be not necessary on the following rationale number one most people will consent so that you go the police go into a hotel and say we would like to see your registry most people be go to consent if somebody say no and there be a real basis for believe that the evidence be go to be alter or destroy you can seize it pending judicial review or you can get an administrative warrant ex parte and conduct a surprise examination if you want to so we talk about all of those thing in barlow s about how why that suggest that these warrantless search we be not necessary what make this different what be what be go to what be go to change here the registry be the registry and as i say if in an unusual case you have the feeling that the hotel be complicit you can make sure to freeze the registry but that be go to be an unusual case and mostly the registry be go to be there and you know as i say mostly people be go to consent to the extent not you can go get a warrant a month later do not you know it it be an hour later but suppose that there be a mr rosenkranz suppose that there be a statute that say that the tax authority the irs or the equivalent on the state level that the tax authority can go into business at any time and check payroll record and the reason be that they need to conduct these surprise warrantless search because there be a serious problem with business gin up false payroll record be that constitutional no if the government say that they do the government say that if you wait till they submit everything at the end of the year they will falsify a lot of record and we really need to see what be happen right now on the ground in realtime no you do because you do not want to give them the time to falsify thing till the end of the year i mean we we could have a thousand example like this i guess i do not understand that mr dreeben you be say that it make a difference constitutionally whether you keep the registry at the front desk or in the back office mr dreeben I be try to figure out what do you think be relevant here so let me give you a hypo which be say that it be not a hotel but it be a hunt lodge and there be recordkeeping requirement about how much people shoot and when they shoot them and what they shoot and so forth and so on and the fish and wildlife service or some state equivalent of that say we do not we do not want to rely on people report this to us at periodic point we just want to make spot inspection surprise inspection all the time would that be all right it be a private hunting lodge this be a private hotel wait that be how you be go to distinguish it just because it be more important because the fish and wildlife people think that it be really awfully very important to make sure that all these rule be be comply with and the mr goldstein i think and mr goldstein i have think that an equally important purpose behind these law be to as you say early prevent harassment prevent i do not like this hotel owner i want to drive this hotel out of business I be go to be show up in his lobby every day but that be part of what be go on here be not that right but i think the question that justice scalia be ask be be there a reason to think that hotel be a more heavily regulate industry than all the other industry that we can think of well but then it be not a search at all and once again it be not this statute that be do the work you be say that they have no expectation of privacy we would not we would not say it be a search at all and the police can take it away it do not depend on this statute ,219.38,Roberts Court,"Mar 3, 2015",City of Los Angeles,"Naranjibhai Patel, et al.",13-1175,"Oct 20, 2014","Jun 22, 2015",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2014,Department of Homeland Security v. MacLean,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Gershengorn, if I could, before you get away from this, and I understand you have a statutory argument to make, but the way that the President would do this, if he wanted to do it, would be by a new executive order or, in fact, would this old Executive Order 13556, which deals with controlled unclassified information, is that what the President would use? Right. But I thought that that class -- that class of information, controlled unclassified information, as opposed to classified information, could be shared outside the government and Executive Order 13556 deals with that and the President could simply make clear that that executive order applies to this kind of information. But the place -- Mr. Gershengorn, Chrysler was -- it just said “ law ”. “ Law ” was not juxtaposed in the same sentence as another phrase that said “ law, rule and regulation ”. So that would seem, that juxtaposition of the two very different terms, would seem to defeat the Chrysler presumption. Mr. Katyal, can we go back to your legal argument, and let me make sure I understand it. You're saying don't use the revised exemption 3 standard. 114(r) is narrower than that; is that right? So that all of our exemption 3 cases essentially become irrelevant; is that right? But the -- and you're doing that based solely on the notwithstanding FOIA language; is that right? I mean, it's very general language, that's absolutely true. And if you were writing on a clean slate, you might say, gosh, that's very general language. But -- but we're not writing on a clean slate, and all our exemption 3 cases seem to suggest that very general language can meet the bar. And so I'm just looking at -- there's this case GTE Sylvania, which was a statute that prohibited disclosure, if disclosure was not fair in the circumstances and reasonably related to effectuating the purposes of the Consumer Product Safety Act. And we said that was enough, which it's like you look at that and you say, why is it enough? But that's what we said. But that suggests that we take, essentially, the same language and read it two different ways, just dependent on our sense of the purpose of the underlying statute. Is that right? But I'm just asking if we -- your decoupling argument is essentially based on the notion that these two statutes have very different purposes and, therefore, we can take those very different purposes and read the very, very similar language differently. ",mr gershengorn if i could before you get away from this and i understand you have a statutory argument to make but the way that the president would do this if he want to do it would be by a new executive order or in fact would this old executive order which deal with controlled unclassified information be that what the president would use right but i think that that class that class of information control unclassified information as oppose to classify information could be share outside the government and executive order deal with that and the president could simply make clear that that executive order applies to this kind of information but the place mr gershengorn chrysler be it just say law law be not juxtapose in the same sentence as another phrase that say law rule and regulation so that would seem that juxtaposition of the two very different term would seem to defeat the chrysler presumption mr katyal can we go back to your legal argument and let me make sure i understand it you be say do not use the revised exemption standard r be narrow than that be that right so that all of our exemption case essentially become irrelevant be that right but the and you be do that base solely on the notwithstanding foia language be that right i mean it be very general language that be absolutely true and if you we be write on a clean slate you might say gosh that be very general language but but we be not write on a clean slate and all our exemption case seem to suggest that very general language can meet the bar and so I be just look at there be this case gte sylvania which be a statute that prohibit disclosure if disclosure be not fair in the circumstance and reasonably relate to effectuate the purpose of the consumer product safety act and we say that be enough which it be like you look at that and you say why be it enough but that be what we say but that suggest that we take essentially the same language and read it two different way just dependent on our sense of the purpose of the underlie statute be that right but I be just ask if we your decouple argument be essentially base on the notion that these two statute have very different purpose and therefore we can take those very different purpose and read the very very similar language differently ,142.62,Roberts Court,"Nov 4, 2014",Department of Homeland Security,Robert J.

So is it that the court said, well, we don't know what the ceiling effect is generally, but the ceiling effect only goes to how something operates at the spinal cord level, it doesn't go to how it operates at the brain and this -- and -- this -- this takes -- what we -- what we care about is how it operates at the brain, so we don't even have to worry about ceiling effect; is that right? Is that -- Is that what the court said? So you're saying we do have to worry about the ceiling effect. There isn't this dichotomy between the drug at the spinal cord and the drug at the brain, and the -- it's actually crucial what kind of ceiling effect this drug has in -- in contradiction to what the court said, which was we didn't have to worry about ceiling effect. Is that -- Is that how it goes? How do we know that? I thought that what we knew was something different. I thought that what we knew was just what we can't know; in other words, that there's this huge range of uncertainty about what happens when somebody is -- is given this drug. You're suggesting something more than that, which is that we know what happens, we know that the drug can't maintain deep -- deep unconsciousness. Which -- which is right? Well, I thought it wasn't used for that purpose just because we don't know whether it's capable of being used for that purpose, as opposed to we know it's incapable of being used for that purpose, if you see the difference. Does the -- Does the fact that something is a lethal dose necessarily mean that it's not incredibly painful? It could be a lethal dose and be incredibly painful. Well, maybe to the extent that you can't -- Please, go ahead. Mr. Wyrick, as -- as I understand it, there were three subsidiary findings that underlay this conclusion. The first is the one that we talked a little bit about with Ms. Konrad, which has to do with the ceiling effect, which, as I understand it you, don't at all defend. The second is the idea that 500 milligrams of this drug would likely kill a patient in 30 minutes or an hour, which seems to me irrelevant given that a lethal dose is completely consistent with unbearable pain. And the third is that that dose of midazolam would keep a patient unconscious while a needle is inserted into his thigh, which also seems irrelevant given the -- what everybody understands to be the much, much, much greater potential for pain of potassium chloride. So those were the three subsidiary findings. One of them nobody thinks is anything other than gobbledygook, and the other two are irrelevant. Is that not the case? Well, it does not sound pleasant to have a needle put in your thigh. But when you read these descriptions of what midazolam does, that it gives the feeling of being burned alive, it sounds really considerably more than having a needle put in your thigh. No, no, no. I'm sorry. Potassium chloride. No, no, no. There's -- No, no, no. That's not -- that's not the point. It's a lethal dose of potassium -- of midazolam, it will take 30 minutes to die. In the meantime, the potassium chloride can be wreaking extraordinary pain on the individual. So in that sense, the fact that this is a lethal dose of midazolam has nothing to do with the question that is before us, whether, before that 30 minutes or hour passes, the potassium chloride is wreaking unbearable pain on the individual. They are pain relief medications. You know -- There is -- There is the fact that this is a lethal dose, again, completely consistent with the possibility of potassium chloride causing great pain. There is the fact that it rendered -- it keeps a patient unconscious with a needle, completely consistent with it not keeping a patient unconscious with potassium chloride running through his body, and, again, this -- this statement that nobody can figure out about the ceiling fact. But Mr. Wyrick, it would be very different if the court had said, look, we don't think you've presented enough evidence that the ceiling effect kicks in at this point, right? But that's not what the court said. The court had this alternative theory, which is that it didn't have to concern itself with whether the ceiling effect had kicked in. And that's the thing that not -- you don't defend as well. But that was what the court said. Yes. Whatever it might be, we don't have to worry about it because all we have to worry about is the brain and not the spinal cord, and in the brain, there is no ceiling effect. And that's just wrong. You know that's wrong. Well, I just read it -- I think if we go back and read it, it will show that what he was saying was we just don't have to worry about the ceiling effect because at the brain level, the ceiling effect has no relevance. Let me ask you another question. Maybe this is one we'll agree on. Maybe not. I'm not sure. Do you think that if we conclude that there is just a lot of uncertainty about this drug, in other words, you know, you might be right, or Ms. Konrad might be right, and it's really just impossible to tell. Given that nobody does studies on this drug, it would be unethical to do studies on this drug, we simply can't know the answer to these questions. If that's the state of the world, do you think it's a violation of the Eighth Amendment to use it? No. Well, you're just repeating the standard. But I'm giving you a set of -- we just don't know. It might be substantial pain; it might not be substantial pain. I mean, we can't -- we can't -- we can't quantify it at all. I guess I'm not talking about burdens. I'm talking about a district court who's presented with evidence. Just put yourself in the position of a district judge. And the evidence is who can tell? Nobody can tell. What is a district court supposed to do at that point? So then I think I have not found a place where I agree with you, because that seems -- that seems quite something to me. I mean, that would be like saying -- people say that this potassium chloride, it's like being burned alive. We've actually talked about being burned at the stake, and -- and everybody agrees that that's cruel and unusual punishment. So suppose that we said, we're going to burn you at the stake, but before we do, we're going to use an anesthetic of completely unknown properties and unknown effects. Maybe you won't feel it, maybe you will. We just can't tell. And -- and you think that that would be okay. No, I'm -- I'm saying, because you just don't know about the anesthesia. Maybe the anesthesia will cover all that -- the pain of being burned at the stake or maybe it won't. The court doesn't know. Induction, but not maintenance. And there is the world of difference between the two, isn't there? Or for -- or for the time it takes for the potassium chloride to kill somebody. I guess the question I was asking was if a person was burned alive and we didn't know whether he had appropriate anesthesia, would that be unconstitutional, too? Because potassium chloride -- -- is kind of like that, isn't it? It's being burned alive from the inside. That's what it is. You see, but potassium chloride is burning somebody alive. It's just doing it through the use in a -- of a drug. ",ms konrad can i make sure i understand this because you know i read that the part of the opinion that you be refer to and i just really could not figure it out so be it that the court say well we do not know what the ceiling effect be generally but the ceiling effect only go to how something operate at the spinal cord level it do not go to how it operate at the brain and this and this this take what we what we care about be how it operate at the brain so we do not even have to worry about ceiling effect be that right be that be that what the court say so you be say we do have to worry about

be not incredibly painful it could be a lethal dose and be incredibly painful well maybe to the extent that you can not please go ahead mr wyrick as as i understand it there we be three subsidiary finding that underlay this conclusion the first be the one that we talk a little bit about with ms konrad which have to do with the ceiling effect which as i understand it you do not at all defend the

2014,"Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. v. Busk",114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Clement -- excuse me -- can I give you a hypo? Suppose that there's an employer with cash registers, and there's a very extensive process for closing out the cash registers, and that extensive process is to protect against theft. If it weren't for that concern, you could close out a cash register much more quickly. Or the same for bank tellers or the same for casino dealers, you know, that there's, like, a 20-minute process which is essentially an antitheft security process. And it happens at the end of the shift when the cashier goes off duty. What's the difference between that case and going through security in -- at Amazon? Do you know, by the way? I mean, before you get on to that, do you know how that's treated under the law? Because I guess my assumption was that this kind of period would be treated as compensable. But if that's not right, let me know. That would seem to make it depend on a compete fortuity. You know, if I -- if I have the cashier walk from the -- the -- with her tray to the manager's station and do the same thing there on the way out the door, there would be one answer, and if she does it at the cashier's station, it would be another answer. And that seems not particularly sensible. Actually, Amazon, I don't think you can. I mean, what makes Amazon Amazon? It's a system of inventory control that betters everybody else in the business. And what's really important to Amazon is that it know where every toothbrush in the warehouse is. And that's just as integral to what Amazon does and to what it requires its employees to do as, for example, the -- I'm going back to my hypos -- but the person who closes out the cash register, the person who closes out the bank teller operation, is that this is sort of a necessary part of what -- of what the -- the folks who do all the stocking and the unshelving and shelving do at Amazon. But is the idea, then, Mr. Gannon, just -- you know, it's basically a door test? I mean, portal to portal. It might make sense just to have a door test, exits and entrances. Can I give you a different hypo, which is similar to some of the ones that have been floating around in a brief, but it's actually based on real life circumstances. There was a judge ages ago in the Southern District of New York who had his clerks -- all that they did was help him with his opinions and his cases and that was their principal activity, but had his clerks come early in order to cut his grapefruit and otherwise make breakfast for him. And would that be compensable? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess I just don't understand that, Mr. Gannon, because, as Justice Kennedy said, the point of my hypo was that it's not part of the job. It's actually an antitheft mechanism. The cash could be taken somewhere much more quickly and much more easily if the employer were not worried about the employee pocketing some of it, you know. I mean, you could just put it in a big bag, versus going through this very, very careful sort of inventory control. The other way to look at this is that the reason why checking in and checking out is not compensable is because it does have to do with this going in and going out. You know, it's all about ingress and egress, and that's what the Portal-to-Portal Act was about. And if I make you go through a security gate as part of getting out of a factory, then it just becomes part of this -- the principal design of the Portal-to-Portal Act was about going in and going out and this is part of that. Are these employees unionized? But you, certainly, Mr. Clement, make it part of the egress process. I mean, if this is just ingress/egress and I -- I -- seems as though that's part of what the Portal-to-Portal Act does. Why not make it part of the egress process and then there would be a wholly different outcome; is that right? I gave it to you two ways. And one was at your work station and the other was an employer, who knowing that there was this ingress/egress rule, made it part of the ingress/egress process. So that's my other question repeated again. ",mr clement excuse me can i give you a hypo suppose that there be an employer with cash register and there be a very extensive process for close out the cash register and that extensive process be to protect against theft if it be not for that concern you could close out a cash register much more quickly or the same for bank teller or the same for casino dealer you know that there be like a minute process which be essentially an antitheft security process and it happen at the end of the shift when the cashier go off duty what be the difference between that case and go through security in at amazon do you know by the way i mean before you get on to that do you know how that be treat under the law because i guess my assumption be that this kind of period would be treat as compensable but if that be not right let me know that would seem to make it depend on a compete fortuity you know if i if i have the cashier walk from the the with her tray to the manager s station and do the same thing there on the way out the door there would be one answer and if she do it at the cashier s station it would be another answer and that seem not particularly sensible actually amazon i do not think you can i mean what make amazon amazon it be a system of inventory control that better everybody else in the business and what be really important to amazon be that it know where every toothbrush in the warehouse be and that be just as integral to what amazon do and to what it require its employee to do as for example the I be go back to my hypo but the person who close out the cash register the person who close out the bank teller operation be that this be sort of a necessary part of what of what the the folk who do all the stocking and the unshelving and shelve do at amazon but be the idea then mr gannon just you know it be basically a door test i mean portal to portal it might make sense just to have a door test exit and entrance can i give you a different hypo which be similar to some of the one that have be float around in a brief but it be actually base on real life circumstance there be a judge age ago in the southern district of new york who have his clerk all that they do be help him with his opinion and his case and that be their principal activity but have his clerk come early in order to cut his grapefruit and otherwise make breakfast for him and would that be compensable yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i guess i just do not understand that mr gannon because as justice kennedy say the point of my hypo be that it be not part of the job it be actually an antitheft mechanism the cash could be take somewhere much more quickly and much more easily if the employer we be not worry about the employee pocket some of it you know i mean you could just put it in a big bag versus go through this very very careful sort of inventory control the other way to look at this be that the reason why checking in and check out be not compensable be because it do have to do with this go in and go out you know it be all about ingres and egress and that be what the portal to portal act be about and if i make you go through a security gate as part of get out of a factory then it just become part of this the principal design of the portal to portal act be about go in and go out and this be part of that be these employee unionize but you certainly mr clement make it part of the egress process i mean if this be just ingressegress and i i seem as though that be part of what the portal to portal act do why not make it part of the egress process and then there would be a wholly different outcome be that right i give it to you two way and one be at your work station and the other be an employer who know that there be this ingressegress rule make it part of the ingressegress process so that be my other question repeat again ,258.9899999999999,Roberts Court,"Oct 8, 2014","Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc.","Jesse Busk, et al.",13-433,"Mar 3, 2014","Dec 9, 2014",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2014,"Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc.",114,Elena Kagan,"Well, suppose -- Well, Mr. Gershengorn, I mean, so that does raise the question if yours is less than certainty, how much less than certainty is it? I mean, suppose I'm an employer, and I say, you know, I don't honestly know, I think. You know, it's two out of three. Is that sufficient? Is that true even if it's -- Is that true even if it's under 50 percent? In other words, say that employer says, you know, I really don't know, but I think there's, like, a 50/50 chance or even a 40 percent chance that this person has a religious -- that -- has religious -- that this practice is religious. And I don't really feel like getting into all this accommodation stuff, so I'm not going to hire this person. So it doesn't really depend on what the percentage chance is. It could be certain, it could be less than certain, it could be a lot less than certain, as long as the employer says there's some chance, and I'm not going to hire, or promote, or fire, or whatever, because of that chance. Now, Mr. Dvoretzky, suppose an employer just doesn't want to hire any Jews, and somebody walks in and his name is Mel Goldberg, and he looks kind of Jewish and the employer doesn't know he's Jewish. No absolute certainty and certainly Mr. Goldberg doesn't say anything about being Jewish, but the employer just operates on an assumption that he's Jewish, so no, he doesn't get the job. Is that a violation? That has got to be against the law, right? It doesn't matter whether the employer -- (Laughter.) It doesn't matter whether the employer knows it to an absolute certainty, right? But the thing about my question was, is that what this statute does is to say that if you are, in fact, wearing a headscarf for religious reasons, that your neutral policy really doesn't matter, it only matters if you -- if there's an undue burden and you really can't make an accommodation, but except for that, it really doesn't matter. You just have to hire me, even if I'm wearing a headscarf. And so the fact that you don't know that I'm wearing a headscarf for religious reasons, that you only kind of assume that, because most people do wear headscarves for religious reasons, it shouldn't make any more difference than in the hypothetical that I gave. But you're essentially saying that the problem with the rule is that it requires Abercrombie to engage in what might be thought of as an awkward conversation, to ask some questions. Now, people can disagree about whether one can ask those questions in a way that's awkward at all, but you're saying we should structure the whole legal system to make sure that there is no possibility of that awkward conversation ever taking place. But the alternative to that rule is a rule where Abercrombie just gets to say, we're going to stereotype people and prevent them from getting jobs. We'll never have the awkward conversation because we're just going to cut these people out and make sure that they never become Abercrombie employees. Now, between those two options, the option of using a stereotype to make sure that somebody never gets a job and using a stereotype to have an awkward conversation, which does this statute seem to think is the worst problem? ",well suppose well mr gershengorn i mean so that do raise the question if yours be less than certainty how much less than certainty be it i mean suppose I be an employer and i say you know i do not honestly know i think you know it be two out of three be that sufficient be that true even if it be be that true even if it be under percent in other word say that employer say you know i really do not know but i think there be like a chance or even a percent chance that this person have a religious that have religious that this practice be religious and i do not really feel like get into all this accommodation stuff so I be not go to hire this person so it do not really depend on what the percentage chance be it could be certain it could be less than certain it could be a lot less than certain as long as the employer say there be some chance and I be not go to hire or promote or fire or whatever because of that chance now mr dvoretzky suppose an employer just do not want to hire any jew and somebody walk in and his name be mel goldberg and he look kind of jewish and the employer do not know he be jewish no absolute certainty and certainly mr goldberg do not say anything about be jewish but the employer just operate on an assumption that he be jewish so no he do not get the job be that a violation that have get to be against the law right it do not matter whether the employer laughter it do not matter whether the employer know it to an absolute certainty right but the thing about my question be be that what this statute do be to say that if you be in fact wear a headscarf for religious reason that your neutral policy really do not matter it only matter if you if there be an undue burden and you really can not make an accommodation but except for that it really do not matter you just have to hire me even if I be wear a headscarf and so the fact that you do not know that I be wear a headscarf for religious reason that you only kind of assume that because most people do wear headscarf for religious reason it should not make any more difference than in the hypothetical that i give but you be essentially say that the problem with the rule be that it require abercrombie to engage in what might be think of as an awkward conversation to ask some question now people can disagree about whether one can ask those question in a way that be awkward at all but you be say we should structure the whole legal system to make sure that there be no possibility of that awkward conversation ever take place but the alternative to that rule be a rule where abercrombie just get to say we be go to stereotype people and prevent them from get job we will never have the awkward conversation because we be just go to cut these people out and make sure that they never become abercrombie employee now between those two option the option of use a stereotype to make sure that somebody never get a job and use a stereotype to have an awkward conversation which do this statute seem to think be the bad problem ,185.65000000000003,Roberts Court,"Feb 25, 2015",Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,"Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc.",14-86,"Oct 2, 2014","Jun 1, 2015",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2014,"Oneok, Inc. et al. v. Learjet, Inc. et al.",114,Elena Kagan,"So let's assume-- --Let's assume that that's true, Mr. Katyal, that they are trying to regulate a means that's a common practice to both markets. And let's assume that because of that, FERC clearly does have authority to regulate in this area. The question is whether FERC's authority should be exclusive or whether it could be concurrent, not field preemption. Right? There would still be a kind of rule of the road, even when field preemption runs out, conflict preemption takes over, and it might be that if the state regulation interfered with the goals and objectives of the federal regulation, the federal regulation would trump. But I don't really see a reason in this kind of case why you would exclude the state entirely, even if nothing the state was doing was conflicting with federal regulation or federal policy. Well, then what's the-- --this area is the question. I mean, yes, there is some field preemption, but why should the field preemption carry into a sphere where the practice being regulated is commonly affected, both wholesales sales, which are clearly in the bailiwick of the federal government, and retail sales which are just as clearly in the bailiwick of the state? Mr. Katyal, suppose the following hypothetical: Suppose there is a company and it has ten customers and five of the customers are wholesalers and five of the customers are retailers, so it is a jurisdictional seller. And it says to the retailers, We're going to charge you whatever we charge to the wholesalers plus 20 percent. That's what it says to the retailers. And then it lies to the retailers about the price that it's charged the wholesalers. All right? Do the States have power to regulate that, that fraudulent communication to the retailers about what they're charging the wholesalers? Just to make sure I understand, you are essentially saying my hypothetical is like this case and the States would be divested of authority because -- even though the company is having this direct interaction with the retailers because it's pegged to wholesale rates? But you are saying, Mr. Yang, that even if the regulation is directed toward a retail transaction, if it directly affects the wholesale rate, you have field preemption over that? Does the -- the State is regulating a transaction with the retailer, and you are saying because that transaction has these direct effects on the wholesale market and wholesale prices, that that gives you field preemption, that that falls within the category of things which the State is simply not allowed to do irrespective of whether there is any conflict with Federal law or policy. Okay. So tell me what it is. No, no, no. They are regulating a transaction with a retailer. It's not a price thing. They are regulating a transaction in the way that they are in this case. I mean, all these false sales, some of them are coming out of wholesale sales, and some of them are coming out of retail sales. And the States here are regulating transactions that involve-- --Well, I thought a lot of these were false sales themselves. And some of those real trades are real trades with retailers. Can I ask Justice Kennedy's question again to you, Mr. Yang, which is if -- if this were a conflict preemption regime, is there a conflict? Sure, that seems right. But I mean, is there anything that FERC has said now about these practices that would suggest a conflict with this state regulation? Well, it intended field preemption to apply as to wholesalers. It didn't intend field preemption to apply as to a retailers. So as I understand your argument, Mr. Fisher, you are rejecting the Ninth Circuit's analysis. Because the Ninth Circuit -- it's a little bit confusing, but I read the Ninth Circuit to say that FERC just had no authority over these transactions. I think that goes a lot further than anything we've ever done. I mean, the jurisdictional sellers, as I understand this industry, that there are a lot of companies that sell both to wholesalers and to retailers and always before, I think, we've looked at the transaction and said, Where is the transaction, is the transaction a wholesale transaction or a retail transaction? Not, oh, look. You engaged in one wholesale transaction last year, and that insulates you from everything. ",so let us assume let us assume that that be true mr katyal that they be try to regulate a mean that be a common practice to both market and let us assume that because of that ferc clearly do have authority to regulate in this area the question be whether ferc s authority should be exclusive or whether it could be concurrent not field preemption right there would still be a kind of rule of the road even when field preemption run out conflict preemption take over and it might be that if the state regulation interfere with the goal and objective of the federal regulation the federal regulation would trump but i do not really see a reason in this kind of case why you would exclude the state entirely even if nothing the state be do be conflict with federal regulation or federal policy well then what be the this area be the question i mean yes there be some field preemption but why should the field preemption carry into a sphere where the practice be regulate be commonly affect both wholesale sale which be clearly in the bailiwick of the federal government and retail sale which be just as clearly in the bailiwick of the state mr katyal suppose the following hypothetical suppose there be a company and it have ten customer and five of the customer be wholesaler and five of the customer be retailer so it be a jurisdictional seller and it say to the retailer we be go to charge you whatever we charge to the wholesaler plus percent that be what it say to the retailer and then it lie to the retailer about the price that it be charge the wholesaler all right do the state have power to regulate that that fraudulent communication to the retailer about what they be charge the wholesaler just to make sure i understand you be essentially say my hypothetical be like this case and the state would be divest of authority because even though the company be have this direct interaction with the retailer because it be peg to wholesale rate but you be say mr yang that even if the regulation be direct toward a retail transaction if it directly affect the wholesale rate you have field preemption over that do the the state be regulate a transaction with the retailer and you be say because that transaction have these direct effect on the wholesale market and wholesale price that that give you field preemption that that fall within the category of thing which the state be simply not allow to do irrespective of whether there be any conflict with federal law or policy okay so tell me what it be no no no they be regulate a transaction with a retailer it be not a price thing they be regulate a transaction in the way that they be in this case i mean all these false sale some of them be come out of wholesale sale and some of them be come out of retail sale and the state here be regulate transaction that involve well i think a lot of these we be false sale themselves and some of those real trade be real trade with retailer can i ask justice kennedy s question again to you mr yang which be if if this we be a conflict preemption regime be there a conflict sure that seem right but i mean be there anything that ferc have say now about these practice that would suggest a conflict with this state regulation well it intend field preemption to apply as to wholesaler it do not intend field preemption to apply as to a retailer so as i understand your argument mr fisher you be reject the ninth circuit s analysis because the ninth circuit it be a little bit confusing but i read the ninth circuit to say that ferc just have no authority over these transaction i think that go a lot far than anything we have ever do i mean the jurisdictional seller as i understand this industry that there be a lot of company that sell both to wholesaler and to retailer and always before i think we have look at the transaction and say where be the transaction be the transaction a wholesale transaction or a retail transaction not oh look you engage in one wholesale transaction last year and that insulate you from everything ,273.4,Roberts Court,"Jan 12, 2015","Oneok, Inc. et al.","Learjet, Inc. et al.",13-271,"Jul 1, 2014","Apr 21, 2015",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2014,Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Association,114,Elena Kagan,"Could I ask about that, Mr. Kneedler, because it seems to me that part of what's motivating that Respondent's position and their amici's position, and I'm not sure that this maps on very well to the Paralyzed Veterans doctrine, but part of what's motivating it is a sense that agencies more and more are using interpretative rules and are using guidance documents to make law and that there is -- it's essentially an end run around the notice and comment provisions. Now, whether that has anything to do with Paralyzed Veterans or not -- I mean, what would the government say is the correction for that or the remedy for that or -- I mean, because the government is sort of asking for it all. It's asking for a lot of deference always, it's asking for the removal of the Paralyzed Veterans doctrine, it's asking for a pretty strict demarcation between interpretative and legislative rules. So what's the solution to the problem that I think the Respondents are basically identifying? But, Mr. Kneedler, one of the very strange things about this case is that I thought that in SmithKline and I recognize that the government probably doesn't like this aspect of SmithKline but that SmithKline basically says when it comes to Auer deference, if the interpretation has been unstable over time and if the interpretation has created a kind of unfair surprise for private parties, that those interpretations do not get Auer deference. So the very kinds of interpretations that we're talking about here, which is revised and amended interpretations, they don't get Auer deference in the first place. So this whole notion that we're supposed to be so worried about this because we're going to give it Auer deference, well, we don't. Ms. Ho, I think that this entire case has been litigated with everybody accepting that this was an interpretative rule. Now, maybe that was wrong. Maybe you should have come in in the first instance and said, really, we think this is a legislative rule and so it had to go through notice and comment. But you didn't do that. Everything that happened in this case happened on the view that this was an interpretative rule and the question is what followed from that classification. Yes. But to the contrary, Ms. Ho, I mean, the entire Paralyzed Veterans Doctrine is about when interpretative rules get notice and comment, have to get notice and comment, if ever. It's not about the division line between interpretative rules and legislative rules. So when the D.C. Circuit starts citing Paralyzed Veterans, it's on the assumption that what we're talking about is an interpretative rule. It's not just loose language. If you go back to Paralyzed Veterans itself, they deal with two arguments. The first argument is what's become known as the Paralyzed Veterans Doctrine and then they say, oh, you know, there's another argument in the case, which is that this isn't an interpretative rule at all. Well-- --Ms. Ho, can I take you back to what-- --I thought was the question in this case, which has to do with the Paralyzed Veterans doctrine. And I guess what I would like for you to do is simply to try to explain that doctrine to me, and on the view that is a doctrine about interpretative rules and what it says is that there are occasions when interpretative rules must be done through notice and comment and that those occasions are when the interpretative rules make a significant revision to a stable -- a prior stable interpretation. So could you explain to me just why that is so? Well, why-- --I think I understand that but it seems to me that that would apply as well to the initial interpretation as to the revised interpretation. In other words, if you really want to say an interpretation somehow changes the legislative regulation, then that happens at the moment the interpretation takes place, doesn't it? Yes, but again-- --Auer deference actually is more strong with respect to the initial determination than -- initial interpretation than with respect to a revised interpretation. So I don't think Auer deference can save you from this little conundrum. The conundrum is why it is that an interpretation should be viewed as -- as changing the regulation such that notice and comment is necessary when it's a second interpretation but not when it's a first-- --Well, Ms. Ho, I think that you've just said that Paralyzed Veterans is wrong then, because, I mean, the D.C. Circuit has two lines of precedent. One line of precedent is all about how to distinguish between legislative and interpretative rules, and I forget what the principal case is but there is a four-part test, and that's what it uses. And Paralyzed Veterans it uses for a different purpose altogether, which is that when it's decided that something is an interpretative rule, there is still another question to be asked which is whether that interpretative rule revises a a previously stable interpretation. That's it. No, but it's an amendment of the legislative rule-- --Of the regulation. I understand the fourth prong of American Mining to be essentially the question of whether the interpretation is in conflict with the previous regulation. But then, I mean, go back to what Justice Scalia asked you, which is that if you drop this kind of reinterpretation of Paralyzed Veterans and you assume that what we are dealing with here is an interpretative rule, then you don't think notice and comment is required. ",could i ask about that mr kneedler because it seem to me that part of what be motivate that respondent s position and their amici s position and I be not sure that this map on very well to the paralyzed veteran doctrine but part of what be motivate it be a sense that agency more and more be use interpretative rule and be use guidance document to make law and that there be it be essentially an end run around the notice and comment provision now whether that have anything to do with paralyzed veteran or not i mean what would the government say be the correction for that or the remedy for

you should have come in in the first instance and say really we think this be a legislative rule and so it have to go through notice and comment but you do not do that everything that happen in this

2014,Direct Marketing Association v. Brohl,114,Elena Kagan,"But suppose it weren't the taxpayer. I mean, suppose a State has a form that's equivalent to the Federal W-2, requiring employers to say how much wages have been paid. And suppose the employer itself challenges the use of that form, what do you think the result is in that case? But where -- where do you get, Mr. Isaacson, this idea that the -- the plaintiff has to be the taxpayer? Because certainly the text of the statute does not say that. The text of the statute speaks to what kinds of remedies a court can give. It does not speak to what kind of plaintiffs have to bring the lawsuit. I guess I don't -- what I don't understand about your statutory argument, I mean, it seems a kind of natural thing for somebody to say suppose it's like we're going to all have pizza tonight, and we're going to take up a collection to buy the pizza. And I assign one of my clerks, go collect the money for the pizza. So what that clerk is going to do is he's going to figure out who it is that's going to owe the money, right? Who's going to partake of the pizza, so who owes the money. And then, you know, maybe he's going to send an e-mail to those people and he's going to say you owe this money for pizza. And then if no -- if somebody doesn't pay, he's going to identify the delinquent and -- and say, really, you owe this money for pizza. So that's all part of the collection process, isn't it? I mean, basically, identifying -- informing the -- the people who have to pay, informing the people who have to pay and identifying the people who don't pay, and -- and the amounts that they owe. But it's importance for a reason. It's importance to enable them to collect. Essentially the State is saying we're not going to be able to collect this tax unless we do these things, unless we tell people that they, in fact, owe the tax and unless we have a mechanism to make sure that people who don't pay the tax are identified. And that's what all these forms are all about. It's about collecting a tax that most people do not pay. But wouldn't you agree that in any case in which a -- a government goes about collecting the tax it has to say how are we going to collect this tax. And this is just this State's answer to the how are we going to collect this tax. Well, what we're going to do is that we're going to inform people that they owe the tax and then we're going to get information that enables us to make sure that the delinquents pay up. That's how we're going to collect it.

2014,"Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc.",114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Jay-- --I -- I just want to make sure I understand your answer to what the gap is between a certain kind of fact and then the ultimate question of law. So when an expert gets on the stand and gives testimony about what a person in the field, a skilled artisan in the field, would understand to be the meaning of a particular patent term, and you are saying that that's a -- that's factual and that the decision whether to credit that or not is a factual determination. But how is that different from the ultimate legal question that the Court has to answer, which is kind of the same thing, it's how a person -- a skilled artisan in the field, what -- what that person would understand a patent to mean. So what you're saying is that in certain cases the factual finding truly is the legal determination, but that in other cases, other matters can come in to drive a wedge between the two. But how would you define the standard? I mean, it's absolutely true what Justice Scalia says, that at a certain level of generality there is a gap. But I thought that in order to determine liability, what the court has to inquire into is how a person with ordinary skill in the relevant art at the time of the invention would understand the claim. And that seems like exactly the question that the expert is testifying to. But suppose an expert just says, in my field skilled artisans think that molecular weight means the following. Is that a -- and then the district court accepts that finding. Is that a factual determination in your view? Because I think Mr. Jay would say it is. Mr. Phillips-- --I'm sorry. Is your argument that there are no subordinate factual determinations in these kinds of cases or as you opened by saying, as your argument, sure, there are factual determinations; we can come up with a zillion of them, but it's not worth the candle to figure out which is which. But Mr. Phillips, if that's your argument, I mean, then you'd just have to deal with Rule 52(a) because Rule 52(a) sets out the very blanket rule. It doesn't say except where it's not worth the candle. It just says what it says, that these are matters for the trial court. Mr. Phillips, there might be very different kinds of factual determinations that are relevant to patentability than are relevant to interpretation of a statute, so let me just give you one. I mean, suppose that the validity of a patent depended on when a particular invention was made. You know, was it done in 1980 or was it done in 2000. And that was absolutely critical to your determination of whether a patent was valid. But that seems like so within the province of the trial court and-- --How do I deal with that? So a question of fact which the trial court ought to get deference on, no? I see, but are you saying that there aren't similar things that could arise within the context of claim construction, just different people's view of what the facts on the ground are? You know, is molecular weight usually measured in kilodaltons or something else.

2014,Comptroller of the Treasury of Maryland v. Wynne,114,Elena Kagan,"You only have to look at the tax scheme as a whole including the tax on nonresidents? I mean-- --Mr. Feigin, if we were to rule against Maryland, how many States are in the same position as Maryland, either because they do a county tax themselves or because they allow local jurisdictions to impose their own taxes? Well, don't some States allow localities to impose taxes that do not give a credit? So, for example, the New York City income tax would be the classic example of that. Mr. Perella, you're not saying that we have to or that we should establish a priority rule as to different taxing schemes, do -- are you? You're not saying it has to be source-based over residence-based, or -- or vice versa? So you are saying that that's the priority rule. Well, let me ask you: I mean, suppose we were to say what Maryland is doing is not okay, but then States could choose. Some would do a source-based tax, some would do a residency-based tax. And if you had a situation like that, it seems it could lead to double taxation in exactly this kind of way. If you were living in the wrong State and all of a sudden the combination of one State having a pure source-based and one State having a pure residency-based tax was going to lead to double taxation. Why is that any different? Mr. Perella, we said in this American Trucking case, we said we were going to allow States to impose a neutral, local tax even though it violated internal consistency. Why shouldn't we see this as pretty equivalent to American Trucking? In other words, a State saying, we're going to impose a small tax to ensure that you are paying for some of the very basic services that we provide. I'm sure that if you aggregate the American Trucking tax, it was a lot of money, too. But why doesn't Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical, isn't it exactly the same as the American Trucking hypothetical? You just distinguished the flat tax versus the percentage income tax. I thought that that was your principal distinction of American Trucking. I thought that that was what Justice Sotomayor was positing, a flat fee for use of the State schools and everything else that comes along with being a State resident. ",you only have to look at the tax scheme as a whole include the tax on nonresident i mean mr feigin if we we be to rule against maryland how many state be in the same position as maryland either because they do a county tax themselves or because they allow local jurisdiction to impose their own tax well do not some state allow locality to impose tax that do not give a credit so for example the new york city income tax would be the classic example of that mr perella you be not say that we have to or that we should establish a priority rule as to different tax scheme do be you you be not say it have to be source base over residence base or or vice versa so you be say that that be the priority rule well let me ask you i mean suppose we we be to say what maryland be do be not okay but then state could choose some would do a source base tax some would do a residency base tax and if you have a situation like that it seem it could lead to double taxation in exactly this kind of way if you we be live in the wrong state and all of a sudden the combination of one state have a pure source base and one state have a pure residency base tax be go to lead to double taxation why be that any different mr perella we say in this american trucking case we say we we be go to allow state to impose a neutral local tax even though it violate internal consistency why should not we see this as pretty equivalent to american trucking in other word a state say we be go to impose a small tax to ensure that you be pay for some of the very basic service that we provide I be sure that if you aggregate the american trucking tax it be a lot of money too but why do not justice sotomayor s hypothetical be not it exactly the same as the american trucking hypothetical you just distinguish the flat tax versus the percentage income tax i think that that be your principal distinction of american trucking i think that that be what justice sotomayor be posit a flat fee for use of the state school and everything else that come along with be a state resident ,129.31,Roberts Court,"Nov 12, 2014",Maryland State Comptroller of Treasury,Brian Wynne et ux.,13-485,"May 27, 2014","May 18, 2015",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2014,"Jesinoski v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc.",114,Elena Kagan,"So why do you think it is that Congress didn't say how we resolve disputes in this context? But Congress couldn't have thought that every time there was a notification, the -- the lender was going to agree with the borrower that it was appropriate. Congress must have thought that -- that there were going to be some cases where the lender and the borrower disagreed, and yet Congress didn't say anything about how those cases would be resolved and that's a puzzling feature of this statute. Well, that seems right, Mr. Waxman, that people understood that there would be litigation and (g) is an acknowledgment of that. It's an acknowledgment that there are going to be some suits out there and it might be a Declaratory Judgment Act or it might be a foreclosure proceeding or it might be a bankruptcy proceeding, in which the question of rescission was going to come up and on which it was going to be adjudicated. And all that (g) says is that in those cases the court can award not only rescission but damages. But that's hardly a requirement that the borrower bring suit subject -- you know, bring suit subject to the (f) clause of 3 years. It's just not the way you would write a dispute resolution provision. But, Mr. Waxman, if that's right, so exercising the right to rescind is by notice. But then you look at (f) and it says, ""an obligor's right of rescission shall expire. "" So I read that and I say, okay, that means when you can no longer exercise your right to rescind, which you've just said is when you can send notice. So that's what expires after three years, your ability to send notice. But it just says right there it's the right to rescission shall expire, and you agree that exercising the right of rescission is done by notice.

Subject to the policy control of Congress, which Congress exercises pretty much on a routine basis, it's entirely funded by Congress, all the members of the board are appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, save the -- save one. You know, I guess I'm just wondering other than this label, what suggests that this is not the government? Yes. We rejected that argument. Mr. Dupree, I mean, one way to look at this on the delegation question, not on the due process question but on the delegation question, is that there is government all over this at every step, that there is all kinds of supervision of Amtrak itself, no matter what Amtrak does that; but with respect to the metrics and standards, particularly, that there is no way Amtrak is actually going to be able to get anything unless the FRA comes aboard, and that furthermore, that even those metrics and standards are useless unless the Surface Transportation Board decides to enforce the preference requirement. So there is, like, no place at which a private actor can do something itself in this scheme, it would seem to me. ",mr gannon be the be the government able to award damage without the showing that there be be a violation of the metric and standard but i would think if that be the case if the statutory preference do not get be a if a violation of the statutory preference do not get you all the way to damage if there be essentially a second requirement which be a violation of the metric and standard i mean in effect what the a statute do be it say there be two thing you need to show a violation of the preference and a violation of the metric and standard in order to get to damage that seem if if that be the case it seem kind of regulatory well but to the extent practicable i mean what do that mean do you think that be dispositive because I have always think that the label that congress decide to put on these thing be not of particular relevance well the post office be suppose to be a for profit corporation too to the same extent right but then that all go back to label i mean i guess I be just wonder what about amtrak be not governmental other than the label subject to the policy control of congress which congress exercise pretty much on a routine basis it be entirely fund by congress all the member of the board be appoint by the president with the advice and consent of the senate save the save one you know i guess I be just wonder other than this label what suggest that this be not the government yes we reject that argument mr dupree i mean one way to look at this on the delegation question not on the due process question but on the delegation question be that there be government all over this at every step that there be all kind of supervision of amtrak itself no matter what amtrak do that but with respect to the metric and standard particularly that there be no way amtrak be actually go to be able to get anything unless the fra come aboard and that furthermore that even those metric and standard be useless unless the surface transportation board decide to enforce the preference requirement so there be like no place at which a private actor can do something itself in this scheme it would seem to me ,132.6,Roberts Court,"Dec 8, 2014","U.S. Department of Transportation, et al.",Association of American Railroads,13-1080,"Jun 23, 2014","Mar 9, 2015",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2014,"Texas Dept. of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project, Inc.",114,Elena Kagan,"But if I could understand your point, General Keller, you agree with Justice Scalia that ""make unavailable"", it's -- like ""adversely affects"", they're -- they're both verbs. ""Make unavailable"" is just one way to adversely affect. And what you're pinning your argument on is these extra added words in the Title VII statute, right? So that it's -- in the -- in the Title VII statute, it's -- can't even find them. You know what I mean. Okay. So -- but I don't -- I don't think that that could possibly be right, because then you would be saying that it would be a different statute if, instead of just saying here an employer can't make unavailable, but instead it said an employer can't act in a way that makes unavailable. That would make it completely parallel to the Title VII and the ADEA statutes. And -- and those two things just can't mean the same thing. I mean, all it's doing is to take out a few words, but it's saying the exact same thing, which is either way, an employer can't make unavailable. No, but the -- but the thing that's different in this statute is the ""make unavailable"", which focuses on an effect in the same way that the ""adversely affect"" language does. And it just does it a little bit more economically, but the effects-based nature of the provision is still the same. But the law where it found it here was very clear, because ten circuits had gone the other way and had said that disparate impact was a valid action under the FHA. So leaving the law where you found it, and we presume that Congress knows the law, especially when the law is that clear and that uniform, means, yes, there will be disparate-impact actions except in these three circumstances which we're going to lay out for you very clearly and very precisely. Of course not, but-- Mr. Daniel, I had thought that Justice Scalia's question was whether the ""because of"" language precludes a disparate-impact theory; in other words, whether the ""because of"" language signals that it has to have a certain kind of intent which is not part of a disparate treatment, a disparate-impact theory. And I would have thought that your main argument about that is, well, actually, the Court has held numerous times, in the Title VII context, in the ADEA context, in the Rehabilitation Act context, in the Emergency School Aid Act context, that that ""because of"" language can be read to include disparate-impact claims, and that it's at least ambiguous as to whether it should be read so in this case as to this particular statute. I mean, is that your argument, or is your argument something else? And General, could I just ask -- I don't know a lot about this area and I take it that one of the things that you are warning us against is seeing the entire area through the prism of this one quite unusual case. And you've referred a few times to sort of the Heartland cases without really getting out what the Heartland cases are. So, for me, what are they? ",but if i could understand your point general keller you agree with justice scalia that make unavailable it be like adversely affect they be they be both verb make unavailable be just one way to adversely affect and what you be pin your argument on be these extra add word in the title vii statute right so that it be in the in the title vii statute it be can not even find them you know what i mean okay so but i do not i do not think that that could possibly be right because then you would be say that it would be a different statute if instead of just say here an employer can not make unavailable but instead it say an employer can not act in a way that make unavailable that would make it completely parallel to the title vii and the adea statute and and those two thing just can not mean the same thing i mean all it be do be to take out a few word but it be say the exact same thing which be either way an employer can not make unavailable no but the but the thing that be different in this statute be the make unavailable which focus on an effect in the same way that the adversely affect language do and it just do it a little bit more economically but the effect base nature of the provision be still the same but the law where it find it here be very clear because ten circuit have go the other way and have say that disparate impact be a valid action under the fha so leave the law where you find it and we presume that congress know the law especially when the law be that clear and that uniform mean yes there will be disparate impact action except in these three circumstance which we be go to lay out for you very clearly and very precisely of course not but mr daniel i have think that justice scalia s question be whether the because of language preclude a disparate impact theory in other word whether the because of language signal that it have to have a certain kind of intent which be not part of a disparate treatment a disparate impact theory and i would have think that your main argument about that be well actually the court have hold numerous time in the title vii context in the adea context in the rehabilitation act context in the emergency school aid act context that that because of language can be read to include disparate impact claim and that it be at least ambiguous as to whether it should be read so in this case as to this particular statute i mean be that your argument or be your argument something else and general could i just ask i do not know a lot about this area and i take it that one of the thing that you be warn us against be see the entire area through the prism of this one quite unusual case and you have refer a few time to sort of the heartland case without really get out what the heartland case be so for me what be they ,199.14,Roberts Court,"Jan 21, 2015","Texas Dept. of Housing and Community Affairs, et al.","The Inclusive Communities Project, Inc.",13-1371,"Oct 2, 2014","Jun 25, 2015",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2014,Obergefell v. Hodges,114,Elena Kagan,"Ms. Bonauto, maybe I'm just not understanding Justice Scalia's question, but for example, there are many rabbis that will not conduct marriages between Jews and non-Jews, notwithstanding that we have a constitutional prohibition against religious discrimination. And those rabbis get all the powers and privileges of the State, even if they have that rule, most -- many, many, many rabbis won't do that. Mr. Bursch, I -- I understand that argument. It's the principal argument that you make in -- in your briefs, that same-sex marriage doesn't advance this State interest in regulating procreation. Let's just assume for the moment that that's so. Obviously, same-sex partners cannot procreate themselves. But is there -- in addition to that, are you saying that recognizing same-sex marriage will impinge upon that State interest, will harm that State interest in regulating procreation through marriage? Yes, but I don't think that -- -- that's right, Mr. Bursch. I don't think that that's right. I think before something as fundamental to a society and to individuals as marriage, before an exclusion of this kind can be made in that institution, the State needs some reason for that exclusion. And I've given you an -- a real opportunity to tell me what that reason is. What is the reason for the exclusion rather than the reason for the noninclusion? But do you think -- do you think that that's what it would do, Mr. Bursch, that if one allowed same-sex marriage, one would be announcing to the world that marriage and children have nothing to do with each other? Well, not in the abstract, not in the concrete. But I do think, Mr. Bursch -- Mr Bursch, suppose -- suppose this: Suppose that there's a State with a very procreation-centered view of marriage of the kind that you're talking about. And it -- you know, so emotional commitment and support, all of these, the State thinks are not the purpose of marriage and they want their marriage licenses to be addressed only to the things which serve this procreation purpose. And so they say, Well, we're not giving marriage licenses to any -- to anybody who doesn't want children. So when people come in and ask for a marriage license, they just ask a simple question: Do you want children? And if the answer is no, the State says, no marriage license for you. Would that be constitutional? No, the State has -- the State has this -- it's not a perfect correlation, but the State says that the best -- the best way to promote this procreation-centered view of marriage is just to limit marriage to people who want children. So that's what it does. Would that be constitutional? No, but this State -- What you said -- To ask if you want children is an unconstitutional invasion of privacy? No, but you're -- but you're the one who said that rational basis, pure rational basis, applies. And this is a State -- -- that's decided that it so wants this procreation-centered view of marriage, that it's going to exclude people who don't want children. It's going to exclude people who can't have children. And the question is, would that be constitutional? And it seems to me it flows directly from your argument that it would be constitutional. But the problem is that we hear about those kinds of restrictions, and every single one of us said that can't be constitutional. And I'm suggesting that the same might be true here. To keep the marriage definition as -- as you have described it as so procreation-centered, that a State can exclude everybody that does not serve that purpose for that reason alone. And that's the reason you've given. Well, you see, this is what I think is -- is difficult for some people with your argument, is that it's hard to see how permitting same-sex marriage discourages people from being bonded with their biological children. So if you would explain that to me. But, you know, they are connected, right? Because if you think about -- If you think about the potential -- who are the potential adoptive parents, many of them are same-sex parents who can't have their own children, and truly want to experience exactly the kind of bond that you're talking about. So how does it make those children better off by preventing that from happening? Yes. But you, yourself, are saying that the marriage -- the -- the recognition of marriage helps the children, aren't you? I mean, you'd rather have -- the whole basis of your argument is that you want children in marital households. More -- more adopted children and more marital households, whether same sex or other sex seems to be a good thing. Well, I'm just asking based on your policy how it's not a good thing. I'm not trying to put words in your mouth. I'm just saying if -- if -- it just seems to me inexplicable given what you've said are your policy interests. Of course -- I mean, of course, Mr. Bursch, we don't live in a pure democracy; we live in a constitutional democracy. And the constitutional -- the Constitution imposes limits on what people can do and this is one of those cases -- we see them every day -- where we have to decide what those limits are or whether the Constitution speaks to something and prevents the democratic processes from operating purely independently; isn't that right? No, but that's the question, is whether there are these equality limits or whether there are these liberty limits. So let's go back to the liberty limits that you were just talking about. Now, the right to marry. We've had -- we had Loving. We had Zablocki. We had Turner. In all of these cases what we've talked about is a right to marry. We didn't try to define the right more particularly: Is there a right to interracial marriage? Is there a right to marry if you're a prisoner? We just said there's a right to marry, that is fundamental and that everybody is entitled to it unless there's some good reason for the State to exclude it -- exclude them. So why shouldn't we adopt the exact same understanding here? Well, they were dealing then with men and women coming together, but the question was, well, there might be a black woman and a -- and a black man or a white woman or a black woman and a white man and -- and there was no inquiry into whether that was a traditional form of marriage. If there had been such an inquiry in this country, they would have come up pretty short. Historically, it was not a part of the tradition, that's right. And the Court said -- -- irrelevant that that's not a part of the tradition because -- -- because there's no good reason for it not to be part of the next tradition. But Loving was very clearly -- Loving was very clearly not just a racial case, that -- it also was a -- a liberty case? And indeed, Loving was exactly what this case is. It's a case which shows how liberty and -- and equality are intertwined, wasn't it? See, to me it seems as though you are doing something very different that we've never done before, which is you are defining constitutional rights in terms of the kinds of people that can exercise them. And I don't think we've really ever done that. Where we've seen a constitutional right, we have not defined it by these people can exercise it, but these people can't, especially in a case where the claims are both rights-based and equality-based. I mean, it would be like saying in Lawrence, well, there's only a right to intimate activity for heterosexual people and not a right to intimate sexual activity for gays and lesbians. And, of course, we didn't do that. Once we understood that there was a right to engage in intimate activity, it was a right for everybody. Well, it must be -- It must be -- But that's why you're drawing distinctions based on sexual orientation in these laws. I'm not asking about -- I'm not asking about your reasons and whether you have any or not. But whether you have any or not, you are drawing distinctions based on sexual orientation. That's what -- that's what these laws do. What did -- what did we say in Bray? Something about if you prevent people from wearing yarmulkes, you know that it's discrimination against Jews. Isn't that what we said in Bray? Same thing here. Sorry, the case that I'm talking about said what I said. Mr. Whalen, just a quick question. You -- you acknowledge that if the State loses on the first question, then the State also loses on the second question? It's a fortiori? That's -- Okay. ",ms bonauto maybe I be just not understanding justice scalia s question but for example there be many rabbi that will not conduct marriage between jew and non jew notwithstanding that we have a constitutional prohibition against religious discrimination and those rabbis get all the power and privilege of the state even if they have that rule most many many many rabbi will not do that mr

2014,Rodriguez v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"Can I just-- --Could I just get a little clarification on your argument? If I understand what you've been saying, you are accepting the idea, aren't you, that the dog sniff is something that's extraneous to the mission of the stop; is that correct? It's not an ordinary incident. Wait, I'm not getting there yet. I just want to understand -- because that's not what the questions are focused on, like, what is a stop? What's the mission of the stop? What's entailed in a normal stop? And you're not contesting that a dog sniff is not something that's entailed in a normal stop even though there might be occasions where you can do a dog sniff attendant to a stop. Ms. Anders -- I'm sorry. Please. You know, I -- I think I read Caballes differently than you. Here's what I think agrees with you on and here's what I think Caballes doesn't. Caballes definitely agrees with you on that a dog sniff is not part of the traffic stop. So I think that you and Caballes are definitely in the same place there. And Caballes definitely says that even though a dog sniff is not part of the mission of the traffic stop, we're going to allow a dog sniff if the dog sniff doesn't extend the traffic stop. It's like, you know, there are two officers or there's some other reason why you're not being detained a moment longer because of the dog sniff and Caballes basically says, sure, no harm, no foul on that one, right? But then you're saying Caballes gives you this extra leeway to detain people even though it is longer than an ordinary traffic stop would take, and I think that's just not right. I mean, I think that reasonableness language in Caballes is all about -- it's an extra limitation the Court says. It says, like, don't think just because this officer was really slow and it took a really long time to do the traffic stop, and he was able because of that to get another officer in and do a dog sniff and it was all with -- it's like an additional limitation that, no, you have to be diligent and you have to be reasonable in the way you conduct the traffic stop. And if you're not, the dog sniff can't come in even though it was conducted during the time the traffic stop occurred. But it -- that's -- that's an additional constraint. It's not some kind of extra leeway for the police officers to do things outside the bounds of the traffic stop itself. It is not a search, but the -- but the theory of Caballes and of all of our questions is that you can't -- and of all of our cases -- is that you really can't detain somebody if you don't have some kind of objective reasonable basis for doing so. And that any detention -- and, you know, it might be ten minutes or it might be five minutes or it might be two minutes -- without that kind of basis is a Fourth Amendment violation. Suppose, Ms. Anders, that -- it's a hypothetical -- police pulls somebody over and starts the process and then the police officer says, you know, I'd like a cigarette break now? A cigarette probably takes about as long as the dog sniff took in this -- and just, you know, smokes a cigarette and he goes back to work. All right? Would you say that that was unconstitutional prolongation of the stop. Okay. So it would become unreasonable because there he was, he wasn't doing anything related to the mission of the stop. That's true if he gave the ticket and then said, I want you to stay while I take a cigarette break, or it's true if he did it before he gave the ticket, either way. I guess what I'm saying to you is I kind of think it's the same thing, is that once you've acknowledge that the dog sniff is something that's extraneous to the stop itself -- it's obviously more helpful to the police than a cigarette break -- but it's extraneous to the stop itself -- then the same rules apply as if the police officer had just taken a moratorium on the stop in the middle in order to conduct his own business. But then you really are saying because we have a reason to pull you over for a traffic stop, that gives us some extra time to start questioning you about other law enforcement-related things and to do other law enforcement-related business. And I never thought that that was the rule. I always thought is that once the objective basis -- you know, for the stop, dissipated, that was it. But what your -- where your rule is going to lead to, Ms. Anders, is something along the lines of, like, everybody will decide 30 minutes or 40 minutes, I think you say at one point in your brief, is reasonable for a traffic stop. And if you see a taillight violation, that's 40 minutes of free time for the police officers to investigate any crimes that they want, because they can do it all in the range of what you've decided is kind of the reasonable traffic stop.

If we could start all over again, forget all the history that you just said, if we could start all over again, you, I think, just agreed that we would use ordinary contract principles; is that right? Okay. So ordinary contract principles, we would -- first, we would look at the agreement, and if the agreement said something clearly either way, whether it was for vesting or against vesting, the agreement would control; is that correct? And if the agreement was ambiguous, we could take extrinsic evidence to clarify the terms of the agreement; is that correct? Okay, so-- --Custom, practice. Yes, I hear you. Yes, I hear you. I was not getting you to agree with YardMan and I was not getting you to agree to the Sixth Circuit. Yes. But what -- what I want to -- is you look at the text, if the text says it either way, you go with the text; if the text doesn't say it either way, it's permissible to look at extrinsic evidence, like, the practice of the parties and, you know, what you sold this for and things like that. Well, but then you get to Justice Ginsburg's question, don't you, which is that this is a case where actually the parties are disputing language. It's not really a case where there is silence. I mean, you've come in and you've given some language that's very good for your side, which is that duration clause, and the other party has come in and focused on the word “ receiving ” and focused on the tying arrangement between this and pensions, and focused on the surviving spouse clause. So you have -- you have some language, they have some language. Ms. Ho, Congress has said, yes, in pension benefits, there's vesting. And in health care benefits we leave it to the parties; is that right? So it doesn't have any implication for health care benefits other than we leave it to the parties, isn't that right? Well, but then you're back to your first background rule, which is that we would expect to see this if it were there. But you can -- I mean, that seems that statement has its corollary, right? Which is that, you know, either party -- we would expect, we would expect to see if the union had won, that it would say vested. We would expect to see if the employer had won, it would say unvested. And, indeed, I think that there's an amicus brief in this case that suggests that there was a survey done of all these agreements and about 60 percent of them say quite explicitly unvested. Yours doesn't do that. So there we are. We're left with this ambiguity, and you have some language and they have some language and some judge has to figure it out. Congress has said we don't care. Congress has said we leave it to them. Please. And is it right that Petitioners' original arguments were not that they didn't have to pay these at all, but only that these benefits were capped at a certain level; is that right? So is this the language you're referring to, ""Exceptions are determined by contract interpretation, rights which accrued or vested under the agreement will, as a general rule, survive termination of the agreement? "" Go back to something that you said earlier that I wasn't sure I understood from reading the briefs. You said that this was a standard form contract that arose in Ohio for rubber companies; is that right? And did these contracts arise before or after YardMan?

2014,King v. Burwell,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Carvin. Mr. Carvin. Can -- can I offer you a sort of simple daily life kind of example which I think is linguistically equivalent to what the sections here say that Justice Breyer was talking about? So I have three clerks, Mr. Carvin. Their names are Will and Elizabeth and Amanda. Okay? So my first clerk, I say, Will, I'd like you to write me a memo. And I say, Elizabeth, I want you to edit Will's memo once he's done. And then I say, Amanda, listen, if Will is too busy to write the memo, I want you to write such memo. Now, my question is: If Will is too busy to write the memo and Amanda has to write such memo, should Elizabeth edit the memo? (Laughter.) Gosh -- -- you -- you run a different shop than I do if that's the way -- (Laughter.) Because in my chambers, if Elizabeth did not edit the memo, Elizabeth would not be performing her function. In other words, there's a -- a substitute, and I've set up a substitute. And then I've given -- I've given instructions: Elizabeth, you write -- you edit Will's memo, but of course if Amanda writes the memo, the instructions carry over. Elizabeth knows what she's supposed to do. She's supposed to edit Amanda's memo, too. He's good, Justice Alito. Ah, but that's -- Yes. That's a very important point, I think, because what you're saying is that the answer to the question really does depend on context, and it depends on an understanding of the law as a whole and whether they were agnostic. I agree with that. So it's not the simple four or five words because the four or five words in my example, it's obvious that Elizabeth should edit the memo. It's the whole structure and context of the provision that suggests whether those instructions carry over to the substitute, isn't it? That's not -- Mr. Carvin, that's not -- that's not what you said previously when you were here last time in this never-ending saga. (Laughter.) You said the -- you said without the subsidies driving demand within the Exchanges, insurance companies would have absolutely no reason to offer their products through Exchanges. And then you said the insurance Exchanges cannot operate as intended by Congress absent the subsidies. I don't know think that's quite right, Mr. Carvin. I mean -- I'm sorry, Mr. Carvin. Please. Well, then, I'll ask a question. (Laughter.) No. I mean, let's go back to this question of where -- where Congress put this thing because putting aside constitutional issues, I mean, there's at least a presumption, as we interpret statutes, that Congress does not mean to impose heavy burdens and Draconian choices on States unless it says so awfully clearly. And here -- and this goes back to what Justice Ginsburg was saying -- there's really nothing clear about this. I mean, this took a year and a half for anybody to even notice this language. And as Justice Ginsburg said, it's -- it's put in not in the place that you would expect it to be put in, which is where it says to the -- the States, here is the choice you have. It's not even put in where the statute defines who a qualified individual is or who is entitled to get the subsidies. Rather, it comes in in this technical formula that's directed to the Department of the Treasury saying how much the amount of the subsidy should be. And that seems to be -- it both makes no sense from Congress's point of view, and in terms of our own point of view, in terms of interpreting statutes, that's not the clarity with which we require the government to speak when it's upsetting Federal-State relations like this. The -- I think not, Mr. Carvin. I mean, I think the place I would look to find out about my choices is in the provision of the statute that talks about my choices. I think the last place I would look is a provision of the statute that talks about -- what is it -- coverage months for purposes of this subsection, which, by the way, isn't even the right subsection, but whatever. That -- that's where I would look, is in -- is in where it talks about what a coverage month is? As I understand it -- Wow. You've been talking a long time. You have two more sentences. Those were two long sentences -- I think -- I think -- Yes. I -- I think I'm right that Justice Breyer's question about anomalies, which are replete in the Act, under your interpretation, did not talk about what I think is one of the most glaring ones, which is this qualified individualist thing, that you're essentially setting up a system in which these Federal Exchanges, that there will be no customers and, in fact, there will be no products, because Section 1311 says that the Exchange shall make health plans available to qualified individuals, and then the next section says that qualified individual means an individual who resides in the State that established the Exchange. So under your theory, if Federal Exchanges don't qualify as Exchanges established by the State, that means Federal Exchanges have no customers. Well, that's -- that's because they don't share your theory. Under your theory -- -- that's the result. Ah, but look at the -- look at the prisoner provision, which says prisoners shouldn't be treated as qualified individuals. So under your theory, this statute effectively said that prisoners should be able to enroll on Federal Exchanges? That makes no sense. But we are interpreting a statute generally to make it make sense as a whole, right? We look at the whole text. We don't look at four words. We look at the whole text, the particular context, the more general context, try to make everything harmonious with everything else. I think you said, even at the very beginning of this argument as we were going back and forth about my hypothetical, that, of course, context matters and context might make all the difference with respect to what those five words mean. And I think what we're suggesting is that, if you look at the entire text, it's pretty clear that you oughtn't to treat those five words in the way you are.

2014,United States v. Kwai Fun Wong,114,Elena Kagan,"But, Mr. Martinez, wouldn't that argument suggest that Irwin was really only good as to new statutes? As to statutes that were passed after Irwin? But, you see, I would -- I guess I would have thought that really anything pre-Irwin, the government could stand up and make a very, very similar argument, which is, you know, in this world we actually thought that a statute of limitations with respect to a suit against a government was jurisdictional, did not include equitable tolling, that there were really no decisions the other way, that Congress thought of that as the background rule. And so what's to prevent this case from essentially becoming everything prior to 1990 is presumed to be jurisdictional contra Irwin? I take it that your argument would apply not only to 2401(b), but also to 2401(a)? But it's the same language. And if I understood the argument you're -- you're making, it's -- your essential argument is this incorporated the Tucker language, Congress knew what the Tucker language meant, therefore, Congress understood these to be jurisdictional as well. I meant, I have to think that this is just all over the U.S. Code, this kind of language. There's nothing unusual about this language “ shall be barred ”. This is kind of the classic language, right? It sounds to me like, the way you're going about this inquiry, we're going to have to take a case on every statute of limitations in -- in the U.S. Code. Because you're saying, well, this is similar enough and maybe this would be a little bit different, it has a few fewer words, and then we have to look at the history, and we have to stare at the drafting concerns of Congress. And I thought that Irwin was supposed to take us away from all that. Sure. But there are two kinds of ways that you can rebut something. One is by saying, here's something very distinctive about this statute that shows that Congress meant for it to be jurisdictional, that shows that Congress didn't mean for equitable tolling to apply. But that's not the kind of argument you are making here. You're making an argument that basically says in this pre-Irwin world, Congress understood that when it came to statutes against the government, they would be jurisdictional and equitable tolling would not apply, see the Tucker Act. And that could be said, I think, for every statute with respect to suits against the government prior to Irwin. I'm sorry, which language are you talking about? I mean, “ shall be forever barred ” seems, to me, to be the most important part of that language. Is there anything else you would say to Justice Scalia is it's just ""shall be forever barred"" plus a few more words? Anything else?

2014,Mellouli v. Lynch,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Laramore-- --that one way of looking at it, but might I suggest that you gave in a little bit too fast to Justice Alito that the phrase “ relating to a controlled substance ” has to modify “ law ”. It's -- it's very true that usually in grammar a phrase like that would modify the last noun-- --which this case is “ law ”. There is another noun in this sentence, which is “ violation ”. And can I suggest to you that maybe, if you read this entire provision, it's pretty clearly talking about violation, because here is the way it reads. It's -- ""convicted of a violation of any law relating to a controlled substance other than a marijuana offense. "" “ Other than a marijuana offense ”. Now, it just doesn't make any sense to say, a law relating to a controlled substance other than a marijuana offense. What makes sense is to say, a violation of law-- --other than a marijuana offense. So this last phrase, “ other than a marijuana offense ”, which is an exception and so you say what's it an exception to? The offense is an exception to the violation. So the violation is the key word doing the work in this phrase. Yes. It's not the conduct. I think you misspoke when you said that. It's -- the violation is the crime of conviction. How about half and half? But if I understand the way the law works, right, Ms. Kovner, that's -- that is true of paraphernalia drugs, that they're indivisible with respect to the controlled substance. It's not true with respect to most possession statutes or distribution statutes or so forth. And the reason that there is that distinction is because paraphernalia offenses are generally extremely minor offenses; they're not felonies. They're just, as in this case, they're misdemeanors that are meant to catch leftover things that, you know, prosecutors plead to when they don't really want to charge a more serious offense. And so it makes good sense that all of these paraphernalia offenses would be counted out by this approach. You're counting out a bunch of trivial -- I mean, you know, “ trivial ”, I don't want to say trivial -- minor offenses. But -- but as Ms. -- as Justice Sotomayor suggested, it's a significant practical problem that's implicated in the current practice of the BIA. It at least might be implicated in the current practice of the BIA. But, Ms. Kovner, I would think that the history works against you in the following way: Because the prior statute here was a statute that listed all these Federally controlled substances. And that eventually got to be impractical, there were too many of them, they kept changing and so Congress went to this approach. But it was clear in the old statute that the only way that you could be held deportable was if you had been convicted of an offense, you know, possession or distribution or whatever, with a Federally controlled substance. And there's no reason to think that in enacting this statute that -- that Congress meant to do something broader than that. There's every reason to think it wanted to do the exact same thing. If you're convicted of a controlled substance -- of possession of a controlled substance, you are deportable. If you're not, if it's only Sudafed, you're not. No. But the question is, when Congress makes a change like that, which we know is a change for a particular reason because the list of substances was getting out of control -- it's very much like yesterday's case; I don't know if you're familiar with that -- but Congress makes a change for one reason, suggests -- does not make any -- any suggestion that this change is supposed to do something else and something much bigger, which is extend this deportability provision to controlled substances that aren't part of the Federal list, and there's just no reason to think that Congress did that in making this change. If he had cocaine in his sock, he would probably be convicted of possession of cocaine. He was convicted of paraphernalia here because he had four pills of Adderall, which if you go to half the colleges in America, people you know, and just randomly pick somebody, there would be a decent chance-- [Laughter] ",mr laramore that one way of look at it but might i suggest that you give in a little bit too fast to justice alito that the phrase relating to a control substance have to modify law it be it be very true that usually in grammar a phrase like that would modify the last noun which this case be law there be another noun in this sentence which be violation and can i suggest to you that maybe if you read this entire provision it be pretty clearly talk about violation because here be the way it read it be convict of a violation of any law relating to a control substance other than a marijuana offense other than a marijuana offense now it just do not make any sense to say a law relate to a control substance other than a marijuana offense what make sense be to say a violation of law other than a marijuana offense so this last phrase other than a marijuana offense which be an exception and so you say what be it an exception to the offense be an exception to the violation so the violation be the key word do the work in this phrase yes it be not the conduct i think you misspoke when you say that it be the violation be the crime of conviction how about half and half but if i understand the way the law work right ms kovner that be that be true of paraphernalia drug that they be indivisible with respect to the control substance it be not true with respect to most possession statute or distribution statute or so forth and the reason that there be that distinction be because paraphernalia offense be generally extremely minor offense they be not felony they be just as in this case they be misdemeanor that be mean to catch leftover thing that you know prosecutor plead to when they do not really want to charge a more serious offense and so it make good sense that all of these paraphernalia offense would be count out by this approach you be count out a bunch of trivial i mean you know trivial i do not want to say trivial minor offense but but as ms as justice sotomayor suggest it be a significant practical problem that be implicate in the current practice of the bia it at least might be implicate in the current practice of the bia but ms kovner i would think that the history work against you in the following way because the prior statute here be a statute that list all these federally control substance and that eventually get to be impractical there we be too many of them they keep change and so congress go to this approach but it be clear in the old statute that the only way that you could be hold deportable be if you have be convict of an offense you know possession or distribution or whatever with a federally control substance and there be no reason to think that in enact this statute that that congress mean to do something broad than that there be every reason to think it want to do the exact same thing if you be convict of a controlled substance of possession of a controlled substance you be deportable if you be not if it be only sudafed you be not no but the question be when congress make a change like that which we know be a change for a particular reason because the list of substance be get out of control it be very much like yesterday s case i do not know if you be familiar with that but congress make a change for one reason suggest do not make any any suggestion that this change be suppose to do something else and something much big which be extend this deportability provision to control substance that be not part of the federal list and there be just no reason to think that congress do that in make this change if he have cocaine in his sock he would probably be convict of possession of cocaine he be convict of paraphernalia here because he have four pill of adderall which if you go to half the college in america people you know and just randomly pick somebody there would be a decent chance laughter ,247.14,Roberts Court,"Jan 14, 2015",Moones Mellouli,"Loretta Lynch, Attorney General",13-1034,"Jun 30, 2014","Jun 1, 2015",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2015,"Kingdomware Technologies, Inc. v. United States",114,Elena Kagan,"How is it apparent that a particular veteran's business can perform a particular contract? I mean, what in the database shows you, yes, this veteran's small business is capable of performing this contract in a reasonably effective way? Well, what Justice -- what -- Justice Breyer raised a question about the way this statute is worded because it says, ""For purposes of meeting the goals."" And the goals are very low; the goals are 3 percent. So it seems odd for a statute to say for persons of meeting a 3-percent goal, you should do the following, which will lead to 90 percent. How high? That could be four percent. No, it sounds like the government did very badly in meeting its goals. And you can understand why Congress would have done something to say the government -- and specifically the VA -- has to do a lot better toward meeting its goals. But the goals are still, you know, pretty far down compared to what Justice Breyer was indicating is the natural tendency of this system that you're describing to produce -- you know, almost everything is given to a veteran. Mr. Tripp, I guess I'm not sure I understand. I mean, I understand your policy concerns and -- and the way you think this will damage procurement practices. But the statute just seems pretty clear. Once you say that this is a contract, what you've said in your brief and right now. And once you say that, it just -- the statute says, ""A contracting officer of the department shall award contracts on the basis of competition restricted to veterans' small businesses."" So that seems to kind of answer the case, whatever the policy identifications are. Well, it's your own understanding of contract. You just said this is -- -- contract. But as I understand it, all of those contracts have a ""may"" in there. Or almost all of them do. Yeah, but -- but most of them have a ""may."" But here you have -- and -- and the ""shall""s, the one or two that there are, have really never been adjudicated by -- certainly by this Court. So the question is, well, there we are. We are, you know, for the first time deciding what this language means, and this language means that you shall award contracts on the basis of this restricted competition. And you say this is a contract, so you know, end of case. One of the amicus briefs suggests that the VA is now doing increasingly complex procurements by way of the FSS. That we have it in our heads that this is all about, you know, staples and paperclips, but that, in fact, the FSS is being used to do things that would previously have been done on the open market. Mr. Tripp, can -- can I ask, what effect would this statute really have on your view? As I understand it, the government does have to use the Rule of Two on all open-market purchases; is that right? Above, like, a very low threshold? Is it 3,500, something like that? So -- so if you're right, what did this statute actually accomplish? In other words, you already have to use the Rule of Two for open-market purchases, or almost all of them. What does the statute do? What are the kinds of things that aren't done under the FSS? Like, what's the remaining 80? ",how be it apparent that a particular veteran s business can perform a particular contract i mean what in the database show you yes this veteran s small business be capable of perform this contract in a reasonably effective way well what justice what justice breyer raise a question about the way this statute be word because it say for purpose of meet the goal and the goal be very low the goal be percent so it seem odd for a statute to say for person of meet a percent goal you should do the following which will lead to percent how high that could be four percent no it sound like the government do very badly in meet its goal and you can understand why congress would have do something to say the government and specifically the va have to do a lot well toward meet its goal but the goal be still you know pretty far down compare to what justice breyer be indicate be the natural tendency of this system that you be describe to produce you know almost everything be give to a veteran mr tripp i guess I be not sure i understand i mean i understand your policy concern and and the way you think this will damage procurement practice but the statute just seem pretty clear once you say that this be a contract what you have say in your brief and right now and once you say that it just the statute say a contracting officer of the department shall award contract on the basis of competition restrict to veteran small business so that seem to kind of answer the case whatever the policy identification be well it be your own understanding of contract you just say this be contract but as i understand it all of those contract have a may in there or almost all of them do yeah but but most of them have a may but here you have and and the shall s the one or two that there be have really never be adjudicate by certainly by this court so the question be well there we be we be you know for the first time decide what this language mean and this language mean that you shall award contract on the basis of this restrict competition and you say this be a contract so you know end of case one of the amicus brief suggest that the va be now do increasingly complex procurement by way of the f that we have it in our head that this be all about you know staple and paperclip but that in fact the f be be use to do thing that would previously have be do on the open market mr tripp can can i ask what effect would this statute really have on your view as i understand it the government do have to use the rule of two on all open market purchase be that right above like a very low threshold be it something like that so so if you be right what do this statute actually accomplish in other word you already have to use the rule of two for open market purchase or almost all of them what do the statute do what be the kind of thing that be not do under the f like what be the remain ,187.56,Roberts Court,"Feb 22, 2016","Kingdomware Technologies, Inc.",United States,14-916,"Jun 22, 2015","Jun 16, 2016",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2015,McDonnell v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Francisco, could I ask -- the line you're drawing between exercising influence and providing access, just to sort of test that with a hypothetical, suppose that somebody knew that there was a -- a contractor who was going to award a very large contract to one of two or three firms that the -- that he was meeting with. And -- and a company paid to make sure that they were on the meet list, to be one of those two or three firms, in other words, bribed -- -- an official in order to become one of those two or three firms from which that was the pool from which -- -- this billion-dollar contract would emerge, would that be sufficient? Can I -- Well, can I follow up on that? Because what you just suggested, right, is that you could -- suppose that there were a scheduler for a Governor or for the President or whatever, and that scheduler was selling meetings. So you would think that's part of her job? And if I just understood you correctly, that falls within the statute? Mr. -- Can I -- Can I ask -- Mr. Francisco -- -- if -- you said something before, and I might have misunderstood you. But do you think that -- of the five listed ""official acts,"" do you think none of them meet the standards that you're suggesting, or do you think some of them do and some of them don't? Okay. So let me -- Go ahead, please. Okay. That -- that might be right. It might be that -- that you still have a -- a winning argument even if some of the five are fine. But -- but if we could just focus on them for a bit. I mean, for example, the third one -- The 6091. Contacting other officials to influence Virginia State researchers to initiate clinical studies. So that's the one that seems to me to really fall within your own definition. Do you disagree with that? So on something like that, your argument is a sufficiency argument? Rather than this was -- this is not an ""official act""? If it's true, but -- Can I ask you a narrower question, Mr. Dreeben? So one of the ""official acts"" here -- I'll just read it to you. It's allowing Jonnie Williams to invite individuals important to Star Scientific's business to exclusive events at the Governor's Mansion. So that's essentially hosting a party and allowing Mr. Williams to invite some people. And why does that -- why is that an ""official act,"" in your view? So here's, I guess -- I mean, I guess, my question is this: The -- the ""official act,"" the statute, the definition, I mean, requires that there be some particular matter, cause, suit, proceeding, or controversy, correct? And if I understand the theory of this case, the matter, suit, cause, proceeding, or controversy here is the attempt to get the University of Virginia to do clinical studies of this product; is that correct? That's the gravamen of the thing? So if you had just -- if -- if the indictment, and then the instructions that were based on the indictment, had said the ""official act"" is getting the University of Virginia to do clinical studies, right, that reads very differently from the way this indictment was structured. Because what this indictment does is it takes a lot of different pieces of evidence that might relate to that ""official act"" and charges them as ""official acts"" themselves, so that the party becomes an ""official act"" or calling somebody just to talk about the product becomes an ""official act."" Do you see what I mean? I mean, you know, this might have been perfectly chargeable and instructable, but I guess I'm -- I'm troubled by these particular charges and instructions, which seems to make every piece of evidence that you had an ""official act,"" rather than just saying the ""official act"" was the -- was the attempt to get the University of Virginia to do something that they wouldn't have done otherwise. Well, what would -- Mr. Francisco, just take Mr. Dreeben's own example, which is the example of somebody -- he's running a business, and he's taking $5,000 at a pop every time he arranges a meeting with the criminal division for somebody.

2015,Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Rosenkranz, just to continue on with what Justice Ginsburg was asking you. As an ex-post matter, you have a great David versus Goliath story to tell. But as an ex-ante matter, I wonder if the rule that you suggest is not going to harm the Kirtsaengs of the world. And you know, you might take these couple things into account: That the Kirtsaengs of the world will probably think that the -- that they are spending less on their lawyers than the John Wileys of the world. And that they're also more risk averse, because they have less money. So, you know, given those two factors, doesn't your rule, actually as an ex-ante matter, cut against the Kirtsaengs of the world? Well, but that's only one side of the question. I mean, what you're doing is you're upping the stakes generally so that Kirtsaeng is going to know, well, it's true I might be able to get my fees back; but at the same time, I run the risk of having to pay John Wiley's fees. And John Wiley, as I said, is probably going to be paying its lawyers more than I'm going to be paying mine. And I'm very risk-sensitive as a Kirtsaeng type. So that's a huge deal for me to increase my stakes that much. So one thing that concerns me about a test like that, Mr. Rosenkranz, is it's very hard for people to make judgments ex ante and to figure out what their chances are. It's very hard to predict. And if you're concerned about the Kirtsaengs of the world, the Davids in these kinds of suits, what you might want is a pretty clear safe harbor. In other words, if I'm taking a reasonable position, I'm not going to be stuck with the other side's fees, which are likely to dwarf my own. And that's something that somebody can predict, as opposed to this 22-factor test, which it's like I just don't know how this is going to come out, and I might well be stuck with John Wiley's fees, depending on what judge I draw and, oh, a number of other things that I don't have any control over. Can I -- can I ask, Mr. Rosenkranz, one of the things that confused me about this case and about, actually, both sides' arguments, I -- I don't really understand why it is that the fees are awarded in such a high percentage of the cases, both in the Second Circuit and elsewhere. I mean, the Second Circuit says that its -- the first-among-equal factors is the reasonableness, but it awards fees in more -- way more than half the cases. Is it that so many of the cases are utterly frivolous? Before -- before you talk to me about the -- the way this might or might not be pro-plaintiff or pro-defendant, just why are they all so high? Mr. Smith, when you have a -- a system, which the Second Circuit does, of saying, look, this is the first among equal factors, and you need something, you know, pretty exceptional to outweigh this factor, if I'm a district judge and I'm thinking, you know, who likes to be overruled by the Second Circuit, it does seem as though it sends a pretty strong signal to district courts that this is the key factor and that they are not -- you know, probably not in their lifetimes going to see a case in which that factor is outweighed. Do you have a view, Mr. Smith, as to why it is that this reasonableness inquiry is producing such skewed results as to plaintiffs and defendants? Because as a logical matter, you would think it shouldn't, that -- that there -- there wouldn't be this skew. Unless you really think the defendants are taking so many more unreasonable litigating positions. And I -- I guess that could be. But is there any other explanation or any, you know, thoughts you have about that? Mr. Smith suggested that he thought the times in which the reasonableness inquiry would be outweighed is if you see real litigation misconduct. Is that your sense too, or is there anything else that actually is capable of outweighing it? If you were thinking of this solely as a policy matter, if you didn't think that that evidence was all that overwhelming, why is it that this factor should be first among equals? ",mr rosenkranz just to continue on with what justice ginsburg be ask you as an ex post matter you have a great david versus goliath story to tell but as an ex ante matter i wonder if the rule that you suggest be not go to harm the kirtsaengs of the world and you know you might take these couple thing into account that the kirtsaengs of the world will probably think that the that they be spend less on their lawyer than the john wileys of the world and that they be also more risk averse because they have less money so you know give those two factor do not your rule actually as an ex ante matter cut against the kirtsaengs of the world well but that be only one side of the question i mean what you be do be you be up the stake generally so that kirtsaeng be go to know well it be true i might be able to get my fee back but at the same time i run the risk of have to pay john wiley s fee and john wiley as i say be probably go to be pay its lawyer more than I be go to be pay mine and I be very risk sensitive as a kirtsaeng type so that be a huge deal for me to increase my stake that much so one thing that concern me about a test like that mr rosenkranz be it be very hard for people to make judgment ex ante and to figure out what their chance be it be very hard to predict and if you be concern about the kirtsaengs of the world the david in these kind of suit what you might want be a pretty clear safe harbor in other word if I be take a reasonable position I be not go to be stick with the other side s fee which be likely to dwarf my own and that be something that somebody can predict as oppose to this factor test which it be like i just do not know how this be go to come out and i might well be stick with john wiley s fee depend on what judge i draw and oh a number of other thing that i do not have any control over can i can i ask mr rosenkranz one of the thing that confuse me about this case and about actually both side argument i i do not really understand why it be that the fee be award in such a high percentage of the case both in the second circuit and elsewhere i mean the second circuit say that its the first among equal factor be the reasonableness but it award fee in more way more than half the case be it that so many of the case be utterly frivolous before before you talk to me about the the way this might or might not be pro plaintiff or pro defendant just why be they all so high mr smith when you have a a system which the second circuit do of say look this be the first among equal factor and you need something you know pretty exceptional to outweigh this factor if I be a district judge and I be think you know who like to be overrule by the second circuit it do seem as though it send a pretty strong signal to district court that this be the key factor and that they be not you know probably not in their lifetime go to see a case in which that factor be outweigh do you have a view mr smith as to why it be that this reasonableness inquiry be produce such skewed result as to plaintiff and defendant because as a logical matter you would think it should not that that there there would not be this skew unless you really think the defendant be take so many more unreasonable litigating position and i i guess that could be but be there any other explanation or any you know thought you have about that mr smith suggest that he think the time in which the reasonableness inquiry would be outweigh be if you see real litigation misconduct be that your sense too or be there anything else that actually be capable of outweigh it if you we be think of this solely as a policy matter if you do not think that that evidence be all that overwhelm why be it that this factor should be first among equal ,254.86,Roberts Court,"Apr 25, 2016",Supap Kirtsaeng,"John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",15-375,"Jan 15, 2016","Jun 16, 2016",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2015,Hurst v. Florida,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Waxman, can I give you a hypothetical State system? And this is a two-part question. You tell me if it is consistent with the Sixth Amendment. And if it is, what makes this case different. Okay? So my system is that a jury, whether in the penalty phase or in the guilt phase, has to make a determination of an aggravating factor. Okay. But once that's done, once the jury decides on an aggravating factor, the judge can do whatever she wants. The judge can add aggravating factors. The judge can reweigh the aggravating factors as compared with the mitigating evidence. The judge can do any of that stuff. But the judge has to leave alone the aggravating factor that the jury finds. So, in other words, the judge can't give death when the jury finds life, and the judge can't throw out the jury's factor. But as long as that jury makes that aggravating factor, the judge can do anything that is consistent with the Sixth Amendment. Yes. Well, is that -- is that what makes a difference, then, in the end, that -- that you're saying that the jury has to be specifically told that that's what it's doing? That -- and you're saying -- -- the necessary part of a constitutional system for the jury to be instructed that it has the responsibility to find the aggravating factor that serves as a precondition to death. Well, you're saying it couldn't happen consistent with Ring, meaning that there are certain applications of the Florida law that would be unconstitutional even in your view. Could I give you another hypothetical scheme, notwithstanding that we don't sit in judgment of hypothetical schemes? Suppose that the -- the jury finds an aggravating fact, but then, you know, the judge has this whole separate hearing -- right? -- in which other things are presented to him. And the judge says, You know, I don't actually agree with the aggravating fact that the jury found, but I have my own aggravating facts, and now I'm -- I'm doing all the weighing and I come out in favor of death. I -- I assume that you would say that that also would be an unconstitutional application. Yes. Quite -- quite right. But I'm -- I'm hypothesizing a case in which the jury finds that death-eligibility marker. Right? If -- but the judge throws that one out and substitutes his own. That -- you think that would be constitutional? No, he does throw it out. He just says, I don't agree with that. I'm -- but I'm substituting my own. Would that be all right? But I have to say that answer surprises me because the death sentence there is not at all a function of the jury's eligibility finding. The judge has tossed out that eligibility finding and substituted his own, which then leads to the death sentence. So how can we say that that's possibly constitutional under Ring? The judge has said that that jury finding is utterly irrelevant to his decision about whether to impose death. That he's imposing death based on something that the jury has not found. But the thing is you can't really tell whether that happens in a wide variety of cases. And this is actually -- this goes to this question of because the jury doesn't actually have to find specific things, only the judge has to find specific things, you often are not going to be able to tell whether the judge's sentence is based on the same aggravating facts that the jury has found. Which honestly sounds the same. Can I go back to the kinds of hypotheticals that Justice Kennedy and I were -- were proposing. So let's say that there is a jury, and it's been presented with evidence that the murder was for pecuniary gain, which is one of the aggravating factors. And the -- the jury comes out with a recommendation of death. So you -- and that was the only thing that was presented to it. So you know that the jury has made a death eligibility determination on pecuniary gain. Then it goes to the judge. The judge says, you know what, I don't really think that there's enough evidence of pecuniary gain, but I've had this whole hearing, and I find that the thing was -- that the crime was heinous and whatnot, and now I'm going to sentence the person to death. Now, you say that that's fine; is that right? Well, no -- no -- he's -- he's heard more evidence because, you know, there's a whole new hearing that he has. And now he's considered it more thoroughly, and he thinks, no, I don't agree with that anymore, but I think it was heinous. So that would be fine. Yes, yes, yes, it's not this case. I'm throwing out -- -- the jury's aggravating factor, but I'm substituting my own. I thought that that was what you told me, that that was constitutional under Ring. This wasn't at the guilt phase; this was just as a matter of sentencing. Let me get on with my questioning -- -- because I think you answered this one already. Then the appeal that's taken, right -- the appeal is focusing now only on what the judge has found, isn't that right, under Florida law? The appeal -- if the person came in and said that there was insufficient evidence, the appeal would only be as to the judge's finding and not at all to the jury's. And -- and he says there was just not enough evidence of all these aggravating factors, so -- but that was -- would only be as to the judge's aggravating factors. It couldn't possibly be that he would challenge the jury's. I mean, I'm just suggesting that the whole appeal process suggests that the crucial death eligibility determination is being made by the judge because that's the only death eligibility determination that the appeals court is ever going to review. Yes, look, they have something to review. The problem is it's the judge's thing to -- that they're reviewing, not the jury's, and that's a Sixth Amendment problem. ",mr waxman can i give you a hypothetical state system and this be a two part question you tell me if it be consistent with the sixth amendment and if it be what make this case different okay so my system be that a jury whether in the penalty phase or in the guilt phase have to make a determination of an aggravating factor okay but once that be do once the jury decide on an aggravating factor the judge can do whatever she want the judge can add aggravating factor the judge can reweigh the aggravating factor as compare with the mitigate evidence the judge can do any of that stuff but the judge have to leave alone the aggravating factor that the jury find so in other word the judge can not give death when the jury find life and the judge can not throw out the jury s factor but as long as that jury make that aggravate factor the judge can do anything that be consistent with the sixth amendment yes well be that be that what make a difference then in the end that that you be say that the jury have to be specifically tell that that be what it be do that and you be say the necessary part of a constitutional system for the jury to be instruct that it have the responsibility to find the aggravating factor that serve as a precondition to death well you be say it could not happen consistent with ring mean that there be certain application of the florida law that would be

which honestly sound the same can i go back to the kind of hypothetical that justice kennedy and i we be we be propose so let us say that there be a jury and it be be present with evidence that the murder be for pecuniary gain which be one of the aggravating factor and the the jury come out with a recommendation of death so you and that be the only thing that be present to it so you know that the jury have make a death eligibility determination on pecuniary gain then it go to the judge the judge say you know what i do not really think that there be enough evidence of pecuniary gain but I have have this whole hearing and i find that the thing be that the crime be heinous and whatnot and now I be go to sentence the person to death now you say that that be fine be that right well no no he be he be heard more evidence because you know there be a whole new hearing that he have and now he be consider it more thoroughly and he think no i do not agree with that anymore but i think it be heinous so that would be fine yes yes yes it be not this case I be throw out the jury s aggravating factor but I be substitute my own i think that that be what you tell me that that be constitutional under ring this be not at the guilt phase this be just as a matter of sentence let me get on with my question because i think you answer this one already then the appeal that be take right the appeal be focus now only on what the judge have find be not that right under florida law the appeal if the person come in and say that there be insufficient evidence the appeal would only be as to the judge s finding and not at all to the jury s and and he say there be just not enough evidence of all these aggravate factor so but that be would only be as to the judge s aggravating factor it could not possibly be that he would challenge the jury s i mean I be just suggest that the whole appeal process suggest that the crucial death eligibility determination be be make by the judge because that be the only death eligibility determination that the appeal court be ever go to review yes look they have something to review the problem be it be the judge s thing to that they be review not the jury s and that be a sixth amendment problem ,349.36999999999995,Roberts Court,"Oct 13, 2015",Timothy Lee Hurst,Florida,14-7505,"Mar 9, 2015","Jan 12, 2016",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2015,Nichols v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"But it is current. It is current at all the time in which he resides there. Well, then, you're just reading pursuant to subsection (a) out of the statute. Excuse me, Mr. Gannon. It tells you exactly what it means to be a jurisdiction involved. It means a jurisdiction involved pursuant to a particular subsection which focuses only on his current residence. And all the time he was a current resident of Kansas, the registry was accurate. Mr. Gannon -- It seems to me that what you're saying is that each of those offenders is supposed to recognize the underlying purpose of the law, which is to have accurate registries, and to do everything he can to serve that underlying purpose. And we would -- you know, it would be good if everybody did that. But the text of the law is something different. And if you look at this text of the law, there's just no way that a reasonable reader reads that text and says it requires me to provide departure notification when I leave to another country. So you can say well, he's supposed to keep it current, and -- and that's right. He is -- he should keep it current, because we would all like sex registry. But the statute provides very specific details about what it means to keep it current, and it seems to me he has conformed with every single one of those requirements. You know, he could have, and he should have. But he didn't have to under -- -- this statutory language. It -- it says he has to have informed at least one jurisdiction involved pursuant to subsection (a), and subsection (a) makes clear that the only jurisdictions that they're talking about are the jurisdictions in which he currently either lives, works, or is a student. And that morning -- That morning, everything was current. And then when he left Kansas, he's not subject to this statutory provision anymore. That -- That is 16921(b)? Is that the one you're referring to there? But 16921(b)(3) is specifically an obligation that's placed on officials. It has nothing to do with any obligations on offenders. So but an offender is supposed to look at a statute that places only an obligation on State officials and to say, really? That obligation applies to me as well? Could I -- could I ask a question, Mr. Gannon, of absolutely no legal significance? Chalk it up to curiosity. Does the Federal government bring many of these prosecutions? Because I might have thought that when sex offenders leave the country permanently, the attitude might be like, good luck and good riddance? (Laughter.) But you're not -- you're -- as I understand the requirement that even you say he's subject to, it's just a requirement that says he's leaving the State. It doesn't -- he's not required to tell you where he's going in the world. He could be going to the Philippines or any other country. So it doesn't really help us in terms of, you know, helping our allies deal with sex offenders. I'm just curious why it is that people -- why DOJ makes the decision to bring sex offenders back to this country in such circumstances. I am right, right, that when you say he had the responsibility to keep the registry accurate, that's just to say he had the responsibility to tell Kansas he was no longer in Kansas. Even on your view, he had no other responsibilities. Right. And I completely understand that, Mr. Gannon, but even your own interpretation doesn't get you the information -- (Laughter.) (Lights out.) My red light on the bench is still working. (Laughter.) -- does not get you the information that you need in order to tell the Philippines, look, you have a sex offender in your midst.

2015,Green v. Brennan,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Wolfman -- If -- you might be pulled in two different directions here but you don't have to accept what Justice Sotomayor is saying to win this case; isn't that right? In other words, one could say, yes, if you had discriminatory acts language, that might point to the last predicate discriminatory act as opposed to the resignation, it might or it might not, but here that language doesn't exist. Here the language is discriminatory matter. That refers to the entire claim. And when you refer to the entire claim, it's clear that the resignation is part and parcel of that. And it at least creates ambiguity, such that the default rule would operate. So you don't have not to go to that -- Do the predicate acts have to be independently actionable or not? Well, you just sort of made those two synonymous. But they don't have to be synonymous. A matter might mean the claim, not the particular discriminatory conduct that's the predicate for the claim. I mean, this is an unusual kind of claim and it's an unusual kind of claim because there are predicate acts and then there is also clearly a resignation which clearly has to occur before the suit can be brought. And when there is this, you know, this composite set of things that has to go on before a suit, it seems to me that it's at least approaching the kind of possible ambiguous -- ambiguous stage to say, yeah, that's a matter, that's a practice that both of those things have to be part of it. There's something more than just simplicity, which is, you know, suppose you had a case where somebody is first demoted and then somebody is fired. You would never say, oh, he was demoted. He suffered the injury then, it just raised the stakes. You would say, no, there's two independent things and now he can bring a termination claim. And the power of the constructive-discharge claim is to say the exact same thing really has happened here, that once you lose the job, it's more than the stakes have been raised. It's that there is a separate injury that then becomes legally actionable. But if we're going to say, yes, these are different and for some purposes we're going to look to the fiction and for other purposes we're not going to look to the fiction, it seems to me as though here it makes sense to take account of the fiction in the sense that the person cannot bring a claim until the resignation has happened. So that's the kind of paradigmatic case in which, boy, there is something really powerful pushing that, yes, you can -- you should recognize the constructive discharge as a discharge in this case. ",mr wolfman if you might be pull in two different direction here but you do not have to accept what justice sotomayor be say to win this case be not that right in other word one could say yes if you have discriminatory act language that might point to the last predicate discriminatory act as oppose to the resignation it might or it might not but here that language do not exist here the language be discriminatory matter that refer to the entire claim and when you refer to the entire claim it be clear that the resignation be part and parcel of that and it at least creates ambiguity such that the default rule would operate so you do not have not to go to that do the predicate act have to be independently actionable or not well you just sort of make those two synonymous but they do not have to be synonymous a matter might mean the claim not the particular discriminatory conduct that be the predicate for the claim i mean this be an unusual kind of claim and it be an unusual kind of claim because there be predicate act and then there be also clearly a resignation which clearly have to occur before the suit can be bring and when there be this you know this composite set of thing that have to go on before a suit it seem to me that it be at least approach the kind of possible ambiguous ambiguous stage to say yeah that be a matter that be a practice that both of those thing have to be part of it there be something more than just simplicity which be you know suppose you have a case where somebody be first demote and then somebody be fire you would never say oh he be demote he suffer the injury then it just raise the stake you would say no there be two independent thing and now he can bring a termination claim and the power of the constructive discharge claim be to say the exact same thing really have happen here that once you lose the job it be more than the stake have be raise it be that there be a separate injury that then become legally actionable but if we be go to say yes these be different and for some purpose we be go to look to the fiction and for other purpose we be not go to look to the fiction it seem to me as though here it make sense to take account of the fiction in the sense that the person can not bring a claim until the resignation have happen so that be the kind of paradigmatic case in which boy there be something really powerful push that yes you can you should recognize the constructive discharge as a discharge in this case ,165.57999999999996,Roberts Court,"Nov 30, 2015",Marvin Green,"Megan J.

2015,Campbell-Ewald Company v. Gomez,114,Elena Kagan,"But that's a merits question as to whether they're entitled to attorneys' fees. If the question is complete -- you know, ""complete relief"" means what the plaintiff has asked for. The plaintiff has asked for attorneys' fees here. But if I could go back a little bit, Mr. Garre. And this is, I think, the question that Justice Scalia started with. There are a number of things that you've said, well, he asked for it, but he's not entitled to it. He asked for attorneys' fees, but he's not entitled to attorneys' fees. And he asked for an injunction or declaratory relief, and he's not entitled to that. And he asked for class certification, but he's not entitled to that, and so the case is moot. And the ""so the case is moot"" seems to me to be a non sequitur. In other words, he's asked for these things, you haven't offered these things, and there's a dispute about whether he's entitled to these things. Now, you might be completely right as to the ""He's not entitled to attorneys' fees."" But that has to be adjudicated. You can't -- a court can't just say, Oh, you've offered complete relief, because in his view you haven't offered complete relief, and that's what the litigation is all about. A court can absolutely make that determination. But the question is does the Court make that determination in the guise of a mootness motion? But Mr. Garre -- -- and this is very much along the same lines -- you know, you have an old English case. You have these three cases in the '90s, 1890s, which were really about liabilities had -- that had already been satisfied, and the court said, it's already been satisfied, payment has already been made. But there's really no history at all -- and tender offers have existed for a long, long time. There's no history at all of -- of saying that a tender offer moots a case, as opposed to the classic understanding, the common law understanding, of tender offers was that it created an incentive for parties, and that that was their purpose and that was their effect, was to incentivize parties to do something, but not to -- for -- not to provide a mechanism for a court just to throw out a case when a party decided that, for whatever reason, he thought that the tender offer was not good enough. Well, but I -- I said that mootness is not the appropriate remedy in that case. The appropriate remedy in a case where it's absolutely clear that -- that the -- that the defendant has given -- has offered the plaintiff everything the plaintiff has asked for, which it's not in this case, but where it's absolutely clear where the defendant has offered everything that the plaintiff himself has asked for, the appropriate thing to do, in order to prevent wasteful litigation, is not to dismiss the case for mootness but to grant judgment in favor of the plaintiff. Well, it doesn't become moot, it's just been decided. It's -- there's been an adjudication at that point. There's nothing to dismiss. Mr. Garre, both sides have these class action policy arguments, but it's important not to let those drive this pretty technical mootness question. So if we could just take the class action arguments out of it. Just let's say that there's a plaintiff, and he claims 10,000 -- he wants $10,000 plus attorneys' fees, okay? And the defendant says, I'll give you $10,000. And the plaintiff says, no, I really want attorneys' fees too. And the defendant says, no, you're not entitled to attorneys fees. Plaintiff says, no, I think I am. I'll -- I think I -- I'm going to reject your settlement offer. So you say at that point the Court can come in and say, oh, the case is moot. Now, how is that possible? There's a -- there's a contested question as to what one person owes another. The -- the defendant has said he doesn't want to accept this offer because he doesn't think it gives him everything that's entitled -- he's entitled to. And the measure of complete relief has to be, at this stage, about what his complaint asks for. Then you submit the case -- -- on the merits. There's a very -- there's a very easy response to this, which is if it's frivolous, if it's trivial, you dismiss the case on the merits. And I take it that this judgment that you're talking about would be: He offered this. It's everything that you asked for. We are ordering that he pay it. And -- -- and -- and now the thing is dismissed. ",but that be a merits question as to whether they be entitle to attorney fee if the question be complete you know complete relief mean what the plaintiff have ask for the plaintiff have ask for attorney fee here but if i could go back a little bit mr garre and this be i think the question that justice scalia start with there be a number of thing that you have say well he ask for it but he be not entitle to it he ask for attorney fee but he be not entitle to attorney fee and he ask for an injunction or declaratory relief and he be not entitle to that and he ask for class certification but he be not entitle to that and so the case be moot and the so the case be moot seem to me to be a non sequitur in other word he be ask for these thing you have not offer these thing and there be a dispute about whether he have entitle to these thing now you might be completely right as to the he be not entitle to attorney fee but that have to be adjudicate you can not a court can not just say oh you have offer complete relief because in his view you have not offer complete relief and that be what the litigation be all about a court can absolutely make that determination but the question be do the court make that determination in the guise of a mootness motion but mr garre and this be very much along the same line you know you have an old english case you have these three case in the s s which we be really about liability have that have already be satisfy and the court say it be already be satisfy payment have already be make but there be really no history at all and tender offer have exist for a long long time there be no history at all of of say that a tender offer moot a case as oppose to the classic understanding the common law understanding of tender offer be that it create an incentive for party and that that be their purpose and that be their effect be to incentivize party to do something but not to for not to provide a mechanism for a court just to throw out a case when a party decide that for whatever reason he think that the tender offer be not good enough well but i i say that mootness be not the appropriate remedy in that case the appropriate remedy in a case where it be absolutely clear that that the that the defendant have give have offer the plaintiff everything the plaintiff have ask for which it have not in this case but where it be absolutely clear where the defendant have offer everything that the plaintiff himself have ask for the appropriate thing to do in order to prevent wasteful litigation be not to dismiss the case for mootness but to grant judgment in favor of the plaintiff well it do not become moot it be just be decide it be there be be an adjudication at that point there be nothing to dismiss mr garre both side have these class action policy argument but it be important not to let those drive this pretty technical mootness question so if we could just take the class action arguments out of it just let us say that there be a plaintiff and he claim he want plus attorney fee okay and the defendant say I will give you and the plaintiff say no i really want attorney fee too and the defendant say no you be not entitle to attorney fee plaintiff say no i think i be I will i think i I be go to reject your settlement offer so you say at that point the court can come in and say oh the case be moot now how be that possible there be a there have a contested question as to what one person owe another the the defendant have say he do not want to accept this offer because he do not think it give him everything that be entitle he be entitle to and the measure of complete relief have to be at this stage about what his complaint asks for then you submit the case on the merit there be a very there be a very easy response to this which be if it be frivolous if it be trivial you dismiss the case on the merit and i take it that this judgment that you be talk about would be he offer this it be everything that you ask for we be order that he pay it and and and now the thing be dismiss ,252.02,Roberts Court,"Oct 14, 2015",Campbell-Ewald Company,Jose Gomez,14-857,"May 18, 2015","Jan 20, 2016",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2015,Simmons v. Himmelreich,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Martinez -- If I could ask you about the -- what I take to be the Respondent's primary argument in the case now, which is the meaning of this phrase ""the provisions of this chapter in Section 1346(b) shall not apply"" -- -- and of course, that would include the judgment bar. So if you take that provision for all it's worth, it says that the judgment bar shall not apply. So what is your response to that? That really does make the -- the language something it's not. Instead of the provisions of this chapter in 1346(b), that's what the provision says, you're essentially reading it to say Section 2674 of this chapter and Section 1346(b) So that's a real shift in what the language actually says. That's a -- No, no, no. We're all being so polite today. 2679 is different, though, right? Because 2679, the text of it, says that the exceptions shall be applicable to FTCA actions. So although the Court didn't directly confront this issue, what it might have said, if it had confronted the issue, was something like, well, 2679, which comes along later, and says all the exceptions are applicable to FTCA actions, essentially says -- creates an exception to the general rule of inapplicability. That's slicing the bologna pretty thin. (Laughter.) I mean, you know, they're trying to set up language that applies to a whole bunch of different provisions and saying, you know, all of these provisions don't apply in the context of lawsuits, basically. Now that's where the Respondents use an argument very much like the one you just used. They say definitions don't apply to claims; isn't that right? It's a wash. But presumably just then the normal appeals provisions would apply. You would still be able to appeal a case; you just wouldn't have this special court of claims option. Before -- if I could just interrupt very quickly. Of the other three, which ones are still current today? Could I take you back to the ""shall not apply"" language for a second? When -- when you were speaking to the Chief Justice, you said, well, the definitional section will continue to apply because definitions apply to terms and not to claims. But then Mr. Martinez said something very similar to that. He said the judgment bar applies to judgments, not claims. So if you're right as to that, why isn't he right as well? And the consequence of his being right was -- is that he would have taken the judgment bar out of that sweeping ""shall not apply"" language as well. ",mr martinez if i could ask you about the what i take to be the respondent s primary argument in the case now which be the meaning of this phrase the provision of this chapter in section b shall not apply and of course that would include the judgment bar so if you take that provision for all it be worth it say that the judgment bar shall not apply so what be your response to that that really do make the the language something it be not instead of the provision of this chapter in b that be what the provision say you be essentially read it to say section of this chapter and section b so that be a real shift in what the language actually say that be a no no no we be all be so polite today be different though right because the text of it say that the exception shall be applicable to ftca action so although the court do not directly confront this issue what it might have say if it have confront the issue be something like well which come along later and say all the exception be applicable to ftca action essentially say create an exception to the general rule of inapplicability that be slice the bologna pretty thin laughter i mean you know they be try to set up language that apply to a whole bunch of different provision and say you know all of these provision do not apply in the context of lawsuit basically now that be where the respondent use an argument very much like the one you just use they say definition do not apply to claim be not that right it be a wash but presumably just then the normal appeal provision would apply you would still be able to appeal a case you just would not have this special court of claim option before if i could just interrupt very quickly of the other three which one be still current today could i take you back to the shall not apply language for a second when when you we be speak to the chief justice you say well the definitional section will continue to apply because definition apply to term and not to claim but then mr martinez say something very similar to that he say the judgment bar applies to judgment not claim so if you be right as to that why be not he right as well and the consequence of his be right be be that he would have take the judgment bar out of that sweep shall not apply language as well ,156.64,Roberts Court,"Mar 22, 2016",Jermaine Simmons et al.,Walter J.

2015,Harris v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission,114,Elena Kagan,"Just to pin this down a -- a little bit, Mr. Hearne: You -- you are not contesting the factual finding that the predominant motive was to comply with the Voting Rights Act; is that right? Well, you keep on saying mixed motive, and I guess people keep on coming back to you and just trying to figure out whether you are in fact or not in fact contesting that -- that the predominant motive was the Voting Rights Act. Was the attempt to comply with the Voting Rights Act? And this -- and the -- and the court found, and it is a factual finding, that that's the predominant motive? And I don't mean to harangue you on this. I just want to understand what your argument is. But I -- I thought -- I -- I thought, Mr. Hearne, that you were saying that the -- that the thing that you had presented had to do with an impermissible motive, and the impermissible motive was that they didn't have to do all this for Voting Rights Act compliance; is that right? Right. But that's the very thing that you said, you weren't challenging the factual finding, that that was a subsidiary part of the redistricting. The dominant part was the voting rights compliance, and I take it you want to undermine the voting rights compliance rationale. But then I'm stuck on the same question that Justice Scalia is stuck on, is what evidence did you present that -- that there was an impermissible motive with respect to that, as opposed to different views as to what the Voting Rights Act compelled. I guess I'm not sure what that means. Can you explain -- I guess I'm just not really sure. Let's -- let's say that there's a policy that says we want to respect county lines. And we also know that we want to do one-person, one-vote, but we think we have, basically, some leeway up to 10 percent. And -- and there's a policy. We want to respect county lines, even though that's going to cause a little bit more deviation on the one-person, one-vote metric. Are you saying that that's impermissible? It's a policy. I mean, it's an intentional policy. Even though it just, say, takes you from 4 to 5 percent, or from 7 to 8 percent. You're not crossing the 10 percent threshold. But as long as you're going up, and you're doing it purposefully -- -- in the sense of we have a policy to maintain county lines, that's impermissible? Ms. -- I thought it was because they wanted to make super sure that they complied with the Voting Act. I think -- I think that that's why they said they kept going. If I could ask the -- the question that Ms. Harrington left with, was that -- I'm sorry. Even -- if -- if you're saying that even within the 10 percent, you know, to go from 1 percent to 2 percent, or from 2 percent to 3 percent, and then somebody can come in and say that's partisanship, it means that every single plan will be up for grabs in every single place, doesn't it?

And there's been some back-and-forth, I think, about what that means. What does it mean? But it seems, Mr. Katyal, that you are relying on remedies that really developed very late in equity's life. In other words, you know, equity was going along, and there were these very formal rules distinguishing it from the legal world. And then as it progressed, there were -- people thought we need some cleanup authority, or maybe even people just thought these rules aren't working in the way that we want them to work. So equity got a little bit less equitable as it approached the merger with law. But that, I think, is not really what we've meant when we've said we're looking to things that are typically equitable. You know, not like the last throes of equity as it was becoming a legal system. Well, you take the -- the deficiency judgments, which, I take it, was a rule was needed to give equity that authority, because everybody thought equity didn't have that authority.

2015,Musacchio v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"If I could go back to your main argument. You seem to be suggesting that the inquiry that we should be undertaking really focuses on this jury and how this jury made its decision. But I had thought that some of our prior cases, in particular, Jackson, suggests that that's not the correct inquiry. That the correct inquiry really is -- is as to a hypothetical jury, any jury. And so your focus on, well, the way that these instructions might have affected this particular jury just really isn't the right one at all. I -- I would have -- the -- the most recent case that we had, which was Wong, makes clear the statute of -- of limitations generally are not jurisdictional, and I would think suggests that you really have to have language saying it is jurisdictional to overcome that presumption. In other words, just a strong-sounding statute of limitations wouldn't cut it according to Wong. That's the way I would read that. But are you saying that we should adopt a different interpretive rule in the criminal context? Is that what I understood you to say? That suggests that you wouldn't even look to the indictment. That you would just look to the statute. So Mr. Martinez, just -- I'm sorry. Just going back to this question of whether it's the statute or the indictment, you think you just look to the indictment to tell you which statutes to look to, but if the indictment would, let's say, add an extra element, that doesn't matter? You should -- you should look to the statute in the -- -- in the same way that you're suggesting here we shouldn't look to the instructions? But -- but I guess I -- it is -- that does seem a little bit troubling to me just because of the function of an indictment is providing notice, that if the indictment gets the statute wrong, that -- that the government should be stuck with that because that's what -- you know, that's what the defendant now thinks is the charge. Suppose you took a converse case where the instructions favored the government and the defendant didn't object, is convicted, then brings a sufficiency claim. Do you again say it really is measured as against the statute? It has nothing to do with the instructions? Well, that might be true sometimes, but it doesn't seem as though that's the ordinary case. I mean, why would you have -- you could -- you can make an exception for cases in which there really -- the government has -- is able to come in and say, we really need to develop the record. But where that's not true, why wouldn't you decide this as quickly as you could? ",if i could go back to your main argument you seem to be suggest that the inquiry that we should be undertake really focus on this jury and how this jury make its decision but i have think that some of our prior case in particular jackson suggest that that be not the correct inquiry that the correct inquiry really be be as to a hypothetical jury any jury and so your focus on well the way that these instruction might have affect this particular jury just really be not the right one at all i i would have the the most recent case that we have which be wong make clear the statute of of limitation generally be not jurisdictional and i would think suggests that you really have to have language say it be jurisdictional to overcome that presumption in other word just a strong sound statute of limitation would not cut it accord to wong that be the way i would read that but be you say that we should adopt a different interpretive rule in the criminal context be that what i understood you to say that suggest that you would not even look to the indictment that you would just look to the statute so mr martinez just I be sorry just go back to this question of whether it be the statute or the indictment you think you just look to the indictment to tell you which statutes to look to but if the indictment would let us say add an extra element that do not matter you should you should look to the statute in the in the same way that you be suggest here we should not look to the instruction but but i guess i it be that do seem a little bit trouble to me just because of the function of an indictment be provide notice that if the indictment get the statute wrong that that the government should be stick with that because that be what you know that be what the defendant now think be the charge suppose you take a converse case where the instruction favor the government and the defendant do not object be convict then bring a sufficiency claim do you again say it really be measure as against the statute it have nothing to do with the instruction well that might be true sometimes but it do not seem as though that be the ordinary case i mean why would you have you could you can make an exception for case in which there really the government have be able to come in and say we really need to develop the record but where that be not true why would not you decide this as quickly as you could ,143.78,Roberts Court,"Nov 30, 2015",Michael Musacchio,United States,14-1095,"Jun 29, 2015","Jan 25, 2016",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2015,Utah v. Strieff,114,Elena Kagan,"But I assume, Mr. Green, that there are a variety of circumstances in which police officers would really like to talk to somebody and really like to search them but don't have reasonable suspicion. And I think that the question that Justice Sotomayor is asking is if you're policing a community where there is some significant percentage of people who have arrest warrants out on them, it really does increase your incentive to -- to make that stop on the chance that there will be a warrant that will allow you to search and admit whatever evidence you gained in that search. Well, but this is an officer who -- you say this is a close call. So let's say that there are close calls. But you don't think you have reasonable suspicion, or you think you maybe do if you find a good judge out there, but -- but you -- there is a reason why you want to talk. So this is not a flagrant violation. This is not a dragnet search or something like that. But you -- if -- if -- I mean, it does change your incentives quite dramatically, it seems to me, if you're policing a community where there is some significant percentage of people who have arrest warrants. That's the only way they can be absolutely sure. But -- but here, there's -- there's some chance that they're going to find the arrest warrant and then they're going to be able to admit the evidence that they're going to get, whereas before, there was none. And that some chance is not like a once-in-a-blue-moon kind of chance. In these very heavily-policed areas, it's -- I mean, I was staggered by the number of arrest warrants that are out on people. So it's, you know, a significant possibility that you're going to find an arrest warrant and be able to admit whatever drugs or guns or whatever it is you find. So what is an intervening circumstance, in your view? What is your test for what it is? Okay. And your view is that we should look at the question of whether something is an intervening circumstance through the deterrence lens. That makes a lot of sense. We look at everything through a deterrence lens with respect to the exclusionary rule. And that, you know, what we're supposed to say is this -- does this appreciably increase deterrence or not; is that correct? And I -- so I guess, then, I'm back to my question. In a world in which finding somebody with an outstanding arrest warrant was an extremely low probability, you would be right. In a world in which it was an extremely high probability, you would be wrong. Then it seems like, where is this on the spectrum? What do we know about that? It sure seems -- I mean, again, I will come back to this. I was surprised beyond measure by how many people have arrest warrants outstanding, and particularly in the kind of areas in which these stops typically tend to take place. So that, it seems to me, you know, is a pretty strong argument for why this will increase deterrence. But I guess -- I -- I take the point, Mr. Bash, but I guess I just don't understand. Of course, this is a nationwide rule that we would be setting. But most Terry stops do not happen in most neighborhoods. Most Terry stops happen in very high-crime neighborhoods -- appropriately, but where people have lots of arrest warrants. And -- and you might be right about the specific Ferguson case, but I still have my question, which is why doesn't that dramatically change the incentives for police officers in deciding whether to search somebody? If you know that there is a significant possibility that somebody you stop is going to have an arrest warrant, that's another reason to stop them. But does that mean that we're going to have to, in every single case, explore the officer's subjective motivations? Because that sounds like the kind of inquiry that we've tried to stay away from in the past. ",but i assume mr green that there be a variety of circumstance in which police officer would really like to talk to somebody and really like to search them but do not have reasonable suspicion and i think that the question that justice sotomayor be ask be if you be police a community where there be some significant percentage of people who have arrest warrant out on them it really do increase your incentive to to make that stop on the chance that there will be a warrant that will allow you to search and admit whatever evidence you gain in that search well but this be an officer who you say this be a close call so let us say that there be close call but you do not think you have reasonable suspicion or you think you maybe do if you find a good judge out there but but you there be a reason why you want to talk so this be not a flagrant violation this be not a dragnet search or something like that but you if if i mean it do change your incentive quite dramatically it seem to me if you be police a community where there be some significant percentage of people who have arrest warrant that be the only way they can be absolutely sure but but here there be there be some chance that they be go to find the arrest warrant and then they be go to be able to admit the evidence that they be go to get whereas before there be none and that some chance be not like a once in a blue moon kind of chance in these very heavily police area it be i mean i be stagger by the number of arrest warrant that be out on people so it be you know a significant possibility that you be go to find an arrest warrant and be able to admit whatever drug or gun or whatever it be you find so what be an intervening circumstance in your view what be your test for what it be okay and your view be that we should look at the question of whether something be an intervening circumstance through the deterrence lens that make a lot of sense we look at everything through a deterrence lens with respect to the exclusionary rule and that you know what we be suppose to say be this do this appreciably increase deterrence or not be that correct and i so i guess then I be back to my question in a world in which find somebody with an outstanding arrest warrant be an extremely low probability you would be right in a world in which it be an extremely high probability you would be wrong then it seem like where be this on the spectrum what do we know about that it sure seem i mean again i will come back to this i be surprise beyond measure by how many people have arrest warrant outstanding and particularly in the kind of area in which these stop typically tend to take place so that it seem to me you know be a pretty strong argument for why this will increase deterrence but i guess i i take the point mr bash but i guess i just do not understand of course this be a nationwide rule that we would be set but most terry stop do not happen in most neighborhood most terry stop happen in very high crime neighborhood appropriately but where people have lot of arrest warrant and and you might be right about the specific ferguson case but i still have my question which be why do not that dramatically change the incentive for police officer in decide whether to search somebody if you know that there be a significant possibility that somebody you stop be go to have an arrest warrant that be another reason to stop them but do that mean that we be go to have to in every single case explore the officer s subjective motivation because that sound like the kind of inquiry that we have try to stay away from in the past ,245.38,Roberts Court,"Feb 22, 2016",Utah,Edward Joseph Strieff,14-1373,"Oct 1, 2015","Jun 20, 2016",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2015,Wittman v. Personhuballah,114,Elena Kagan,"So, Mr. Carvin -- -- let's assume that that's true and that that is -- counts as an injury-in-fact. We also have this other requirement in the law, which we talk about a lot less, but it seems to be quite well established, which is that there needs to a kind of legally recognized interest. So it's not just that you have to have an injury-in-fact, although you have to have that, but that there needs to be an injury to a legally recognized interest. So what is the legally recognized interest here that the -- the legislators are banking on? No, that's -- that's -- that's, you know, he wants to be elected. He has been injured-in-fact in the kind of practical ways we can all understand to be injury. But this other part of the test really suggests that you need a kind of legal recognition of your claim, and that's what I'm searching for here. Are you saying that that part of our standing doctrine which does look as to whether there is a legally cognizable right is only good for plaintiffs, and that once the inquiry shifts to the defendant, it just completely drops out of the picture? I wasn't -- I wasn't -- I wasn't contesting the injury-in-fact requirement. I think I was -- I was asking about -- and it really is a question -- how this other separate requirement, which is that the invasion of -- that has to be to a legally protected interest applies in the context of a defendant. And you're just suggesting it drops out entirely. And I guess I'm suggesting -- I mean, I might be right, but it seems odd that a plaintiff would have to show it, and a defendant, it -- it just disappears from the inquiry. So the legally cognizable interest is -- just finish the sentence for me. That just -- that just makes the legally cognizable interest the same as the injury-in-fact requirement. Mr. Carvin, can I -- can I take you back to the merits? Let me give you a hypothetical. It's not this case. It's a different case. Let's say that there are some racist mapdrawers, and -- and they say, here's what we're going to do. We're going to set districts, and we really want to segregate African-Americans. And so -- and they say, that's our -- that's our first aim. But we also have a second aim. It turns out that African-Americans vote in a particular way. And so our second aim is that we are going to achieve some kind of partisan advantage as a result of this segregation. Now what should be the right answer to that question? Is there strict scrutiny in such a case? You're making -- you're making my hypothetical more complicated than it is. We're just -- this it one district, we're just going to segregate all the African-American voters in this district. We're doing that primarily because of racial reasons. We don't like African-American voters, and we're just going to keep them all in one district. And secondarily, that has politically-beneficial consequences for us. Is -- and -- and so the question is, is that unconstitutional, because you know, if I look at that, I say, okay, that's -- the race was your primary motivation. That triggered strict scrutiny. You failed strict scrutiny; you're out of the ball game. But you suggest that you're not out of the ball game because you have this secondary interest which coincides with the clearly racist conduct. And that's the question that I want you to answer. Okay. So then -- then you're -- then it seems to me you're changing your argument because in my hypothetical, both of these things run together. They're not in conflict with each other. So you're saying the -- the critical question is not conflict. I had thought that you thought that the critical question was conflict. Rather, the critical question is which is the primary motivation or which is the but-for purpose, and which is the secondary motivation, even if both run in line with each other. That's a different kind of test. This is -- this is -- it's very clear, just as it is in this case I have to say, they have a list of criteria, and number one on the list is race. And then we have a lot of direct evidence in my hypothetical that this is for the most heinous racial purposes imaginable. And the question is, does the fact that it also has political benefits, does that insulate these line drawers from what you would think is the obvious conclusion, which is this is unconstitutional conduct? Well, he says, this is our first priority. But in my hypothetical -- -- it's his first priority because he is a racist line drawer. That -- that sounds to me as though it's a harmless error rule for racial discrimination. And we've never had a harmless error rule for racial discrimination. What we've said is, look, we just found racially-discriminatory purpose, end of case. Yes, but -- Well, the first seven words of that quote are ""in a case such as this one."" And the question is what did they mean by that? And one understanding of what they meant when they said ""in a case such as this one"" is in a case in which there was no direct evidence of racial motivation but only circumstantial evidence, and -- and the -- and the absence or the presence of a map was indeed relevant to the question of whether that circumstantial evidence added up to the conclusion that race was the motivator. No. It's just in a case such as this one, the case before us. Well, why didn't we ask for a map in Alabama? Is that what you're making it right on? Do you agree with the Solicitor General that a simple statement from the line drawers that they were trying the best they can to comply with the Voting Rights Act, that that is not sufficient to -- to have strict scrutiny apply? Yes. No. I got that. I'm saying assume a different -- a different set of facts where they weren't just saying we have to stick at 53.1, or we have to go at 55.55 percent. Assume a different state of facts where line drawers simply say of course our first priority is to comply with the law. Do you think that that itself triggers strict scrutiny? So what you think triggers strict scrutiny is essentially the use of a mechanical target here? It's not related to the ability to elect? But if you -- yeah, I -- I'm sorry. I -- I guess I find this a little bit harder than you just suggested, because this is not Representative Forbes saying, I want to choose exactly the set of voters that's going to increase my own electoral chances. This is Representative Forbes saying, look, there has been an act of the legislature, and the -- the act of the legislature has given me a certain set of voters, and why don't I have a legally cognizable interest in relying on that legislative judgment when some court has taken it away? Well, I take the point, Mr. Carvin, but isn't that really exactly what we confronted in Alabama, which is -- you know, the number one priority was the VRA, but then it turned out that they had misunderstood the VIA, so it turned out that the number one priority was a racial quota, which had nothing to do with the way the VRA is really supposed to operate? ",so mr carvin let us assume that that be true and that that be count as an injury in fact we also have this other requirement in the law which we talk about a lot less but it seem to be quite well establish which be that there need to a kind of legally recognize interest so it be not just that you have to have an injury in fact although you have to have that but that there need to be an injury to a legally recognize interest so what be the legally recognize interest here that the the legislator be bank on no that be that be that be you know he want to be elect he have be injure in fact in

just make the legally cognizable interest the same as the injury in fact requirement mr carvin can i can i take you back to the merit let me give you a hypothetical it be not this case it be a different case let us say that there be some racist mapdrawers and and they say here s what we be go to do we be go to set district and we really want to segregate african american and so and they say that be our that be our first aim but we also have a second aim it turn out that african american vote in a particular way and so our second aim be that we be go to achieve some kind of partisan advantage as a result of this segregation now what should be the right answer to that question be there strict scrutiny in such a case you be make you be make my hypothetical more complicated than it be we be just this it one district we be just go to segregate all the african american voter in this district we be do that primarily because of racial reason we do not like african american voter and we be just go to keep them all in one district and secondarily that have politically beneficial consequence for us be and and so the question be be that unconstitutional because you know if i look at that i say okay that be the race be your primary motivation that trigger strict scrutiny you fail strict scrutiny you be out of the ball game but you suggest that you be not out of the ball game because you have this secondary interest which coincide with the clearly racist conduct and that be the question that i want you to answer okay so then then you be then it seem to me you be change

2015,Taylor v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, Mr. Jones, suppose you had been able to show this. Suppose you had been able to show that it was a dealer who dealt in intrastate marijuana exclusively. What difference would that have made under the terms of the Hobbs Act? Well, you see, that's the thing. I mean, I don't think that the Hobbs Act requires the government to show an effect on interstate commerce. As you said in your opening statement, the Hobbs Act only requires an effect on commerce, and then commerce is defined: Commerce means all commerce over which the United States has jurisdiction. Now, for sure the United States has jurisdiction over interstate commerce, but under Raich it also has jurisdiction over intrastate drug trafficking. And so if you just sort of put the pieces of the statutes together, it seems to make it completely irrelevant whether the drug trafficking was intrastate or interstate, because in either case, it was commerce over which the United States has jurisdiction. But -- but doesn't the Hobbs -- doesn't Raich say that the government has -- the United States has jurisdiction over intrastate drug trafficking? So why isn't that enough? Because this statute, again, does not require that there be an effect on interstate commerce. It -- it affects -- it requires that there be an effect on commerce as defined in the statute. And as defined in the statute, all it says is that the commerce has to be one of a kind over which the United States has jurisdiction. And Raich says the United States has jurisdiction over even intrastate drug dealing. Well -- Mr. -- Mr. Jones, I guess I'm trying to figure out what we're disagreeing about. So let me give you a proposition, and you tell me whether you agree with it. The Hobbs Act prohibits robberies that affect marijuana trafficking, whether the marijuana traffic is interstate or intrastate. Do you agree with that? But why is that? Because that's what I was saying at the beginning, that it seems clear to me that under the terms of the Hobbs Act, the Hobbs Act does prohibit robberies that affect commerce. Raich says commerce includes both interstate and intrastate marijuana trafficking. So the Hobbs Act prohibits robberies that affect marijuana trafficking generally, whether it's interstate or intrastate. What's there to disagree with in that? Well -- Well, but I said -- I used the word ""affects."" I didn't use the word ""regulate."" I said the Hobbs Act prohibits robberies that affect commerce. Commerce is either interstate marijuana trafficking or intrastate marijuana trafficking under the definition in this statute. So you -- the government has to show that a robbery affected some kind of marijuana trafficking. It doesn't matter what kind. Wouldn't you agree with that? I mean, it just seems -- -- it's the current of the statute plus Raich. Well, I guess this goes back to Justice Kennedy's question. I mean, seems to me pretty self-evident that a robbery of a business affects a business. Wouldn't you think that that's right? I mean, I don't think that the word ""affects"" is doing a whole lot of work here, because of course a robbery of a business affects a business, right? Okay. So -- so it's not really ""affects"" that's the problem here. The problem seems to be that you're resisting the notion that the business could be entirely intrastate. But what I'm suggesting is that the terms of the Hobbs Act itself, given Raich, make clear that the business can be intrastate, because the definition of commerce here doesn't say ""interstate commerce."" It says ""commerce over which the United States has jurisdiction."" And because of Raich, we know that the United States has jurisdiction over even intrastate drug dealing. Well, that seems to me a different kind of argument that you're making now. Now you're not saying that the question is whether the marijuana that was being dealt was intrastate or interstate. Now you're suggesting that what you really wanted to prove was that this person wasn't a dealer at all; is that correct? But -- but if -- if -- if I can make sure I understand. The jury is told that you have to find beyond a reasonable doubt that this defendant affected commerce over which the United States has jurisdiction. Is that right? Does that have -- -- to be found beyond a reasonable doubt? But whether the United States has jurisdiction over the marijuana trade, be it inter- or interstate, has already been decided by Raich. Is it -- But that's the question, Mr. Yang: From marijuana dealers. I mean, it seems to me the defendant could say, ""no. ""I was targeting a home grower."" You know, the kind of person from Raich. ""I just -- I was growing this marijuana for myself. ""I had no intention of ever selling it."" At that point, you wouldn't be robbing somebody who was engaged in commerce, right? There are -- Well, maybe the person wasn't a dealer. You said it was a very different thing. And it would be a much harder thing. And it would be at least an awfully good argument by the defendant that if the person was not a dealer, it's not affecting commerce in the regular -- in the relevant way? ",well mr jones suppose you have be able to show this suppose you have be able to show that it be a dealer who deal in intrastate marijuana exclusively what difference would that have make under the term of the hobbs act well you see that be the thing i mean i do not think that the hobbs act require the government to show an effect on interstate commerce as you say in your opening statement the hobbs act only require an effect on commerce and then commerce be define commerce mean all commerce over which the united state have jurisdiction now for sure the united state have jurisdiction over interstate commerce but under raich it also have jurisdiction over intrastate drug trafficking and so if you just sort of put the piece of the statute together it seem to make it completely irrelevant whether the drug trafficking be intrastate or interstate because in either case it be commerce over which the united state have jurisdiction but but do not the hobbs do not raich say that the government have the united state have jurisdiction over intrastate drug trafficking so why be not that enough because this statute again do not require that there be an effect on interstate commerce it it affect it require that there be an effect on commerce as define in the statute and as define in the statute all it say be that the commerce have to be one of a kind over which the united state have jurisdiction and raich say the united state have jurisdiction over even intrastate drug dealing well mr mr jones i guess I be try to figure out what we be disagree about so let me give you a proposition and you tell me whether you agree with it the hobbs act prohibit robbery that affect marijuana trafficking whether the marijuana traffic be interstate or intrastate do you agree with that but why be that because that be what i be say at the beginning that it seem clear to me that under the term of the hobbs act the hobbs act do prohibit robbery that affect commerce raich say commerce include both interstate and intrastate marijuana traffic so the hobbs act prohibit robbery that affect marijuana trafficking generally whether it be interstate or intrastate what be there to disagree with in that well well but i say i use the word affect i do not use the word regulate i say the hobbs act prohibit robbery that affect commerce commerce be either interstate marijuana trafficking or intrastate marijuana traffic under the definition in this statute so you the government have to show that a robbery affect some kind of marijuana trafficking it do not matter what kind would not you agree with that i mean it just seem it be the current of the statute plus raich well i guess this go back to justice kennedy s question i mean seem to me pretty self evident that a robbery of a business affect a business would not you think that that be right i mean i do not think that the word affect be do a whole lot of work here because of course a robbery of a business affect a business right okay so so it be not really affect that be the problem here the problem seem to be that you be resist the notion that the business could be entirely intrastate but what I be suggest be that the term of the hobbs act itself give raich make clear that the business can be intrastate because the definition of commerce here do not say interstate commerce it say commerce over which the united state have jurisdiction and because of raich we know that the united state have jurisdiction over even intrastate drug dealing well that seem to me a different kind of argument that you be make now now you be not say that the question be whether the marijuana that be be dealt be intrastate or interstate now you be suggest that what you really want to prove be that this person be not a dealer at all be that correct but but if if if i can make sure i understand the jury be tell that you have to find beyond a reasonable doubt that this defendant affect commerce over which the united state have jurisdiction be that right do that have to be find beyond a reasonable doubt but whether the united state have jurisdiction over the marijuana trade be it inter or interstate have already be decide by raich be it but that be the question mr yang from marijuana dealer i mean it seem to me the defendant could say no i be target a home grower you know the kind of person from raich i just i be grow this marijuana for myself i have no intention of ever sell it at that point you would not be rob somebody who be engage in commerce right there be well maybe the person be not a dealer you say it be a very different thing and it would be a much hard thing and it would be at least an awfully good argument by the defendant that if the person be not a dealer it be not affect commerce in the regular in the relevant way ,327.16,Roberts Court,"Feb 23, 2016",David Anthony Taylor,United States,14-6166,"Oct 1, 2015","Jun 20, 2016",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2015,Birchfield v. North Dakota,114,Elena Kagan,"This -- Well, why can't we say that with respect to a breath test that this is a search incident to arrest? Well, I think that this would be based on the notion that it's necessary to preserve evidence, plus the notion which Justice Breyer suggested that this is about as uninvasive as a search can possibly be. And so that given those two things together, that it is useful to preserve evidence and that it is a extremely uninvasive search, that we can assimilate it into the search-incident-to-arrest doctrine. Yes, but there's something very different in the level of invasion, and certainly it's appropriate to look at the invasiveness of a search when deciding whether to do a search incident to arrest. I mean, if that weren't true, we wouldn't have talked about how much you could get off of a cell phone in Riley. If that weren't true, we would allow people to do body cavity searches when they do search incident to arrest. So it seems to me that the Court can look at the level of invasion incident to a search when deciding whether a particular search comes within the search-incident-to-arrest doctrine, and that that might be a way of separating out this category of cases from the ones that we were talking about in McNeely. But that's, I guess -- please, go ahead. Yes, you're right that it's designed to get at the same evidence, and you're right that the dissipation of the evidence works in exactly the same way. But you're suggesting that we should close our eyes to the fact that there's a very significant difference in the degree of invasiveness. You know, even assuming that both of these are searches, which I have to say, you know, I think that that's -- we've -- we've held that, and so blowing is a search, there's no question about that, but there are searches, and then, again, there are searches. There are more invasive searches and less invasive searches. And I guess my intuitions are that that's an important difference when we think about these questions. Well -- but I guess the question that I asked -- I mean, I agree with you that you do need a recognized exception, and that we should not feel good about making up new exceptions willy-nilly. The question is, why isn't this a search incident to arrest given the various aspects that I've mentioned, the fact that the evidence does dissipate over time, that getting a warrant might interfere with that, and that it's -- relatively uninvasive. Mr. McCarthy, I think what we're -- people are asking you is to try to get some sense of the real world harms here. So let me ask you to assume something. Assume that you actually could put into practice a system which got you a warrant in 10 or 15 minutes, which many States of a similar kind have done. What then would be your interest in the -- in -- in the rule that you're asking us for? No, but -- But that's what we're asking. Because if you could get a warrant easily in every case, I mean, then I'm struggling to figure out what your interest is in having the kind of law that you have. So -- but maybe I'm just not understanding something. So -- so it really is a question. Suppose you could set up a system where somebody could be reached within 10 or 15 minutes, and they would, in almost all circumstances, give a warrant. And in a couple, say, no, I don't think you've satisfied the requirements, right? So -- and you could do that in 10 or 15 minutes. What would be the problem with just relying on a system like that? But I'm asking about your practical needs, and then, you know, we'll figure out like what is or what isn't consistent with the Fourth Amendment. But your practical needs. Could I ask you just a different kind of just factual question, which -- how many of these are done roadside, how many are taken to the police station, when are people taken to a police station? What is the practice? Sorry. I see your red light. Can I ask a different -- maybe a different way of asking a similar kind of question. When we decided McNeely, there were two opinions. But even the opinion that was, you know, the concurrence, or just -- I don't remember whether it was a concurrence or a dissent -- but the one that was -- The Chief Justice's opinion, even that said -- and this was with respect to a blood test. But the Chief Justice's opinion said, look, if there's 20 minutes between the time that you're stopped and the time that we can get you to a hospital to get a blood draw, and you can get a warrant in that 20 minutes, then yes, you have to go get a warrant in that 20 minutes. So at the very least, why wouldn't that be the case? You know, if -- if you're -- if all of these things -- I mean, I have to say when I originally thought about this case, I had in my mind roadside stops. But in all of these cases you're actually driving these people to a station house. So why can't you get a -- at least what the Chief Justice said in McNeely, which is, okay, if you can get a warrant within that time, you have to get a warrant within that time. Well, why is that? Why -- why in Maryland have they been able to and Virginia not? But there are more and more every year, aren't there? I mean, we're now up to over 40, aren't -- ",this well why can not we say that with respect to a breath test that this be a search incident to arrest well i think that this would be base on the notion

2015,Husky Electronics v. Ritz,114,Elena Kagan,"Are you piercing the corporate veil as to the first company, or as to the transferee companies? Right. Because -- because I understood your whole brief to be pursuing this on a recipient theory. And your brief, you know, makes some sense as that. But then when you look back to your complaint, it suggests that the veil-piercing actually was attempted as to the transferor company, which doesn't do you any good under your theory. It does make the language ""false pretenses"" or ""false representations"" completely superfluous, yes? Ms. Murphy points out that there are lots of other provisions in 523(a), which have a lot of overlap on this provision on your reading. And then also the fraudulent conveyance provisions, if you would talk a little bit about those. Well, you just said you're not contesting that fraudulent conveyance is a form of actual fraud; is that right? So, now, this language -- I mean, the language just seems a lot more simple than you're making it, because you add inducement to the language, you add from the creditor to the language. But the language doesn't say any of those things. It just says is there a debt? And we know that there is a debt here. The debt is for money. The language says, well, what has to be true of that money? It has to be obtained by actual fraud. And here, the money, the allegation is, was obtained by fraudulent concealment. So whether or not the creditor has been induced and whether or not the money has come from the creditor seems to be irrelevant under this very simple statutory phrase. The transferee -- the transferee obtains the money by way of the fraudulent conveyance, right? How else does the transferee obtain the money? Through a fraudulent conveyance. But it would be a very strange thing, Ms. Murphy, if -- if I agreed with you, if I were Congress and I said, I want to make it really clear that this should be only intentional, false pretenses and false representation. There are a gazillion ways to do that, but starting with the simple one, saying intentional false pretenses and an intentional false representation. But the one thing I wouldn't do, I think, is to say actual fraud. Because actual fraud is not synonymous with -- with intent. Actual fraud refers to -- to conduct that's done with a certain kind of intent. And that conduct, as you just said, includes more than false representation and false pretenses. So I wouldn't use a term that had to do with conduct just to state a mens rea requirement. But if I have that case right, that case is actually a case about a fraudulent conveyance. It's not a case about a false representation. So they said, look at this case. It's a case about a fraudulent conveyance that suggests that there's more fraud in the world than just misrepresentations. And we want to make clear that that's going -- that that's supposed to be a part of this. ",be you pierce the corporate veil as to the first company or as to the transferee company right because because i understand your whole brief to be pursue this on a recipient theory and your brief you know make some sense as that but then when you look back to your complaint it suggest that the veil pierce actually be attempt as to the transferor company which do not do you any good under your theory it do make the language false pretense or false representation completely superfluous yes ms murphy point out that there be lot of other provision in a which have a lot of overlap on this provision on your reading and then also the fraudulent conveyance provision if you would talk a little bit about those well you just say you be not contest that fraudulent conveyance be a form of actual fraud be that right so now this language i mean the language just seem a lot more simple than you be make it because you add inducement to the language you add from the creditor to the language but the language do not say any of those thing it just say be there a debt and we know that there be a debt here the debt be for money the language say well what have to be true of that money it have to be obtain by actual fraud and here the money the allegation be be obtain by fraudulent concealment so whether or not the creditor have be induce and whether or not the money have come from the creditor seem to be irrelevant under this very simple statutory phrase the transferee the transferee obtain the money by way of the fraudulent conveyance right how else do the transferee obtain the money through a fraudulent conveyance but it would be a very strange thing ms murphy if if i agree with you if i we be congress and i say i want to make it really clear that this should be only intentional false pretense and false representation there be a gazillion way to do that but start with the simple one say intentional false pretense and an intentional false representation but the one thing i would not do i think be to say actual fraud because actual fraud be not synonymous with with intent actual fraud refers to to conduct that be do with a certain kind of intent and that conduct as you just say include more than false representation and false pretense so i would not use a term that have to do with conduct just to state a men rea requirement but if i have that case right that case be actually a case about a fraudulent conveyance it be not a case about a false representation so they say look at this case it be a case about a fraudulent conveyance that suggest that there be more fraud in the world than just misrepresentation and we want to make clear that that be go that that be suppose to be a part of this ,176.17999999999995,Roberts Court,"Mar 1, 2016","Husky International Electronics, Inc.","Daniel Lee Ritz, Jr.",15-145,"Nov 6, 2015","May 16, 2016",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2015,Ross v. Blake,114,Elena Kagan,"Ms. Bernhardt, could I just ask you to talk about the procedures? Could you explain to me what they are? Could I start you off in the reverse order? Because the ARP seems to be the low-level one, and in the initial understandings of this case, everybody was being told the ARP is where you file. And you file there irrespective of whether there's an IIU investigation. Do you continue to take that view, or do you think that that is no longer true? I really did ask you to start with the ARP. Are you supposed to file with the ARP even when there's an IIU in -- Well, why do all of these cases suggest that, when that happens, the ARP throws out the case on the view that there's an IIU investigation? Well, you've lodged now quite a number of materials, and we can talk about the materials that you've lodged, but now, you know, both parties have lodged materials, and nobody has come up with a case in which the ARP has adjudicated a complaint when there was an IIU complaint investigation going on; is that right? Ms. Bernhardt, can I just ask, because in the materials you lodged yesterday, in three different places you appeared -- the office appears actually to have a rubber stamp. I mean, it's the same stamp on all these things. And it says, ""Dismissed for procedural reasons. This issue is being investigated by IIU. Since this case shall be investigated by IIU, no further action shall be taken under the ARP."" That's on a rubber stamp. Ms. Bernhardt, we took this case on the view, which was the view that the office represented to us at the time, that the ARP was the proper place to go to receive a remedy, not the proper place to go to receive a rubber stamp saying ""You've come to the wrong place,"" but the proper place to go to receive a remedy even when there was an IIU investigation going on. Notwithstanding this rubber stamp that says it's not true. Can I -- Can I ask, it seems to me that there are three kinds of unavailability. And I'm wondering if you agree with each of the three. One is where the prison says, you can get your remedy over here. And then it turns out that you can't get your remedy over here. So if the prison here said, you can get your remedy at the ARP, but you couldn't get your remedy at the ARP, that's a kind of factual unavailability. You agree with that? In the hypothetical sense -- -- not saying anything about this case? Now, the second is what you're saying. It's like, if it's just so confusing that a reasonable person can't use it. And that's your standard; right? And the third is some of these cases arise in the context where the State is deliberately trying to interfere with or trick the inmate or something like that. And you would count that as unavailable too? A threat or just deception or something like that. Do we think that the Fourth Circuit was wrong with respect to that? I mean, it's a problem leaving it on the books, isn't it? Do you think that there is also substantial daylight between your standard and the solicitor general's standard? In other words, what I took the solicitor general to be saying with respect to this clarity question is that the standard is if the procedures are so confusing that a reasonable person could not use them. That's his standard. Do you think that there is a difference between yours and his? If I could understand you, though, I mean, one argument that you would have, whether here or below or -- is this notion of the prison system didn't meet this level of clarity, whatever it is. But there's another argument, don't you think -- or do you think -- that you have, which is just, they said to go to the ARP, and the ARB -- the ARP was not in the business of giving this remedy. So we did exactly what we were told to do, and it turns out the remedy is unavailable because it's just not available. ",ms bernhardt could i just ask you to talk about the procedure could you explain to me what they be could i start you off in the reverse order because the arp seem to be the low level one and in the initial understanding of this case everybody be be tell the arp be where you file and you file there irrespective of whether there be an iiu investigation do you continue to take that view or do you think that that be no longer true i really do ask you to start with the arp be you suppose to file with the arp even when there be an iiu in well why do all of these case suggest that when that happen the arp throw out the case on the view that there be an iiu investigation well you have lodge now quite a number of material and we can talk about the material that you have lodge but now you know both party have lodge material and nobody have come up with a case in which the arp have adjudicate a complaint when there be an iiu complaint investigation go on be that right ms bernhardt can i just ask because in the material you lodge yesterday in three different place you appear the office appear actually to have a rubber stamp i mean it be the same stamp on all these thing and it say dismiss for procedural reason this issue be be investigate by iiu since this case shall be investigate by iiu no further action shall be take under the arp that be on a rubber stamp ms bernhardt we take this case on the view which be the view that the office represent to us at the time that the arp be the proper place to go to receive a remedy not the proper place to go to receive a rubber stamp say you have come to the wrong place but the proper place to go to receive a remedy even when there be an iiu investigation go on notwithstanding this rubber stamp that say it be not true can i can i ask it seem to me that there be three kind of unavailability and I be wonder if you agree with each of the three one be where the prison say you can get your remedy over here and then it turn out that you can not get your remedy over here so if the prison here say you can get your remedy at the arp but you could not get your remedy at the arp that be a kind of factual unavailability you agree with that in the hypothetical sense not say anything about this case now the second be what you be say it be like if it be just so confuse that a reasonable person can not use it and that be your standard right and the third be some of these case arise in the context where the state be deliberately try to interfere with or trick the inmate or something like that and you would count that as unavailable too a threat or just deception or something like that do we think that the fourth circuit be wrong with respect to that i mean it be a problem leave it on the book be not it do you think that there be also substantial daylight between your standard and the solicitor general s standard in other word what i take the solicitor general to be say with respect to this clarity question be that the standard be if the procedure be so confusing that a reasonable person could not use them that be his standard do you think that there be a difference between yours and his if i could understand you though i mean one argument that you would have whether here or below or be this notion of the prison system do not meet this level of clarity whatever it be but there be another argument do not you think or do you think that you have which be just they say to go to the arp and the arb the arp be not in the business of give this remedy so we do exactly what we we be tell to do and it turn out the remedy be unavailable because it be just not available ,236.11999999999992,Roberts Court,"Mar 29, 2016",Michael Ross,Shaidon Blake,15-339,"Dec 11, 2015","Jun 6, 2016",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2015,Ocasio v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, why isn't that test satisfied here, because the shop owners agreed that Mr. Ocasio would commit every element of the substantive offense? Well, the -- the -- Mr. Ocasio is committing every element of the substantive offense. He is obtaining property from another; that is, he's obtaining property from the body shop owners. And the body shop owners agreed that he would do so. So it seems to me that in the normal way that conspiracy law works, there is a conspiracy here. They only need to agree that he should obtain property from another, and that is exactly what they agreed to. Well, they're two different words, but the syntactical problem seems to me to be identical, which is that it's just not natural to say that the transported woman is herself transporting any woman, right? I mean, the transported woman is not transporting any woman. But the reason the Court said that a conspiracy was possible there was because the transported woman could agree with another person, let's say, the man, that the man would transport any woman, namely, herself. It's -- it's an almost identical syntactical issue. No, I don't think that's right. The ""from another"" is clearly an element of the substantive offense. But you're saying it should also be a freestanding limit on the conspiracy offense, and there's no reason for that to be true. It is, of course, right that somebody has to obtain property from another, but the conspiracy offense is made out if two people agree that somebody should obtain property from another. And that's exactly the situation here. They intended and they agreed that Mr. Ocasio should obtain property from another. And that's all they have to do. It's a statute, and the statute just says the other has to be somebody different from Ocasio himself. So in this particular case, the somebody other is the people who are in the agreement. In another case, the somebody other might be somebody who is outside the agreement. The statute just -- the -- the substantive law says it has to be from another. The conspiracy -- and this is just -- it's consistent with Salinas, it's consistent with Holt, it's consistent with everything we've ever said about conspiracy law -- is that it just has to be an agreement for somebody to do that substantive offense even if the people agree and can't do it themselves. And it's true, the people agreeing can't do it themselves. They can't obtain property from another. But Mr. Ocasio can, and they're agreeing that he should. Mr. Davis, if you could go back to what you just said about the consent. I mean, look, I mean, Evans makes perfectly clear that bribes and kickbacks are included in this statute. And -- and there is a difference between -- there -- there are cases in which somebody participates in a kickback scheme and does not consent. I mean, suppose some public official comes in and says, in order for me to give you a license to do something, to be, you know, a member of some profession, let's say a cosmetologist, you need to pay me $20 as a kickback. And the person, you know, pays him $20 because you've got to get your license. But there's no way in the world in which that would count as a conspiratorial agreement. It would count as consent under the Hobbs Act. So there's a big gap between consent and a conspiratorial agreement, even in the context of bribes. But I -- I -- So if -- If -- if I could just understand what you're saying, you think active participation is more than an agreement along the typical conspiracy lines. Right. But -- -- this does sound more like an aiding and abetting standard than it does a conspiracy standard, because typically in conspiracy we say it doesn't really matter if you actively participate, as long as you reach an agreement. Now that agreement is more than acquiescence, right? It's more than I reluctantly give you the bribe that you're demanding of me. But -- but I guess I'm with Justice Scalia that I don't really quite understand how to get from the typical real agreement that we require in conspiracy cases to some higher standard with respect to this crime of active participation. You had no other substantive crime to charge against the brothers? And, indeed, isn't it right that what Justice Breyer is saying was the very theory behind Evans, why this was extortion, is because the real crime was to the public at large, not to any particular customer. But yes, there was a crime to the -- the general public. Mr. Davis, I don't think you need to add words. What you need is to shift perspective. There is a difference here, but that's the difference, that the government is insisting that you look at it from the perspective of the person who, in this case, is doing the acts of obtaining property from another. And you are insisting that it be looked at from the perspective of the person who has agreed to help him do that. But there's no reason under standard conspiracy law that we would use the perspective of the agreer rather than the perspective of the perpetrator. There absolutely is a unity of purpose, that one person should do the crime. ",well why be not that test satisfy here because the shop owner agree that mr ocasio would commit every element of the substantive offense well the the mr ocasio be commit every element of the substantive offense he be obtain property from another that be he be obtain property from the body shop owner and the body shop owner agree that he would do so so it seem to me that in the normal way that conspiracy law work there be a conspiracy here they only need to agree that he should obtain property from another and that be exactly what they agree to well they be two different word but the syntactical problem seem to me to be identical which be that it be just not natural to say that the transported woman be herself transport any woman right i mean the transported woman be not transport any woman but the reason the court say that a conspiracy be possible there be because the transported woman could agree with another person let us say the man that the man would transport any woman namely herself it be it be an almost identical syntactical issue no i do not think that be right the from another be clearly an element of the substantive offense but you be say it should also be a freestanding limit on the conspiracy offense and there be no reason for that to be true it be of course right that somebody have to obtain property from another but the conspiracy offense be make out if two people agree that somebody should obtain property from another and that be exactly the situation here they intend and they agree that mr ocasio should obtain property from another and that be all they have to do it be a statute and the statute just say the other have to be somebody different from ocasio himself so in this particular case the somebody other be the people who be in the agreement in another case the somebody other might be somebody who be outside the agreement the statute just the the substantive law say it have to be from another the conspiracy and this be just it be consistent with salina it be consistent with holt it have consistent with everything we have ever say about conspiracy law be that it just have to be an agreement for somebody to do that substantive offense even if the people agree and can not do it themselves and it be true the people agree can not do it themselves they can not obtain property from another but mr ocasio can and they be agree that he should mr davis if you could go back to what you just say about the consent i mean look i mean evans make perfectly clear that bribe and kickback be include in this statute and and there be a difference between there there be case in which somebody participate in a kickback scheme and do not consent i mean suppose some public official come in and say in order for me to give you a license to do something to be you know a member of some profession let us say a cosmetologist you need to pay me as a kickback and the person you know pay him because you have get to get your license but there be no way in the world in which that would count as a conspiratorial agreement it would count as consent under the hobbs act so there be a big gap between consent and a conspiratorial agreement even in the context of bribe but i i so if if if i could just understand what you be say you think active participation be more than an agreement along the typical conspiracy line right but this do sound more like an aiding and abet standard than it do a conspiracy standard because typically in conspiracy we say it do not really matter if you actively participate as long as you reach an agreement now that agreement be more than acquiescence right it be more than i reluctantly give you the bribe that you be demand of me but but i guess I be with justice scalia that i do not really quite understand how to get from the typical real agreement that we require in conspiracy case to some high standard with respect to this crime of active participation you have no other substantive crime to charge against the brother and indeed be not it right that what justice breyer be say be the very theory behind evans why this be extortion be because the real crime be to the public at large not to any particular customer but yes there be a crime to the the general public mr davis i do not think you need to add word what you need be to shift perspective there be a difference here but that be the difference that the government be insist that you look at it from the perspective of the person who in this case be do the act of obtain property from another and you be insist that it be look at from the perspective of the person who have agree to help him do that but there be no reason under standard conspiracy law that we would use the perspective of the agreer rather than the perspective of the perpetrator there absolutely be a unity of purpose that one person should do the crime ,316.9400000000001,Roberts Court,"Oct 6, 2015",Samuel Ocasio,United States,14-361,"Mar 2, 2015","May 2, 2016",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2015,Betterman v. Montana,114,Elena Kagan,"So -- so what would the remedy be in a case like this? For example, Mr. Rowley, just to continue on this line of questioning, there's another case that we have which dealt with civil forfeitures, which is the $8,850 in U.S. currency case where it said, Well, we're going to do a due process analysis, but we're going to take the Barker factors as our test for that due process analysis. So I think one of the questions that Justice Sotomayor is asking is: Why wouldn't that be equally appropriate here? In other words, even if -- and I'm not saying that this is right, but even if there's -- this is -- falls within the due process box rather than the Sixth Amendment box, that there's still a further question as to whether the Lovasco approach is right or whether this U.S. currency approach is right. I guess I'm -- I guess I'm not -- just not sure what you -- you mean by that, because in this other case, the civil forfeiture case, we just said we're going to apply the four factors of Barker. And if that were the result of the due process approach, I mean, it just wouldn't make any difference which box it was in. General, there -- there may be some real differences between the pretrial context and the presentencing context, but one which seems quite similar is the potential of delay to impair the defense. So I guess I would like you to address that, because, you know, as the Petitioners point out, in most cases these days, most of the actual adjudication of contested issues goes on in sentencing rather than at the trial stage, given that we don't have very many trials anymore. And certainly Barker and certainly Doggett made it very clear that this was an important interest in thinking about the speedy trial right. Well, doesn't -- Lovasco really talks about a whole different set of considerations in the pretrial context, which simply don't apply once the indictment -- once the accusation has been made. Well, sometimes, but there may also be real factual disputes. It might be about the amount of loss. It might be about the amount of drug quantity. It might be about prior bad acts. It might be about a whole range of things which are the kinds of things that we actually typically think of as contested issues at trial. Well, that -- that might present some challenges, but there are also challenges on the other side. It's often hard to show that people have forgotten things, that, you know, they've forgotten them. So unless there's something like a witness dying, it's very difficult to make the kind of showing that you are suggesting. And that's why Barker, you know, left things flexible and said, you know, in most cases, we really are going to look at prejudice. We're going to see what you have to say for yourself. In some extreme cases, we're not going to do that. So, again, I guess I'm back with Justice Breyer's question as to, yes, this is a different context, but why don't all the same considerations apply? I wasn't suggesting presumed prejudice, because Barker doesn't suggest presumed prejudice. As you say, the difference that Barker has with respect to your test is simply that Barker says it's not always necessary to show prejudice, that there are extreme circumstances in which we'll just take that for granted. Well, but if you think that a very significant part of this rule has to do with impairment of the ability to defend yourself, and if you think that that kind of consideration applies just as well at the sentencing phase as it does at the conviction stage, maybe in most cases more so, given that most of the action these days takes place in the sentencing phase, I guess I just wouldn't see why there's any need for a different rule, especially given the level of flexibility that Barker gives. It's not like Barker says we're presuming prejudice in all circumstances. Barker is saying prejudice is one of the four factors. And it's a very important one. And usually we'll expect people to come in with some kind of showing, except for in extreme cases when not. Well, that's what we said in Barker when we were talking about a pretrial case, but the remedy in this case would be different. And how did you see that as different from what goes on under the Barker analysis? But I take it that we've said that that's the case where the delay is super-long, so take a delay of eight or ten years. And, you know, why is it in that very extreme circumstance that the defendant should make -- that the defendant should have to make any particularized showing? Your rule would apply to capital cases, as well? I'm sorry. Could you say a little bit more than that? You would -- you would say because the penalty phase really is a trial? Ms. Anders, I'm sorry, one of the things that strikes me as odd about your argument is that you are suggesting that a remedy would be appropriate in certain circumstances. You just want to put this under the Due Process Clause. And what's -- what's odd is that, as you say, that in this post-conviction context, the president -- the -- the defendant has been deprived of any liberty interest, and yet the Due Process Clause talks about a deprivation of liberty, but the defendant no longer has a liberty interest. So it seems a very odd place to park this right and this remedy, the Due Process Clause, in this context. It seems much more natural that you would do it under the Speedy Trial Clause on the assumption -- on the -- on the view that the -- that the trial has to do with both the adjudication of guilt and the determination of the proper sentence. ",so so what would the remedy be in a case like this for example mr rowley just to continue on this line of question there be another case that we have which deal with civil forfeiture which be the in us currency case where it say well we be go to do a due process analysis but we be go to take the barker factor as our test for that due process analysis so i think one of the question that justice sotomayor be ask be why would not that be equally appropriate here in other word even if and I be not say that this be right but even if there be this be fall within the due process box rather than the sixth amendment box that there be still a further question as to whether the lovasco approach be right or whether this us currency approach be right i guess I be i guess I be not just not sure what you you mean by that because in this other case the civil forfeiture case we just say we be go to apply the four factor of barker and if that we be the result of the due process approach i mean it just would not make any difference which box it be in general there there may be some real difference between the pretrial context and the presentencing context but one which seem quite similar be the potential of delay to impair the defense so i guess i would like you to address that because you know as the petitioner point out in most case these day most of the actual adjudication of contested issue go on in sentence rather than at the trial stage give that we do not have very many trial anymore and certainly barker and certainly doggett make it very clear that this be an important interest in think about the speedy trial right well do not lovasco really talk about a whole different set of consideration in the pretrial context which simply do not apply once the indictment once the accusation have be make well sometimes but there may also be real factual dispute it might be about the amount of loss it might be about the amount of drug quantity it might be about prior bad act it might be about a whole range of thing which be the kind of thing that we actually typically think of as contested issue at trial well that that might present some challenge but there be also challenge on the other side it be often hard to show that people have forget thing that you know they have forget them so unless there be something like a witness dying it be very difficult to make the kind of show that you be suggest and that be why barker you know leave thing flexible and say you know in most case we really be go to look at prejudice we be go to see what you have to say for yourself in some extreme case we be not go to do that so again i guess I be back with justice breyer s question as to yes this be a different context but why do not all the same consideration apply i be not suggest presume prejudice because barker do not suggest presumed prejudice as you say the difference that barker have with respect to your test be simply that barker say it be not always necessary to show prejudice that there be extreme circumstance in which we will just take that for grant well but if you think that a very significant part of this rule have to do with impairment of the ability to defend yourself and if you think that that kind of consideration applies just as well at the sentence phase as it do at the conviction stage maybe in most case more so give that most of the action these day take place in the sentencing phase i guess i just would not see why there be any need for a different rule especially give the level of flexibility that barker give it be not like barker say we be presume prejudice in all circumstance barker be say prejudice be one of the four factor and it be a very important one and usually we will expect people to

2015,Puerto Rico v. Franklin California Tax-Free Trust,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Landau, could I ask you to focus on the text here a little bit? Because this gateway theory of yours, I'm not sure it matches up with the text very well. I mean, you could have a gateway provision which said something like, Puerto Rico is a State for all purposes except Chapter 9, or except for any provision in Chapter 9, or something like that. But Chapter 9 -- but this provision, 101(52), is written much more specifically. It says, ""except for the purpose of defining who may be a debtor under Chapter 9."" So it's not any provision in Chapter 9; it's just for the purpose of defining who may be a debtor. So, Mr. Landau, I -- I think I get what you're saying now, which I didn't when I started with. You're saying they couldn't just say it's a State, except for purposes of Chapter 9, because, in fact, there's something that's outside of Chapter 9 that determines who gets into Chapter 9. So what they did was they said it's a State, except for purposes of this gateway, and then they assumed that that meant that all of Chapter 9 wouldn't apply either. That's your basic argument. So -- but before 1984, before this amendment, this 903(1) did apply to Puerto Rico; wasn't that right? So you're saying that the really super significant change, which is 903(1) applies to Puerto Rico before 1984, and then doesn't apply after 1984 because of this definitional move that they made here in 101(52). What you have to admit is -- I'm not quite sure what the -- the word -- I mean, it's a -- it would be a mysterious way, it would be an extremely kind of cryptic odd way to make such a major change. I mean, it's almost like somebody doesn't want everybody to recognize what a major change is being made -- -- and figured out this way that is -- where nobody would understand that that was happening, including the judges who would have to decide what this meant. (Laughter.) Please. Mr. McGill -- Can I talk to you about Mr. Landau's textual argument? Because I came in here thinking that your best argument is straight on the text. It's not about purpose, because I don't know what Congress's purpose here was; it's not on policy. It's just straight on the text. But I now have a better understanding of Mr. Landau's understanding of the text, and so I just want to engage you on that, which is: Look, Congress couldn't have just said ""except for purposes of Chapter 9"" because of this flukey thing, which is that the gateway provision is outside of Chapter 9. So if it had just said ""except for purposes of Chapter 9,"" somebody could have said, oh, well, look, I am entitled to be a debtor under Chapter 9, whether or not I'm thought of as a State. And so they did it this other way, which said -- which attacked the gateway provision particularly. And then in doing that, they assumed that all of Chapter 9 would follow in its wake. Once you're not eligible for Chapter 9, none of the provisions of Chapter 9 apply to you. That's basically Mr. Landau's provision -- argument. So tell me why that's wrong. Well, Mr. -- Mr. McGill, if I could go back to Justice Breyer's question, because Justice Breyer gave you a view of the way to read this text, which is built on Mr. Landau's view, and said, what's wrong with that? And you -- you go with the gateway provision, and then even if not all of Chapter 9 follows in its wake, at least all the provisions in Chapter 9 that refer to debtors follow in its wake. And Justice Breyer said, what's wrong with that, as a way to read this text. And then you answered him, I think this is fair to say, by giving a -- a story about what Congress meant to do in 903(1) in the wake of Faitoute. But, you know, both of you have stories about this, and it's not -- just not clear which of you is right. And I guess what I most want to think about is this text. Why isn't Justice Breyer's, Mr. Landau's view of the text just as good, if not better, than yours? And I didn't come in here thinking that, but now I kind of am thinking that. So talk to me about the text, why that's not just as good a view of the text? But that's -- that's a purpose that tells you whether you're now in Chapter 9 as a debtor. So what Mr. Landau is saying is once you say you're -- you're -- you're not a State, when it comes to who may be a debtor under Chapter 9, that it's a pretty natural thing to say, and that means that any provisions about being a debtor under Chapter 9 don't apply to you. ",mr landau could i ask you to focus on the text here a little bit because this gateway theory of yours I be not sure it match up with the text very well i mean you could have a gateway provision which say something like puerto rico be a state for all purpose except chapter or except for any provision in chapter or something like that but chapter but this provision be write much more specifically it say except for the purpose of define who may be a debtor under chapter so it be not any provision in chapter it be just for the purpose of define who may be a debtor so mr landau i i think i get what you be say now which i do not when i start with you be say they could not just say it be a state except for purpose of chapter because in fact there be something that be outside of chapter that determines who get into chapter so what they do be they say it be a state except for purpose of this gateway and then they assume that that mean that all of chapter would not apply either that be your basic argument so but before before this amendment this do apply to puerto rico be not that right so you be say that the really super significant change which be applies to puerto rico before and then do not apply after because of this definitional move that they make here in what you have to admit be I be not quite sure what the the word i mean it be a it would be a mysterious way it would be an extremely kind of cryptic odd way to make such a major change i mean it be almost like somebody do not want everybody to recognize what a major change be be make and figure out this way that be where nobody would understand that that be happen include the judge who would have to decide what this meant laughter please mr mcgill can i talk to you about mr landau s textual argument because i come in here think that your best argument be straight on the text it be not about purpose because i do not know what congress s purpose here be it be not on policy it be just straight on the text but i now have a good understanding of mr landau s understanding of the text and so i just want to engage you on that which be look congress could not have just say except for purpose of chapter because of this flukey thing which be that the gateway provision be outside of chapter so if it have just say except for purpose of chapter somebody could have say oh well look i be entitle to be a debtor under chapter whether or not I be thought of as a state and so they do it this other way which say which attack the gateway provision particularly and then in do that they assume that all of chapter would follow in its wake once you be not eligible for chapter none of the provision of chapter apply to you that be basically mr landau s provision argument so tell me why that be wrong well mr mr mcgill if i could go back to justice breyer s question because justice breyer give you a view of the way to read this text which be build on mr landau s view and say what be wrong with that and you you go with the gateway provision and then even if not all of chapter follow in its wake at least all the provision in chapter that refer to debtor follow in its wake and justice breyer say what be wrong with that as a way to read this text and then you answer him i think this be fair to say by give a a story about what congress mean to do in in the wake of faitoute but you know both of you have story about this and it be not just not clear which of you be right and i guess what i most want to think about be this text why be not justice breyer s mr landau s view of the text just as good if not well than yours and i do not come in here think that but now i kind of be think that so talk to me about the text why that be not just as good a view of the text but that be that be a purpose that tell you whether you be now in chapter as a debtor so what mr landau be say be once you say you be you be you be not a state when it come to who may be a debtor under chapter that it be a pretty natural thing to say and that mean that any provision about be a debtor under chapter do not apply to you ,295.32999999999987,Roberts Court,"Mar 22, 2016","Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, et al.","Franklin California Tax-Free Trust, et al.",15-233,"Dec 4, 2015","Jun 13, 2016",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2015,"Tyson Foods, Inc. v. Bouaphakeo",114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Phillips, you say the question is whether it can proceed as a class. But it seems as though that's really not the question in this case because of Mt. Clemens; that what Mt. Clemens does is to suggest that certain kinds of statistical evidence are completely appropriate in FLSA cases generally, even if they're brought by the government, or even if they're brought by a single person. And so the question that you really are putting before us is not a Rule 23 question, it's a question of whether this sort of evidence complies with the Mt. Clemens standard; isn't that right? But the Rule 23 inquiry, Mr. Phillips, is always dependent on what the substantive law is. That was true in Halliburton where we said, look, if we didn't have the basic presumption, we would think of this as very individualized. But we have the basic presumption, so the proof is not individualized. And the same thing, it seems to me, is true here because of the Mt. Clemens inquiry. Where it says if the employer hasn't kept the appropriate records, even a single plaintiff can prove the amount of work done through the use of statistical -- I can't see how that account of Mt. Clemens would make most -- much sense. You're suggesting that a person past 40 can produce the statistical evidence, but if I worked 39 1/2 hours and all of this overtime is going to push me over 40, the Mt. Clemens presumption wouldn't be available to me? And now that has to be distributed. So there are going to be further proceedings to distribute that lump sum judgment. Mr. Phillips -- But there -- But, Mr. Phillips, there is a way. If I could go back to Justice Kennedy's question at the start, because it really was your decision not to have a bifurcated proceeding, where it would have been clear -- it would have been proved separately in a highly ministerial way which employees worked over 40 hours. And having made that decision, you're in a position now where you're saying, oh, there's one sum -- there's one lump judgment; we don't know what to do with it. But, in -- in essence, what's going to happen is that it's going to go back in remand, and the judge is going to do something that looks an awful like -- lot like the bifurcation that you rejected, which is, the Court will say, now we figure out in this highly ministerial way who worked more than 40 hours, and so who is entitled to share in the judgment. But it -- it absolutely helps with the question, your second question presented, which is this point that you are making that there might be some people who didn't work 40 hours, who would nonetheless get money. And it absolutely helps for that. It takes care of the entire problem. That leaves you with only your first question presented -- -- which is this question about was the class too varied. And on that, I have to go back to this -- to this issue of, it's not a class issue. It's an FLSA issue under Mt. Clemens as to whether this kind of statistical evidence could have been presented. ",mr phillips you say the question be whether it can proceed as a class but it seem as though that be really not the question in this case because of mt clemens that what mt clemens do be to suggest that certain kind of statistical evidence be completely appropriate in flsa case generally even if they be bring by the government or even if they be bring by a single person and so the question that you really be put before us be not a rule question it be a question of whether this sort of evidence complies with the mt clemens standard be not that right but the rule inquiry mr phillips be always dependent on what the substantive law be that be true in halliburton where we say look if we do not have the basic presumption we would think of this as very individualized but we have the basic presumption so the proof be not individualize and the same thing it seem to me be true here because of the mt clemens inquiry where it say if the employer have not keep the appropriate record even a single plaintiff can prove the amount of work do through the use of statistical i can not see how that account of mt clemens would make most much sense you be suggest that a person past can produce the statistical evidence but if i work hour and all of this overtime be go to push me over the mt clemens presumption would not be available to me and now that have to be distribute so there be go to be further proceeding to distribute that lump sum judgment mr phillips but there but mr phillips there be a way if i could go back to justice kennedy s question at the start because it really be your decision not to have a bifurcate proceeding where it would have be clear it would have be prove separately in a highly ministerial way which employee work over hour and have make that decision you be in a position now where you be say oh there be one sum there have one lump judgment we do not know what to do with it but in in essence what be go to happen be that it be go to go back in remand and the judge be go to do something that look an awful like lot like the bifurcation that you reject which be the court will say now we figure out in this highly ministerial way who work more than hour and so who be entitle to share in the judgment but it it absolutely help with the question your second question present which be this point that you be make that there might be some people who do not work hour who would nonetheless get money and it absolutely help for that it take care of the entire problem that leave you with only your first question present which be this question about be the class too varied and on that i have to go back to this to this issue of it be not a class issue it be an flsa issue under mt clemens as to whether this kind of statistical evidence could have be present ,186.88,Roberts Court,"Nov 10, 2015","Tyson Foods, Inc.","Peg Bouaphakeo, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, et al.",14-1146,"Jun 8, 2015","Mar 22, 2016",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2015,"United States Army Corps of Engineers v. Hawkes Co., Inc.",114,Elena Kagan,"Well, on the same lines, could I ask more generally? I mean, one of the reasons I find this case very difficult is because all over the Federal government there are compliance offices of various kinds whose function is to give advice to people. And often that advice comes with very specific recommendations. It says we will not take enforcement action if, or, we do not consider it a violation of law on the following facts. And I guess what I want to know is your view of how this program compares to various other kinds of programs like this, whether it's the -- whether it's tax opinion letters, or SEC opinion letters, or FCC or whatever, how this program compares to those and where you could draw sensible lines, because mostly we want government agencies to do these things. We think that this helps people, to actually know what the government thinks about particular factual situations. So how do we draw lines in this area, in your view? Indeed, that -- Mr. Hopper, can I ask, you know, I was just looking through some other agency's rules and practices. And I'll just give you a couple of examples. The FCC put out rules just this past year, and it says -- with respect to some particular matters, the FCC rules say, the bureau will not bring an enforcement action against a requesting party, a requesting party meaning somebody who requested an opinion, with respect to any action taken in good faith reliance upon an advisory opinion if all of the relevant facts were fully, completely, and accurately presented to the bureau. Now, there's another that I just came across. It's in just a standard SEC, Securities and Exchange Commission, opinion letter. And it says, based on the facts presented, the division will not recommend enforcement action to the Commission. So I guess my question is, this appears to happen all over the place around the Federal government, people setting up offices whose specific purpose is to say come to us, tell us our problem, and we are going to give you a view, and not just a view; we're going to essentially commit that if you have told us the truth, here is your answer, and you can take it to the bank. And I guess I want to know what's different about this than any of the other cases in which the Federal government does that. For good reason. Because people want to know these things. Well, these are -- this is very strong language that are in these letters. We will not recommend action. We -- we will not bring an enforcement action. So, you know, just as you say, this basically says to us we were in the clear if we passed this. So do these letters. Let me ask you about that, because that's certainly -- this -- this process does last a long time, and it's -- even Mr. Stewart, I think, would say this is a more formal process than many that are -- that exist around the Federal government. But I guess I'm wondering about the incentives of the kind of distinction that you would make. Because it would suggest, you know, that agencies should not -- should draw back, should not give a fully informed view, should not do the fact-finding that the board -- that that -- the Corps does here. You know, should -- should just make their processes less formal, but in -- in making their processes less formal, also less accurate and less helpful. And I guess I wonder who that benefits in the end. Well, I guess I don't quite understand that, because it seems as though they could make it less formal, and they could provide less assurance, and -- and still, there would be very few people who would want to run the gauntlet. And so you wouldn't gain anything. All you would do was to lose something, and what you lose is accurate, reliable information provided to people about whether, in fact, these waters are -- fall within the Clean Water Act. Did Mr. -- Mr. Hopper -- A more general way to ask this question. I mean, there's no doubt that some people face themselves in -- in real predicaments when they're looking at the -- when they're trying to figure out what to do under the Clean Water Act. But of course, you know, that's true with respect to many regulatory statutes. And I think what Mr. Stewart's point was, was that the predicament is the same regardless of the JD process. If the JD process didn't exist, your client would be facing the exact same predicament. And indeed, the JD's -- the JD process's reason for being is that it's supposed to help people in dealing with this predicament because it's supposed to provide them with information that they otherwise wouldn't have. Well, that seems to be a good reason for Mr. Stewart to prevail in this case. But the predicament is the predicament, and it's a predicament that comes from the Clean Water Act. The JD process is -- the only thing it's supposed to do is to give you more information so that you can make the choices that the statute puts to you. Well, that's the question, is whether there's any obligation or whether there's -- it's simply information about what will happen given different courses of action. That seems right. But it's also why people go to the Treasury Department for tax letters, and it's also why people go to the SEC for advice about what they can and cannot do with respect to securities. And it's also -- I mean -- -- at least a hundred different examples. Well, Mr. Hopper, can I ask, do you think that this would count as a formal adjudication under the APA? A formal adjudication under the APA. Would it be -- Would it then receive Chevron deference? Yeah. Not in -- not in that sense, no. I wouldn't think so in that sense. I wouldn't think it's formal adjudication, and I wouldn't think it would receive Chevron deference. And you know, there's a very fine opinion by Judge Sutton on this question, and he basically says the kinds of things that are not final, the kinds of advisory-type rulings that are not final are the ones where there's no Chevron difference given; that that's the proper line to draw. Those -- that's when you know that there's a kind of formality to it that should count with respect to the -- to the question of finalness. Mr. Hopper -- I'm sorry. Please. Isn't that true in every case of an opinion letter, whether it's from the government or for -- actually, from a -- a private party, that, you know, there's always cases in which people say you had an opinion letter; it said X; you did Y. Or, conversely, I had an opinion letter; it said X, I did X. I mean, that happens all over the place in litigation with respect to every single compliance -- piece of compliance advice that the government gives. ",well on the same line could i ask more generally i mean one of the reason i find this case very difficult be because all over the federal government there be compliance office of various kind whose function be to give advice to people and often that advice come with very specific recommendation it say we will not take enforcement action if or we do not consider it a violation of law on the following fact and i guess what i want to know be your view of how this program compare to various other kind of program like this whether it be the whether it be tax opinion letter or sec opinion letter or fcc or whatever how this program compare to those and where you could draw sensible line because mostly we want government agency to do these thing we think that this help people to actually know what the government think about particular factual situation so how do we draw line in this area in your view indeed that mr hopper can i ask you know i be just look through some other agency s rule and practice and I will just give you a couple of example the fcc put out rule just this past year and it say with respect to some particular matter the fcc rule say the bureau will not bring an enforcement action against a request party a request party meaning somebody who request an opinion with respect to any action take in good faith reliance upon an advisory opinion if all of the relevant fact we be fully completely and accurately present to the bureau now there be another that i just come across it be in just a standard sec security and exchange commission opinion letter and it say base on the fact present the division will not recommend enforcement action to the commission so i guess my question be this appear to happen all over the place around the federal government people set up office whose specific purpose be to say come to us tell us our problem and we be go to give you a view and not just a view we be go to essentially commit that if you have tell us the truth here be your answer and you can take it to the bank and i guess i want to know what be different about this than any of the other case in which the federal government do that for good reason because people want to know these thing well these be this be very strong language that be in these letter we will not recommend action we we will not bring an enforcement action so you know just as you say this basically say to us we we be in the clear if we pass this so do these letter let me ask you about that because that be certainly this this process do last a long time and it be even mr stewart i think would say this be a more formal process than many that be that exist around the federal government but i guess I be wonder about the incentive of the kind of distinction that you would make because it would suggest you know that agency should not should draw back should not give a fully inform view should not do the fact find that the board that that the corp do here you know should should just make their process less formal but in in make their process less formal also less accurate and less helpful and i guess i wonder who that benefit in the end well i guess i do not quite understand that because it seem as though they could make it less formal and they could provide less assurance and and still there would be very few people who would want to run the gauntlet and so you would not gain anything all you would do be to lose something and what you lose be accurate reliable information provide to people about whether in fact these water be fall within the clean water act do mr mr hopper a more general way to ask this question i mean there be no doubt that some people face themselves in in real predicament when they be look at the when they be try to figure out what to do under the clean water act but of course you know that be true with respect to many regulatory statute and i think what mr stewart s point be be that the predicament be the same regardless of the jd process if the jd process do not exist your client would be face the exact same predicament and indeed the jd s the jd process s reason for be be that it be suppose to help people in deal with this predicament because it be suppose to provide them with information that they otherwise would not have well that seem to be a good reason for mr stewart to prevail in this case but the predicament be the predicament and it be a predicament that come from the clean water act the jd process be the only thing it be suppose to do be to give you more information so that you can make the choice that the statute put to you well that be the question be whether there be any obligation or whether there be it be simply information about what will happen give different course of action that seem right but it be also why people go to the treasury department for tax letter and it be also why people go to the sec for advice about what they can and can not do with respect to security and it be also i mean at least a hundred different example well mr hopper can i ask do you think that this would count as a formal adjudication under the apa a formal adjudication under the apa would it be would it then receive chevron deference yeah not in not in that sense no i would not think so in that sense i would not think it be formal adjudication and i would not think it would receive chevron deference and you know there be a very fine opinion by judge sutton on this question and he basically say the kind of thing that be not final the kind of advisory type ruling that be not final be the one where there be no chevron difference give that that be the proper line to draw those that be when you know that there be a kind of formality to it that should count with respect to the to the question of finalness mr hopper I be sorry please be not that true in every case of an opinion letter whether it be from the government or for actually from a a private party that you know there be always case in which people say you have an opinion letter it say x you do y or conversely i have an opinion letter it say x i do x i mean that happen all over the place in litigation with respect to every single compliance piece of compliance advice that the government give ,438.81,Roberts Court,"Mar 30, 2016",United States Army Corps of Engineers,"Hawkes Co., Inc., et al.",15-290,"Dec 11,

2015,Duncan v. Owens,114,Elena Kagan,"Sorry, Ms. Shapiro. Could I -- could I take you back, because I just didn't understand -- and I'm sure it was me -- the -- the answer that you gave to Justice Sotomayor's first question. And I think it's important, because it focuses on what the actual issue is here: How much is at issue between the parties? If you had a judge that said, I don't think the evidence is up to snuff here, and then said, the thing that takes me over the line is what I think about the defendant's motive, and that's what allows me to say that the defendant is guilty, and that had not been proved, that had -- the State had never offered that into evidence. It really just came out of the judge's head for whatever reason. Right? Do you think that that would be a due process violation? Yes. Okay. But then -- so the first alternative that you gave, and you said it's not the claim here, but I would have thought it was the claim here because you -- there is obviously a dispute about how to read these words. And we can talk about the -- how to read these words. Right? But once you say, as I think you said, and I think you properly said, Look, if what the -- the judge's various comments on motive was basically taking him over the line, was -- that that was the basis for the verdict of guilty, that he didn't think that all the evidence, the other evidence was enough and that that was crucial to his finding, then, if I understand you right, you would say that's a due process violation because at that point the verdict of guilty is based on evidence that was never presented. Well, the judge is just saying it's not -- you know, this is not enough, and it's necessary for me to think about motive as the missing piece. Oh, I see. So you think that it doesn't matter if the judge thought that the evidence was insufficient as long as the evidence was, in fact, sufficient. Yes. The judge says, you know, all of this evidence, it's not enough. For me, motive is critical to a finding of guilt here. Okay. I mean, so maybe I'm putting words in your mouth, and so tell me if I am. But what I just heard was, look, if he's just telling a story to himself and he basically believes that the evidence that was presented is enough, but he wants to tell a story about some other things that make this all make sense, that's one thing. But -- but if he's really filling in the pieces and deciding -- and -- and determining guilt based on something that was never in the record, that's another thing entirely, and that that would run into all our statements about one accused of a crime is entitled to have his guilt determined solely on the basis of evidence at -- introduced at trial and so forth. Okay. So now I'm going to go back to Justice Sotomayor's second question. And -- but, I mean, just take a look at what he said here. All right? His first sentence is, all of the witnesses skirted the real issue. All right? So all of the witnesses -- there's something wrong with what we've heard from all of the witnesses. They all skirted the real issue. Okay. So what was the real issue? What was the real issue? And then he says, the issue to me is that you have a drug dealer on a bike who Larry Owens, the defendant, knew was a drug dealer, and Owens wanted to knock him off. That's the real issue. And then he says, the State's evidence has proved that fact. What's that fact? Well, that fact is the same thing that he's just said is the real issue, that there was a drug dealer on the bike who knew -- and the defendant knew he was a drug dealer and wanted to knock him off. And then he says, okay. Finding of guilty. I mean, to me, I -- I guess with all the deference in the world, it's just this judge saying, there's something wrong with all the evidence that's been given to me, and here's what's really moving me to find him guilty. But that -- Well, I guess I -- this goes back to Justice Kennedy's question, I guess. We have these statements repeated over and over again. One accused of a crime is entitled to have his guilt or innocence determined solely on the basis of evidence introduced at trial. And what I hear you saying now -- and tell me if this is not what you're saying -- but what I hear you saying now is well, that's true as to real things that are extraneous to a proper factfinder's role, all right? But it's not true, as to -- I mean, I'm just going to say -- this made-up facts. It's not true as to made-up facts; that's different. You can make up facts, and -- and made-up facts don't come within this rule. Is that what you're saying? It's not just -- it's -- it's not just like so I feel good about the case when I go home at night. I mean, this is a factfinder who has a -- a very clear role, which is to adjudicate guilt or innocence. And motive, although not an element in Illinois, motive is relevant to identification, which, in this case, was all about identification. Everybody said that this case was about identification. So when the judge starts making up things about motive -- and I thought that the State really did not contest that this was all made up, that none of it was in the record that got -- you know, who knows how he got this. But he starts making up these things about motive, and then indicating that these things about motive are relevant to his adjudication. To me, I mean, clearly established or not, that just fits under this Taylor principle. I agree with you that there's a question of interpretation. So, I mean, it seems to me like everything comes down to that. Like, if you thought that this judge just made up facts and -- and then said, this is critical to my finding of guilt, I mean, I just think you'd have to say that that's a due process violation under Taylor. That -- that what you do have is you have the ability to come back and say, but that's not what the judge meant. That's not what the judge said, right? Okay. So -- so that narrows the issue. But then it's just like what was he saying, if that wasn't what he was saying? But they didn't conclude that. I mean, Justice Breyer has asked -- you have to give deference, I would think, on the -- the Brecht question, the question of harmlessness. But why would you have to give question on the merits -- on the merits issue? There was no merits determination. I mean, there are two ways to read this opinion, and neither one indicates that deference ought to be given on the merits. One way to read it is that they said it was error, but that it was harmless error. The other way to read it is that notwithstanding the fact that they said it was harmless error, they didn't really mean that. They didn't reach a decision as to the question of whether it was error. But even if that's the case, there's still nothing to give deference to on the merit side. Well, on harmlessness grounds. Whose adjudication on the merits? We might be going in circles, but I thought you just said if -- even if we -- we view this opinion as not reaching a determination on the merits. Harmlessness, you get deference on. There's no question. Harmless, you get deference on. The question is whether you get deference on the notion that this surmising about motive was not error. Because -- because to me, I read this opinion and I say they -- they never say it's not error. Quite the opposite. They declare it harmless error. Okay. So harmlessness, I think you're right, is entitled to deference. But assume if you think that this judge unconstitutionally convicted somebody on the basis of evidence that had never been introduced at trial. If you think that, how could that not be harmful? That's -- I mean, it's almost tautological. If the error is that he convicted somebody on the basis of evidence that was not proper to think about, well, of course, that's harmful. That's why he convicted him. When -- Mr. Levenstam, I -- I guess I don't understand why you're -- I would have thought that the answer to Justice Alito's question was that you're not saying that what happened here -- what went wrong here, you're not saying, is that there was a superfluous finding of fact. You're saying that there is a superfluous finding of fact that actually went into the judge's -- -- final determination. It was not just any old superfluous finding of fact. It was not superfluous. It was a made-up finding of fact that created the judge's final conclusion that the man was guilty. That played some role in that final conclusion. ",sorry ms shapiro could i could i take you back because i just do not understand and I be sure it be me the the answer that you give to justice sotomayor s first question and i think it be important because it focus on what the actual issue be here how much be at issue between the party if you have a judge that say i do not think the evidence be up to snuff here and then say the thing that take me over the line be what i think about the defendant s motive and that be what allow me to say that the defendant be guilty and that have not be prove that have the state have never offer that into

say it be not the claim here but i would have think it be the claim here because you there be obviously a dispute about how to read these word and we can talk about the how to read these word right but once you say as i think you say and i think you properly say look if what the the judge s various comment on motive be basically take him over the line be that that be the basis for the verdict of

because at that point the verdict of guilty be base on evidence that be never present well the judge be just say it be not you know this be not enough and it be necessary for me to think about motive as the miss piece oh i see so you think that it do not matter if the judge think that the evidence be insufficient as long as the evidence be in fact sufficient yes the judge say you know all of this evidence it be not enough for me motive be critical to a finding of guilt here okay i mean so maybe I be put word in your mouth and so tell me if i be but what i just hear be look if he be just tell a story to himself and he basically believe that the evidence that be present be enough but he want to tell a story about some other thing that make this all make sense that be one thing but but if he

accused of a crime be entitle to have his guilt determine solely on the basis of evidence at introduce at trial and so forth okay so now I be go to go back to justice sotomayor s second question and but i mean just take a look at what he say here all right his first sentence be all of the witness skirt the real issue all right so all of the witness there be something wrong with what we have hear from all of the witness they all skirt the real issue okay so what be the real issue what be the real issue and then he say the issue to me be that you have a drug dealer on a bike who larry owen the defendant know be a drug dealer and owens want to knock him off that be the real issue and then he say the state s evidence have prove that fact what be that fact well that fact be the same thing that he be just say be the real issue that there be a drug dealer on the bike who know and the defendant know he be a drug dealer and want to knock him off and then he say okay finding of guilty i mean to me i i guess with all the deference in the world it be just this judge say there be something wrong with all the evidence that be be give to me and here s what be really move me to find him guilty but that well i guess i this go back to justice kennedy s question i guess we have these statement repeat over and over again one accuse of a crime be entitle to have his guilt or innocence determine solely on the basis of evidence introduce at trial and what i hear you say now and tell me if this be not what you be say but what i hear you say now be well that be true as to real thing that be extraneous to a proper factfinder s role all right but it be not true as to i mean I be just go to say this make up fact it be not true as to make up fact that be different you can make up fact and and make up fact do not come within this rule be that what you be say it be not just it be it be not just like so i feel good about the case when i go home at night i mean this be a factfinder who

2015,Zubik v. Burwell,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, Mr. Clement, that might be so. But what happens if somebody did just object to objecting? It seems all your arguments would apply the same way. In other words, somebody comes in and says, I do object to objecting because objecting will make it easier for the government to fill my slot. That's a perfectly understandable thing to say. And that's part of my sincere religious belief. And you say the sincere religious belief is what controls. And there too it would seem under your very theory you would have to say that that's a substantial burden, even if it's objecting to objecting. Yes. Yes. I mean, we have the same penalties that we have here, and the person is just objecting to objecting. And that's part of the religious belief because that will make it more likely that the government will be able to fill the slot and to take efforts to, you know, to -- to provide contraceptives. Well, it's a hypothetical that's directly implicated by your very theory of the case, because your theory of the case says that everything depends on a person coming in saying this is against my religion, and that being the end-all and the be-all. You're just not answering the question. So if I understand that answer, it's that if a person had a sincere religious belief that objecting to objecting was a form of complicity, then that would control, and you would have to go to the second part of the analysis, which is to say, is there a compelling interest test? Has the government's response been narrowly tailored? But essentially, the objecting -- the difference between objecting to objecting and your clients' position is not a difference at all with respect to the burden analysis. I guess what I'm saying, Mr. Clement, is I understand the factual distinction that you're making, but the factual distinction doesn't matter given your own legal analysis. I thought there was a -- a very strong tradition in this country, which is that when it comes to religious exercises, churches are special, and that -- you know, we have said this most recently in Hosanna-Tabor, but it's a long line of cases which says that there's something very special about churches themselves. And -- and if you're saying that every time Congress gives an exemption to churches and synagogues and mosques, that they have to open that up to all religious people, then the effect of that is that Congress just decides not to give an exemption at all. And that's why there are some people who are extremely strong RFRA supporters who have deserted this cause right here, Professor Laycock among them, because of the mortal danger that it poses to churches. Mr. Francisco, I have to admit to not quite understanding this argument, that -- it seems as though the most important laws, the laws that serve the most compelling interests, are -- often have exceptions in them. There are often small business exceptions. There are often transition rules, like the grandfathering provision here. And if, every time that existed, somebody could come in and say, well, the government must not really believe in this law because there is an exception to it, state -- allows some people -- then, I mean, we might as well pack it all in. There's not a law in town that doesn't have exceptions like that. It's lower and lower every single year. Here is the incentives that you would put in place, Mr. Francisco. You would be saying to Congress, Congress, next time you pass a law, don't put in an exemption for churches; you're going to get in real trouble doing that. Don't write transition rules that will help people adjust to a new legal regime; you're going to get in real trouble doing that. Don't write exemptions for small businesses, even though there are very particular concerns that small businesses face; you're going to get in trouble for that. Now, those are terrible incentives to give to a legislature, are they not? Mr. Francisco, may -- may I ask a question? Is there any accomodation that the government would offer that would in fact result in women employees of your clients, or students of your clients, getting health care as part of an employer-based plan or a student-based plan, getting contraceptive coverage? Is there any accomodation that would be acceptable? No, no, no. Through -- in other words, is there -- is there any -- you object to this notification. Is there any kind of notification that would be acceptable? No. The religious employers, their employees do not get contraceptive coverage through the employer-based plan. I'm suggesting -- I'm asking whether there's any accommodation that would result in the women employees getting contraceptive coverage seamlessly through an employer-based plan that you would find acceptable. Well, what might be acceptable if it puts enough distance? ",well mr clement that might be so but what happen if somebody do just object to object it seem all your argument would apply the same way in other word somebody come in and say i do object to object because object will make it easy for the government to fill my slot that be a perfectly understandable thing to say and that be part of my sincere religious belief and you say the sincere religious belief be what control and there too it would seem under your very theory you would have to say that that be a substantial burden even if it be object to object yes yes i mean we have the same penalty that we have here and the person be just object to object and that be part of the religious belief because that will make it more likely that the government will be able to fill the slot and to take effort to you know to to provide contraceptive well it be a hypothetical that be directly implicate by your very theory of the case because your theory of the case say that everything depend on a person come in say this be against my religion and that be the end all and the be all you be just not answer the question so if i understand that answer it be that if a person have a sincere religious belief that object to object be a form of complicity then that would control and you would have to go to the second part of the analysis which be to say be there a compelling interest test have the government s response be narrowly tailor but essentially the object the difference between object to object and your client position be not a difference at all with respect to the burden analysis i guess what I be say mr clement be i understand the factual distinction that you be make but the factual distinction do not matter give your own legal analysis i think there be a a very strong tradition in this country which be that when it come to religious exercise church be special and that you know we have say this most recently in hosanna tabor but it be a long line of case which say that there be something very special about church themselves and and if you be say that every time congress give an exemption to church and synagogue and mosque that they have to open that up to all religious people then the effect of that be that congress just decide not to give an exemption at all and that be why there be some people who be extremely strong rfra supporter who have desert this because right here professor laycock among them because of the mortal danger that it pose to church mr francisco i have to admit to not quite understand this argument that it seem as though the most important law the law that serve the most compelling interest be often have exception in them there be often small business exception there be often transition rule like the grandfathering provision here and if every time that exist somebody could come in and say well the government must not really believe in this law because there be an exception to it state allow some people then i mean we might as well pack it all in there be not a law in town that do not have exception like that it be lower and low every single year here be the incentive that you would put in place mr francisco you would be say to congress congress next time you pass a law do not put in an exemption for church you be go to get in real trouble do that do not write transition rule that will help people adjust to a new legal regime you be go to get in real trouble do that do not write exemption for small business even though there be very particular concern that small business face you be go to get in trouble for that now those be terrible incentive to give to a legislature be they not mr francisco may may i ask a question be there any accomodation that the government would offer that would in fact result in woman employee of your client or student of your client get health care as part of an employer base plan or a student base plan get contraceptive coverage be there any accomodation that would be acceptable no no no through in other word be there be there any you object to this notification be there any kind of notification that would be acceptable no the religious employer their employee do not get contraceptive coverage through the employer base plan I be suggest I be ask whether there be any accommodation that would result in the woman employee get contraceptive coverage seamlessly through an employer base plan that you would find acceptable well what might be acceptable if it put enough distance ,294.9600000000001,Roberts Court,"Mar 23, 2016","David A.

2015,Montgomery v. Louisiana,114,Elena Kagan,"That's not what is happening here, Mr. Bernstein. I mean, if you assume the premise of Justice Breyer's question, which is that there is a Constitutional violation for keeping somebody in prison for some conduct that can't be criminalized. The State has set up a collateral review mechanism. We're not asking it to set up a new mechanism that it hasn't had before. It has a collateral review mechanism, and the only question is whether it's going to comply with Federal constitutional law in that collateral review mechanism. But Mr. Plaisance, I think what people are saying to you is that this is different from your standard Michigan v. Long question. It's a different question. It's a State that says we're not bound to follow Teague. We know we can do something different, but we want to follow Teague. That's what we want to do. And then in all its particulars. All right? And then the question is: If the State commits to following Teague, it's not -- it doesn't think anybody else has committed it. It self commits to following Teague and to following Federal law. Then what happens? Is there enough of a Federal question to decide this case? Now, that's not a Michigan v. Long question. It's more like a Merrell Dow question or something like that where Federal law is -- the State has chosen it, but it's just part and parcel of the claim, because the State is so committed to following Federal law in all its particulars. And Mr. Duncan, isn't it quite similar when Justice Scalia used this ""controlled"" language that the Louisiana Supreme Court has used similar language? It's dictated by Teague. Now, it's only dictated by Teague because they've chosen to make it dictated by Teague, but once that choice has been made, all outcomes are dictated by Teague. It's the same issue. Mr. Duncan -- -- can I give you just a hypothetical? I mean -- -- suppose that there is a State and it has a -- a mandatory minimum for a theft. It says the mandatory minimum for theft is 20 years. And suppose a court looks at that and says, you know what? That's incredibly disproportionate to a lot of theft, and so strikes the mandatory minimum. Says, you just can't have a mandatory minimum like that. Make it lower. Would that be a substantive ruling? It does not go to the manner of imposing. It says nothing about the manner of imposing. What it does is it just increases the range of sentencing possibilities. It actually leaves it to the -- to the courts. It says absolutely nothing about what factors ought to be taken into account. Nothing about that at all. All it says is, you can't have a mandatory minimum of 20 years for theft. Make it lower. But I think -- So if you're saying, no, that's different because there was something else in Miller. There is something else in Miller. There is a bunch. There -- there is -- there is a process component of Miller, no question about it, where the Court says what courts are supposed to look at is -- are the characteristics of youth and are supposed to try to figure out whether these terrible crimes are functions, in part, of immaturity or -- or -- or not, whether you -- you really are looking at an incorrigible defendant. So there is that process component. But that process component does not take away the fact that there is a completely separate, self-sufficient component as to what the range of punishment has to be. That's completely on all fours with the hypothetical that I gave you. No, you're exactly right. It did not take LWOP punishment off the table. But, similarly, in my hypothetical a 20-year sentence for theft has not been taken off the table. What the Court has done is to say, there have to be other options. There has to be an option of ten years or five years or two years -- whatever it is. So they've expanded the range of possibilities. They've just made the sentences different because the sentence is defined both by its upper end and by its lower end. So they made the sentence different. Mr. Duncan, I -- I -- I think not. I think by your own definition this fits on the substantive side. You said you -- you categorically remove a certain outcome. And -- and -- and that's exactly what Miller does. If you -- as long as you understand a sentence, which I think you agreed with, as defined both by its upper and -- and by its lower end, effectively what the Court said in Miller was that that sentence, which was the mandatory LWOP sentence, cannot control for juveniles. There has to be a different sentence. One that includes other punishments. That -- that increases the range. It allows something within the range, but it has -- it has completely changed the range that's -- that is -- that is given for any juvenile defendant. And the range is important. It's not just the top end. This is what we said in Alleyne, that you can't think about a sentence without thinking about both parts of the sentence, both the maximum and the minimum. And when you decide whether a substantive change in that sentence has been made, you look at both: the maximum and the minimum. But this is what we -- Which is what we said last year. We said, it's possible to disassociate the floor of a sentencing range from the penalty affixed to the crime. And similarly we said, criminal statutes have long specified both the floor and ceiling of sentencing ranges, which is evidence that both define the legally prescribed penalty. That is the penalty. Is the range. Well, but I think that you, yourself, cabined it when you said that the difference is one -- there is some category of cases that do refer to process, to how a decisionmaker makes a particular result, and another category of cases which refer to what we've called substance, which is what results are on the table, what category of punishment is on the table. And that's the difference between this and all the other kinds of things that you're mentioning. This is not about the how -- or it's partly about the how, but there's also about what punishments are on the table. ",that be not what be happen here mr bernstein i mean if you assume the premise of justice breyer s question which be that there be a constitutional violation for keep somebody in prison for some conduct that can not be criminalize the state have set up a collateral review mechanism we be not ask it to set up a new mechanism that it have not have before it have a collateral review mechanism and the only question be whether it be go to comply with federal constitutional law in that collateral review mechanism but mr plaisance i think what people be say to you be that this be different from your standard michigan v long question it be a different question it be a state that say we be not bind to follow teague we know we can do something different but we want to follow teague that be what we want to do and then in all its particular all right and then the question be if the state commits to follow teague it be not it do not think anybody else have commit it it self commit to follow teague and to follow federal law then what happen be there enough of a federal question to decide this case now that be not a michigan v long question it be more like a merrell dow question or something like that where federal law be the state have choose it but it be just part and parcel of the claim because the state be so committed to follow federal law in all its particular and mr duncan be not it quite similar when justice scalia use this control language that the louisiana supreme court have use similar language it be dictate by teague now it be only dictate by teague because they have choose to make it dictate by teague but once that choice have be make all outcome be dictate by teague it be the same issue mr duncan can i give you just a hypothetical i mean suppose that there be a state and it have a a mandatory minimum for a theft it say the mandatory minimum for theft be year and suppose a court look at that and say you know what that be incredibly disproportionate to a lot of theft and so strike the mandatory minimum say you just can not have a mandatory minimum like that make it low would that be a substantive ruling it do not go to the manner of imposing it say nothing about the manner of imposing what it do be it just increase the range of sentence possibility it actually leave it to the to the court it say absolutely nothing about what factor ought to be take into account nothing about that at all all it say be you can not have a mandatory minimum of year for theft make it low but i think so if you be say no that be different because there be something else in miller there be something else in miller there be a bunch there there be there be a process component of miller no question about it where the court say what court be suppose to look at be be the characteristic of youth and be suppose to try to figure out whether these terrible crime be function in part of immaturity or or or not whether you you really be look at an incorrigible defendant so there be that process component but that process component do not take away the fact that there be a completely separate self sufficient component as to what the range of punishment have

theft have not be take off the table what the court have do be to say there have to be other option there have to be an option of ten year or five year or two year whatever it be so they have expand the range of possibility they have just make the sentence different because the sentence be define both by its upper end and by its low end so they make the sentence different mr duncan i i i think not i think by your own definition this fit on the substantive side you say you you categorically remove a certain outcome and and and that be exactly what miller do if you as long as you understand a sentence which i think you agree with as define both by its upper and and by its low end effectively what the court say in miller be that that sentence which be the mandatory lwop sentence can not control for juvenile there have to be a different sentence one that include other punishment that that increase the range it allow something within the range but it have it have completely change the

that the difference be one there be some category of case that do refer to process to how a decisionmaker make a particular result and another category of case which refer to what we have call

2015,Molina-Martinez v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"But, Mr. Crooks, if I could take you back to your answer to Justice Kennedy. I take it that you don't need to use the word ""presumption,"" right? You're -- you're -- the burden that you have to carry in -- in a -- in plain-error review is you have to show a reasonable probability. And your argument would work just fine if you dropped the word ""presumption""; isn't that right? And you just said that the anchoring effect of the Guidelines creates a reasonable probability that the outcome would be different in a case in which the Court initially thought that the range was different from what it turned out to be. Sort of the end. Who needs the word ""presumption""? So I would think that the answer to Justice Kennedy's question is if the court of appeals really thinks it's not going to give relief because of the fourth prong, why would you bother remanding it? Why would -- why would the court of appeals bother remanding it? They could legitimately say it doesn't matter. We're not going to remand it because whatever happens on remand, we're not going to give relief based on the fourth prong. And if that's the case, why would the court of appeals remand it at all? But let's say that's right: Yes, the burden is on the defendant. But does the defendant meet that burden by saying, look, there was a mistake in the Guidelines; we know that there's an anchoring effect. That's what the Court said in Peugh. That anchoring effect creates a reasonable probability that the Court would have done something differently. Well, haven't we already answered that question in Peugh? In Peugh, the question was whether the likelihood was going to rise to the level of a significant risk. And we said yes. If you're using the wrong range, there is a significant risk that you would have made a different decision. So significant risk actually seems higher to me than reasonable probability. At least it's not demonstrably lower. So I would think that we've already said, if you're using the wrong range because of the anchoring effect of the range -- an anchoring effect that is kind of mandatory. It's -- you know, we say that these Guidelines are advisory, but we insist that a judge begin with them. So if you're using the wrong range, there is a significant risk. I would think so too, a reasonable -- of reasonable probability. Why -- why -- why is there a difference?

2015,Luna Torres v. Lynch,114,Elena Kagan,"What your -- What your theory does is at least create a world in which some things are included and some things are excluded in a way that appears not to make much sense. Now, you've said no, there is a reason for doing this with arson to limit it to the Federal offense. But I mean, there are a lot of things, a lot of things on that list that have jurisdictional hooks in them. So you would be excluding -- in addition to arson, you would be excluding the child pornography crime. You would be excluding a kidnapping crime, excluding felon and possession, excluding receiving explosives for the purpose of killing somebody. So you would be excluding all of those. And then on the other hand, you would be including some things that seem a lot more minor that just happen not to have jurisdictional hooks, like operating a gambling establishment. So you create a world in which the exclusions and the inclusions seem not to match up with anybody's view of -- of a sensible categorization. Mr. Guadagno, this is along the same lines as the Chief Justice's question. I mean, tell me if I'm wrong, but jurisdictional elements are different in one important way, which is we don't require mens rea as to jurisdictional elements. So that's a pretty critical distinction that we've made. Are you suggesting that jurisdictional elements are different? You know, you have to prove them, but you don't have to -- the -- the defendant doesn't have to have mens rea with respect to them. Why doesn't that suggest that there is a real distinction here between jurisdictional elements and substantive elements that can come into play in this context as well? But -- but that -- the mens rea example is also an example where we're basically stating what we think Congress meant. And we're saying, you know, Congress could not have meant to require mens rea for a jurisdictional element. Notwithstanding that there's not language in a statute that says, ""and there shall be no mens rea for a jurisdictional element."" So why not the same here? Is that really, Ms. Goldenberg, the only textual basis for your position? You know, your brief says a good deal about the difference between ""described"" and ""defined,"" which the Petitioner has suggested is -- is -- is not a very good distinction, because the ""defined"" only refers to actual statutory definitions. So are you still relying on that? Are you relying on anything else in the statutory text beyond the penultimate sentence, or is the penultimate sentence really the statutory basis for your argument? But I believe that Mr. Guadagno's point was that this is -- it's a reason why Congress may have used the language that it did, rather than, say, just arson. Right? That it wanted -- that it understood that there was a wealth of very minor arson crimes out there in the States, that it wanted to exclude those. And the way it excluded those was essentially by saying, no, it's got to be the Federal offense. Are there State or foreign RICO offenses at all? ",what your what your theory do be at least create a world in which some thing be include and some thing be exclude in a way that appear not to make much sense now you have say no there be a reason for do this with arson to limit it to the federal offense but i mean there be a lot of thing a lot of thing on that list that have jurisdictional hook in them so you would be exclude in addition to arson you would be exclude the child pornography crime you would be exclude a kidnapping crime exclude felon and possession exclude receive explosive for the purpose of kill somebody so you would be exclude all of those and then on the other hand you would be include some thing that seem a lot more minor that just happen not to have jurisdictional hook like operate a gambling establishment so you create a world in which the exclusion and the inclusion seem not to match up with anybody s view of of a sensible categorization mr guadagno this be along the same line as the chief justice s question i mean tell me if I be wrong but jurisdictional element be different in one important way which be we do not require men rea as to jurisdictional element so that be a pretty critical distinction that we have make be you suggest that jurisdictional element be different you know you have to prove them but you do not have to the the defendant do not have to have men rea with respect to them why do not that suggest that there be a real distinction here between jurisdictional element and substantive element that can come into play in this context as well but but that the men rea example be also an example where we be basically state what we think congress meant and we be say you know congress could not have mean to require men rea for a jurisdictional element notwithstanding that there be not language in a statute that say and there shall be no men rea for a jurisdictional element so why not the same here be that really ms goldenberg the only textual basis for your position you know your brief say a good deal about the difference between describe and define which the petitioner have suggest be be be not a very good distinction because the define only refer to actual statutory definition so be you still rely on that be you rely on anything else in the statutory text beyond the penultimate sentence or be the penultimate sentence really the statutory basis for your argument but i believe that mr guadagno s point be that this be it be a reason why congress may have use the language that it do rather than say just arson right that it want that it understand that there be a wealth of very minor arson crimes out there in the state that it want to exclude those and the way it exclude those be essentially by say no it be get to be the federal offense be there state or foreign rico offense at all ,181.52,Roberts Court,"Nov 3, 2015",Jorge Luna Torres,"Loretta E.

2015,"DIRECTV, Inc. v. Imburgia",114,Elena Kagan,"So, Mr. Landau, let's assume you're right, that this is a really bad mistake when it comes to arbitration. So just to take you back to Justice Alito's point and Justice Scalia's point, you know, usually we don't fix bad mistakes -- -- when State courts interpret State law. I mean, there are a lot of mistakes when it comes to interpretation of contracts, including arbitration agreements. So, again, what's the standard? There's nothing on the face of this opinion that indicates hostility to arbitration. To the extent that you can find reasoning in this opinion, which you have to search to find, but to the extent that you can find reasoning, it's about interpreting form contracts, interpreting -- whenever you see an ambiguity in a form contract, you interpret it against the drafter. And that's a principle of contract interpretation that, as far as I can see, has been used hundreds of times in California. It appears to be a very common principle of contract interpretation in California whenever California courts look at a contract of adhesion. So why isn't that just what they did, and is what they did? Mr. Landau, I completely take your point as to what the parties must have wanted, and it does make this State court opinion unsatisfying, would be a kind word for it, but -- but, you know, in fairness to the State court, part of the problem was the way this contract was worded. Everybody else finds ways to word contract provisions like this so that there isn't a problem. If the contract had said, you know, if class action waivers are invalid in your State, then Section 9 is unenforceable, there would have not have been this problem. This is -- it's a very unusual contract provision. Most companies use very clear ones. This one did not. And so the -- the State court had to sort of puzzle over what it meant and, as you say, probably got the answer wrong. Strike the ""probably."" Got the answer wrong. But, you know, wrongness is just not what we do here. But the -- Volt says the law of the place interprets the law of the place exactly in the way -- or allows that interpretation exactly in the way that this State court interpreted it. The law of the place was just the law of the State unmodified by any possibly preempting Federal law. I guess I just don't understand, then, Mr. Goldstein -- and maybe it's the same question that Justice Scalia asked -- I don't see why it's better somehow to discriminate against arbitration by declaring arbitration agreements unenforceable writ large than it is by narrowing the scope of arbitration agreements unfairly. Well, sure. The parties can do anything they want. But the question is, did the parties do what they want -- did the parties do that here? ",so mr landau let us assume you be right that this be a really bad mistake when it come to arbitration so just to take you back to justice alito s point and justice scalia s point you know usually we do not fix bad mistake when state court interpret state law i mean there be a lot of mistake when it come to interpretation of contract include arbitration agreement so again what be the standard there be nothing on the face of this opinion that indicate hostility to arbitration to the extent that you can find reasoning in this opinion which you have to search to find but to the extent that you can find reasoning it be about interpret form contract interpret whenever you see an ambiguity in a form contract you interpret it against the drafter and that be a principle of contract interpretation that as far as i can see have be use hundred of time in california it appear to be a very common principle of contract interpretation in california whenever california court look at a contract of adhesion so why be not that just what they do and be what they do mr landau i completely take your point as to what the party must have want and it do make this state court opinion unsatisfying would be a kind word for it but but you know in fairness to the state court part of the problem be the way this contract be word everybody else find way to word contract provision like this so that there be not a problem if the contract have say you know if class action waiver be invalid in your state then section be unenforceable there would have not have be this problem this be it be a very unusual contract provision most company use very clear one this one do not and so the the state court have to sort of puzzle over what it mean and as you say probably get the answer wrong strike the probably get the answer wrong but you know wrongness be just not what we do here but the volt say the law of the place interpret the law of the place exactly in the way or allow that interpretation exactly in the way that this state court interpret it the law of the place be just the law of the state unmodified by any possibly preempt federal law i guess i just do not understand then mr goldstein and maybe it be the same question that justice scalia ask i do not see why it be well somehow to discriminate against arbitration by declare arbitration agreement unenforceable writ large than it be by narrow the scope of arbitration agreement unfairly well sure the party can do anything they want but the question be do the party do what they want do the party do that here ,171.75000000000003,Roberts Court,"Oct 6, 2015","DIRECTV, Inc.","Amy Imburgia, et al.",14-462,"Mar 23, 2015","Dec 14, 2015",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

2015,OBB Personenverkehr AG v. Sachs,114,Elena Kagan,"Do -- do you think that it's the same test? In other words, is the test a specific jurisdiction test here, based-on, arising-from, that we are basically asking the same question as we would be asking if this were a -- a foreign corporation? Well, the why -- I mean, it doesn't seem to me that that wording is very different from the wording that we've used in specific jurisdiction cases. The wording here is ""based on"" -- we've used ""arising out of."" Sometimes we've used ""related to."" In some respects -- I mean, it's pretty clear that the FSIA is meant to ensure that when a foreign government is acting as a commercial actor, it gets treated like a foreign corporation. And the language here is very similar, right? There's the insistence on a sufficient contact, a minimum contact, and then there is the insistence on a particular kind of relationship between that contact -- contact and the claim. So it seems -- I guess the question is: Why should we think of these two questions as at all different? And I don't know, by the way, I mean, that it would hurt you if they were the same, because it might just be there would be no specific jurisdiction here, you know? But I guess I'm having trouble of thinking why it is that there -- that there would be a different test. Would -- would you agree and -- and, as you've been doing, take out the agency question -- but would you agree if -- if what had happened here was that the ticket was not honored. You know, the plaintiff bought a ticket, and the ticket was not honored, and -- and the suit was where the ticket was purchased, would you agree that that's based-on? Just a breach of contract case. In Austria, even though she bought the ticket in the United States? You think even the breach of contract case could not be brought in the United States? Could you go back and explain to me what -- I'm sorry. Because -- What about apart -- But not general jurisdiction. I was really talking about specific jurisdiction. And, of course, Justice Scalia is absolutely right with respect to general jurisdiction, that all you look at is the contacts. But with respect to specific jurisdiction -- this is a company that doesn't have pervasive contacts -- -- it's critical to the due process analysis that there be a relationship, and a real relationship between the particular contact with the United States and the lawsuit in the exact same way that this statute focuses on. And so, again, I don't know if it hurts you. It might be, as Justice Ginsburg says, that there wouldn't be specific jurisdiction here for a corporation. But -- but -- but why shouldn't we treat those two things exactly the same way? Yes. Well, that's an answer for why there is no specific jurisdiction here. And you can make the exact same answer in the completely private context. And you -- -- could well be right. I'm want to ask Mr. Fisher about that. But it's not an answer for why the tests should be different. Well, but how is based-upon different from the language we routinely use in specific jurisdiction cases? In other words, it just seems as though Congress, in line with its objective of treating foreign government engaging in commercial activity in the same way as they would be treated in the foreign corporations case, in line with that objective, used language that's virtually synonymous with the language that we use in specific jurisdiction cases. So Mr. -- In -- in my contract hypo, if the -- if the suit was a breach of contract action, do you think it would be based-upon? Just a straight, like, you don't -- you didn't honor my ticket? Mr. Kneedler, how about -- there is a contract claim in this lawsuit, so there is a -- is a kind of warranty of fitness kind of claim. How -- how about that? Why -- if you think that the -- let's assume that the contract claim, which is like you didn't honor my ticket, that there would be personal jurisdiction over, how do we separate out the warranty of habitability or fitness claim? Is -- is that a typical thing -- Is that a typical thing or an unusual thing to do in jurisdiction cases? In other words, to say, we're just not going to look at this claim by claim, we're going to ask about the whole gist of the lawsuit. No, but not for everything. I mean, let's assume this. Let's assume that I get a brochure from the Vienna Opera Company, and I send back the order form, I'd like to buy tickets, okay? Now, for sure, if the Vienna Opera Company refused to honor my tickets, I have a claim, and it arises out of the fact that they have marketed my tickets in the United States. But now they honor my tickets, and I go up the stairs, and I slip in a puddle, and I injure myself. What does that have to do with the only contact that they've in the United States? I mean, at that point, you're just saying it's a but-for test, and everything would be included. But I don't know of a sensible specific jurisdiction analysis that would -- that would run like that. Yes. But in point of fact, that's all OBB does. So, effectively, your argument is an argument that OBB is subject to jurisdiction in a general jurisdiction kind of way with respect to everything that they do. And, you know, I think what the Chief Justice is suggesting is, like, that seems wrong. Well, if -- But if that's true -- If that's true, I don't understand why you answered my hypothetical question the way you did, because in my hypothetical question I thought you said that there would not be jurisdiction to sue in the United States when I slip and fall in Vienna. And -- but you could make the same argument. Well, there was a duty created in the United States, and that's what I'm suing on. Well, there's -- I mean, the only thing that's happened in the United States is that I've purchased a ticket there. That's -- that's what I've done. So I take it that your argument is that purchase of a ticket gives rise to a duty which is then violated when I slip and fall in another country. But you also have to have a relationship. Well, let's say that I don't accept that argument, okay? Let's just for a moment assume that on a straight negligence claim, the idea that a negligence claim arising from an accident in Austria arises -- let's say I think it arises from the accident in Austria. It does not arise from the purchase of a ticket in the United States, okay? Now, I guess there's still a question as to whether your warranty claims ought to be treated differently. And I take it what Mr. Kneedler has said about that is, no, they shouldn't be, that's just fancy pleading, it's just a way of converting a negligence claim into a contract claim. It's the same kind of thing that happened in Nelson that we refused to allow. Why isn't that right? ",do do you think that it be the same test in other word be the test a specific jurisdiction test here base on arise from that we be basically ask the same question as we would be ask if this we be a a foreign corporation well the why i mean it do not seem to me that that wording be very different from the wording that we have use in specific jurisdiction case the wording here be base on we have use arise out of sometimes we have use related to in some respect i mean it be pretty clear that the fsia be mean to ensure that when a foreign government be act as a commercial actor it get treat like a foreign corporation and the language here be very similar right there be the insistence on a sufficient contact a minimum contact and then there be the insistence on a particular kind of relationship between that contact contact and the claim so it seem i guess the question be why should we think of these two question as at all different and i do not know by the way i mean that it would hurt you if they we be the same because it might just be there would be no specific jurisdiction here you know but i guess I be have trouble of think why it be that there that there would be a different test would would you agree and and as you have be do take out the agency question but would you agree if if what have happen here be that the ticket be not honor you know the plaintiff buy a ticket and the ticket be not honor and and the suit be where the ticket be purchase would you agree that that be base on just a breach of contract case in austria even though she buy the ticket in the united state you think even the breach of contract case could not be bring in the united state could you go back and explain to me what I be sorry because what about apart but not general jurisdiction i be really talk about specific jurisdiction and of course justice scalia be absolutely right with respect to general jurisdiction that all you look at be the contact but with respect to specific jurisdiction this be a company that do not have pervasive contact it be critical to the due process analysis that there be a relationship and a real relationship between the particular contact with the united state and the lawsuit in the exact same way that this statute focus on and so again i do not know if it hurt you it might be as justice ginsburg say that there would not be specific jurisdiction here for a corporation but but but why should not we treat those two thing exactly the same way yes well that be an answer for why there be no specific jurisdiction here and you can make the exact same answer in the completely private context and you could well be right I be want to ask mr fisher about that but it be not an answer for why the test should be different well but how be base upon different from the language we routinely use in specific jurisdiction case in other word it just seem as though congress in line with its objective of treat foreign government engage in commercial activity in the same way as they would be treat in the foreign corporation case in line with that objective use language that be virtually synonymous with the language that we use in specific jurisdiction case so mr in in my contract hypo if the if the suit be a breach of contract action do you think it would be base upon just a straight like you do not you do not honor my ticket mr kneedler how about there be a contract claim in this lawsuit so there be a be a kind of warranty of fitness kind of claim how how about that why if you think that the let us assume that the contract claim which be like you do not honor my ticket that there would be personal jurisdiction over how do we separate out the warranty of habitability or fitness claim be be that a typical thing be that a typical thing or an unusual thing to do in jurisdiction case in other word to say we be just not go to look at this claim by claim we be go to ask about the whole gist of the lawsuit no but not for everything i mean let us assume this let us assume that i get a brochure from the vienna opera company and i send back the order form I would like to buy ticket okay now for sure if the vienna opera company refuse to honor my ticket i have a claim and it arise out of the fact that they have market my ticket in the united state but now they honor my ticket and i go up the stair and i slip in a puddle and i injure myself what do that have to do with the only contact that they have in the united state i mean at that point you be just say it be a but for test and everything would be include but i do not know of a sensible specific jurisdiction analysis that would that would run like that yes but in point of fact that be all obb do so effectively your argument be an argument that obb be subject to jurisdiction in a general jurisdiction kind of way with respect to everything that they do and you know i think what the chief justice be suggest be like that seem wrong well if but if that be true if that be true i do not understand why you answer my hypothetical question the way you do because in my hypothetical question i think you say that there would not be jurisdiction to sue in the united state when i slip and fall in vienna and but you could make the same argument well there be a duty create in the united state and that be what I be sue on well there be i mean the only thing that be happen in the united state be that I have purchase a ticket there that be that be what I have do so i take it that your argument be that purchase of a ticket give rise to a duty which be then violate when i slip and fall in another country but you also have to have a relationship well let us say that i do not accept that argument okay let us just for a moment assume that on a straight negligence claim the idea that a negligence claim arise from an accident in austria arises let us say i think it arise from the accident in austria it do not arise from the purchase of a ticket in the united state okay now i guess there be still a question as to whether your warranty claim ought to be treat differently and i take it what mr kneedler have say about that be no they should not be that be just fancy pleading it be just a way of convert a negligence claim into a contract claim it be the same kind of thing that happen in nelson that we refuse to allow why be not that right

2015,Franchise Tax Board of California v. Hyatt,114,Elena Kagan,"There is one -- There's one -- there's one significant difference there, Mr. Clement, which is that States are on a par with each other. So there's a kind of mutuality. So if one State does something to you that you don't like, you can turn it around and do it to them. And that mutuality also makes it less likely that the State will do that thing to you in the first place because they know that. So -- so I think what Mr. Farr says is the fact that there was this outrage with respect to a Federal court might not have registered in quite the same way when States were aware that they were on a par with each other and that they had many weapons that they could use against each other. Well, for sure, Mr. -- Mr. Clement, you know, you couldn't go to war with the neighboring State anymore, and that's a difference. But you could say, if you're going to treat me like that, I'm going to treat you like that. And -- and you have other ways of dealing with -- with a State that you wouldn't have with the Federal government. But -- but that does raise -- But, Mr. Clement, Justice Scalia's question does suggest that there are sovereign interests on both sides of this. Right? There's -- one is I want to have sovereign immunity. I want to avail myself of sovereign immunity. And the other is I want to subject another State to my court system when I feel like it, and I want the choice of doing that or reaching an agreement with another State that we should all treat each other nicely. So on your view, the States are giving up some significant sovereignty interest. They're keeping one, but they're also giving up one. And the question that you have to answer is why -- why is it so obvious that the States would have made that choice rather than the other choice? Which is, hey, it's been working out for us just fine to have the choice and to deal with our States on a going-forward basis on principles of mutuality. Well, I think Mr. Clement says that there are two answers to that. One is that they actually never exercised that sovereign interest, so it didn't mean very much to them. And the other is that in exercising that sovereign interest, they would be violating norms of international law, so that they wouldn't have really thought that that was a significant and exercisable interest. But those are his two arguments against that. So Mr. Farr, Mr. Clement suggests that it's unthinkable that a State would be so concerned about being haled into Federal court but not just as concerned or even more so about being haled into suit of another State. What is the response to that? Mr. -- You know, can I just ask you to -- On that last point -- I think this is a very hard case straight up. But it's not straight up, right? You need a special justification on your side. So what is your special justification? ",there be one there be one there be one significant difference there mr clement which be that state be on a par with each other so there be a kind of mutuality so if one state do something to you that you do not like you can turn it around and do it to them and that mutuality also make it less likely that the state will do that thing to you in the first place because they know that so so i think what mr farr say be the fact that there be this outrage with respect to a federal court might not have register in quite the same way when state we be aware that they we be on a par with each other and that they have many weapon that they could use against each other well for sure mr mr clement you know you could not go to war with the neighbor state anymore and that be a difference but you could say if you be go to treat me like that I be go to treat you like that and and you have other way of deal with with a state that you would not have with the federal government but but that do raise but mr clement justice scalia s question do suggest that there be sovereign interest on both side of this right there be one be i want to have sovereign immunity i want to avail myself of sovereign immunity and the other be i want to subject another state to my court system when i feel like it and i want the choice of do that or reach an agreement with another state that we should all treat each other nicely so on your view the state be give up some significant sovereignty interest they be keep one but they be also give up one and the question that you have to answer be why why be it so obvious that the state would have make that choice rather than the other choice which be hey it be be work out for us just fine to have the choice and to deal with our state on a go forward basis on principle of mutuality well i think mr clement say that there be two answer to that one be that they actually never exercise that sovereign interest so it do not mean very much to them and the other be that in exercise that sovereign interest they would be violate norm of international law so that they would not have really think that that be a significant and exercisable interest but those be his two argument against that so mr farr mr clement suggest that it be unthinkable that a state would be so concerned about be hale into federal court but not just as concerned or even more so about be hale into suit of another state what be the response to that mr you know can i just ask you to on that last point i think this be a very hard case straight up but it be not straight up right you need a special justification on your side so what be your special justification ,172.36999999999995,Roberts Court,"Dec 7, 2015",Franchise Tax Board of California,Gilbert P.

2015,Heffernan v. City of Paterson,114,Elena Kagan,"So just to make sure I understand what you're saying, suppose there's somebody who comes into office, and it's a Democrat. And he says I want as many Democrats as possible in my office, no matter what jobs they're doing. Now, what you're saying is he can't demote or fire Republicans. He can't remove, demote, or fire people who have other political views, neither Democrat or Republican. But what he can do is he can get rid of anybody who is just politically apathetic. Is that your view? See, I -- See, I had always thought that the -- the idea behind those cases is a different one. That the idea has to do with why the government acted. And once we say that the government acted for an impermissible purpose, which is to -- let's say in my hypothetical, get as many Democrats as possible into the government, once we say that's an impermissible purpose, it matters not at all whether the person is a Republican, an -- an independent, or somebody who has never thought about politics in his life, because the government is acting in a way that's wrongful, irrespective of that. So does that mean that the government can compel speech of a person if the person really just doesn't care one way or the other? I guess I'm not sure how that works. It just seems to break down very easily, if you can't have a broad rule that says that you can fire everybody but Democrats. But you're saying that you are going to allow somebody to come in and fire people one at a time. But you're saying -- and -- and I think you said this straight out -- you're saying I can come into an office -- I'm a Democrat. I can -- I can identify every person without a well-known political view, every couch potato out there, just fire one after another, after another, after another. Replace them all with Democrats, change the entire character of the office, do it for a reason that I prefer one political view to any other, and that that will not be a violation of the First Amendment. See, I had always thought that the First Amendment running through all our cases is an extremely strong strand. That part of the reason we have these protections is because we worry the government is doing things for impermissible reasons. That the government wants to create a world of speech in which everybody agrees with it and nobody opposes it. And that's a fundamental tenet of what the First Amendment and all our cases are about. And you're saying, oh, no. The government's motive doesn't really matter as long as you can't point to somebody who is holding up a sign. And the -- (Laughter.) Well -- Mr. Goldstein, I mean, if somebody had come in to me before today's argument and just said, does the First Amendment prevent the government from punishing a person because that person does not share the government's views, I would have said, why, yes, of course the First Amendment protects that. That's the whole point of the First Amendment. And now you're telling me, no, the First Amendment does not prevent the government from punishing a person because that person doesn't share the government's views, unless that person is actively opposed to the government's views. But if that person just really could not care less, which a lot of people in this country could not care less; they don't vote, they don't pay attention, they wouldn't know who was running. But the government can punish that person because that person doesn't share the government's views. And I would have said, that is one strange doctrine. ",so just to make sure i understand what you be say suppose there be somebody who come into office and it be a democrat and he say i want as many democrat as possible in my office no matter what job they be do now what you be say be he can not demote or fire republican he can not remove demote or fire people who have other political view neither democrat or republican but what he can do be he can get rid of anybody who be just politically apathetic be that your view see i see i have always think that the the idea behind those case be a different one that the idea have to do with why the government act and once we say that the government act for an impermissible purpose which be to let us say in my hypothetical get as many democrat as possible into the government once we say that be an impermissible purpose it matter not at all whether the person be a republican an an independent or somebody who have never think about politics in his life because the government be act in a way that be wrongful irrespective of that so do that mean that the government can compel speech of a person if the person really just do not care one way or the other i guess I be not sure how that work it just seem to break down very easily if you can not have a broad rule that say that you can fire everybody but democrat but you be say that you be go to allow somebody to come in and fire people one at a time but you be say and and i think you say this straight out you be say i can come into an office I be a democrat i can i can identify every person without a well know political view every couch potato out there just fire one after another after another after another replace them all with democrat change the entire character of the office do it for a reason that i prefer one political view to any other and that that will not be a violation of the first amendment see i have always think that the first amendment run through all our case be an extremely strong strand that part of the reason we have these protection be because we worry the government be do thing for impermissible reason that the government want to create a world of speech in which everybody agree with it and nobody oppose it and that be a fundamental tenet of what the first amendment and all our case be about and you be say oh no the government s motive do not really matter as long as you can not point to somebody who be hold up a sign and the laughter well mr goldstein i mean if somebody have come in to me before today s argument and just say do the first amendment prevent the government from punish a person because that person do not share the government s view i would have say why yes of course the first amendment protect that that be the whole point of the first amendment and now you be tell me no the first amendment do not prevent the government from punish a person because that person do not share the government s view unless that person be actively oppose to the government s view but if that person just really could not care less which a lot of people in this country could not care less they do not vote they do not pay attention they would not know who be run but the government can punish that person because that person do not share the government s view and i would have say that be one strange doctrine ,212.81,Roberts Court,"Jan 19, 2016",Jeffrey Heffernan,City of Paterson,14-1280,"Oct 1, 2015","Apr 26, 2016",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2015,"Hughes v. Talen Energy Marketing, LLC",114,Elena Kagan,"I'm not sure why it is that when you say it was subject to FERC's jurisdiction, that doesn't end the case right there against you, because if it's subject to FERC's jurisdiction, that means it's a wholesale sale. And that's for FERC to do is to set the rates and other terms of wholesale sales, and that's not for the States to do. So that means you're preempted. Are you saying that Maryland didn't set the rates just because they use an auction? Is that what you're saying? That's true of FERC itself. FERC doesn't set rates anymore, either. It allows an auction to set rates, but we would never say that that doesn't mean that they are FERC rates, that they are FERC-approved rates. And so here, the fact that Maryland decided not to set rates directly but to allow an auction to do it, I mean, that's just a mechanism that Maryland chose. They are still Maryland's rates. Mr. Strauss -- If I understand what you just said, you're not relying on Mr. Strauss's argument. Mr. Strauss said that this wasn't a -- setting a wholesale rate because Maryland did it by auction. But you're saying that's irrelevant; that Maryland could have just picked a price, and -- and that that would have been fine so long as at some point FERC had the power to review and veto it. Is that what you're saying? Well -- I guess I -- -- I don't understand that. I mean, just take a hypothetical case where -- where Maryland said to all its utilities, this is the price and this is the only price that you will pay for electricity. Are you -- are you saying that -- -- Maryland could do that? Okay. Then you are saying that everything's dependent on the difference between picking a price and letting an auction pick a price. But I guess I -- I'll repeat the question that I made to -- to Mr. Strauss. I mean, we know that one of the ways that you pick a price is by letting an auction determine that price. That's exactly what FERC does. Mr. Clement, it -- it does seem to me important what the kind of State action is. And this goes back to the question that the Chief Justice raised with you. If the State had just said we need another power plant and had delivered a load of money to CPV and said go build a power plant, you're not saying that that would be preempted, are you? If it's not at all, it -- it -- you know, that's going to have an effect on the kind of bids that CPV is going to make. But the State is not itself changing the outcomes of the auction process. You wouldn't say that's preempted, would you? Ms. O'Connell, you -- you have both arguments field and conflict. If -- if you were to win this case, would you rather win it on field or conflict? (Laughter.) And why? Well, why do you even need the sort of change-in-incentives language? Why isn't the field preemption argument more that this -- this -- this scheme essentially takes the rate that the auction produces and changes that rate for CPV and for all the utilities in Maryland? No, but that's -- but that's -- when Mr. Clement said that there's a real difference here between voluntary agreements -- you know, if there's a contract for differences, fine, but that this is Maryland coming in and effectively forcing the LSCs to enter into such a contract, and by doing so, changing the wholesale rate. See, when we -- Well, but I don't see how that could be true. If FERC could, in fact, get rid of the problem, then it leaves you with no conflict. ",I be not sure why it be that when you say it be subject to ferc s jurisdiction that do not end the case right there against you because if it be subject to ferc s jurisdiction that mean it be a wholesale sale and that be for ferc to do be to set the rate and other term of wholesale sale and that be not for the state to do so that mean you be preempt be you say that maryland do not set the rate just because they use an auction be that what you be say that be true of ferc itself ferc do not set rate anymore either it allow an auction to set rate but we would never say that that do not mean that they be ferc rate that they be ferc approve rate and so here the fact that maryland decide not to set rate directly but to allow an auction to do it i mean that be just a mechanism that maryland choose they be still maryland s rate mr strauss if i understand what you just say you be not rely on mr strauss s argument mr strauss say that this be not a set a wholesale rate because maryland do it by auction but you be say that be irrelevant that maryland could have just pick a price and and that that would have be fine so long as at some point ferc have the power to review and veto it be that what you be say well i guess i i do not understand that i mean just take a hypothetical case where where maryland say to all its utility this be the price and this be the only price that you will pay for electricity be you be you say that maryland could do that okay then you be say that everything s dependent on the difference between pick a price and let an auction pick a price but i guess i I will repeat the question that i make to to mr strauss i mean we know that one of the way that you pick a price be by let an auction determine that price that be exactly what ferc do mr clement it it do seem to me important what the kind of state action be and this go back to the question that the chief justice raise with you if the state have just say we need another power plant and have deliver a load of money to cpv and say go build a power plant you be not say that that would be preempt be you if it be not at all it it you know that be go to have an effect on the kind of bid that cpv be go to make but the state be not itself change the outcome of the auction process you would not say that be preempt would you ms oconnell you you have both argument field and conflict if if you we be to win this case would you rather win it on field or conflict laughter and why well why do you even need the sort of change in incentive language why be not the field preemption argument more that this this this scheme essentially take the rate that the auction produce and change that rate for cpv and for all the utility in maryland no but that be but that be when mr clement say that there be a real difference here between voluntary agreement you know if there be a contract for difference fine but that this be maryland come in and effectively force the lscs to enter into such a contract and by do so change the wholesale rate see when we well but i do not see how that could be true if ferc could in fact get rid of the problem then it leave you with no conflict ,206.65,Roberts Court,"Feb 24, 2016","W.

2015,Halo Electronics v. Pulse Electronics Inc.,114,Elena Kagan,"Can I ask -- Besides the -- if you were doing this just on policy -- very odd, but you know, we have a test that everybody's off of at this point. And -- and maybe some viewed that what happened in 1952, for some of the reasons that Justice Breyer gave, is perhaps not the most relevant thing. If you were doing it just on policy, would you come up with this same test? But I don't know how far that gets you, Mr. Phillips, because Mr. Martinez just told us that he'd be happy to call willfulness his test. And willfulness has meant different things to different people here. And there's nothing that Congress did that suggests that, when it used that word ""willfulness,"" it really meant the Seagate test. No. But take a case where -- take a case where there's somebody who absolutely wants to copy a product. He says, Mr. Jones -- A patented product. All right? So same thing, let's call it. Mr. Jones sells a product that involves a patent, and it's selling very well. And Mr. Smith comes along and says I want to copy that patent and that product and sell the same thing so that I can reap those profits too, and -- and does that. Now, the Seagate's test says that as long as his lawyer can come along at the end and raise some kind of doubt about the patent's validity, the fact that -- I forget whether it was Mr. Smith or Mr. Jones -- but the fact that -- The fact that he went and said I am going to copy this patent so that I can reap the benefits of some other person's work, that doesn't make a difference. And that's, I think, the question that Justice Kennedy was asking. It seems to stick in the craw a bit. Right. But that's not enough. Because, you know, if I'm Mr. Jones and I'm saying is it worth my while to go copy this patent, and I think, you know what? A lot of patents are not valid. I'll take this risk. I will -- I will make a lot of money selling this patented product, and if somebody calls me on it, I'll go hire myself a lawyer, and that lawyer will come up with some kind of argument about why the patent is not valid after all.

2015,"Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins",114,Elena Kagan,"Why is it you think -- Let's say I agree with you that there needs to be a concrete injury; that Congress needs to have recognized something that looks like a concrete injury. But why isn't that exactly what Congress did here? So let me just frame it in a hypothetical. Suppose that there's just a statute -- it's a little bit of a simpler statute, and you can argue with me or tell me why it might or might not be different, but I just want to understand your position. Suppose that there is a statute that just says that one of these credit reporting agencies shall not disseminate inaccurate information about people, or shall -- shall not do it willfully or negligently or what have you, but shall not disseminate inaccurate information about people. And then there's a cause of action that says if they disseminate inaccurate information in a credit report about you, you can sue. All right? Is that enough of a concrete injury for you? Okay. But let me focus on what seems to be -- -- the gravamen of the claim. And why isn't the dissemination of false information about you in a credit report, why isn't that -- why isn't it -- it perfectly sufficient if Congress says that's a concrete injury? I'm sorry. You said that there were reasons why that was not a concrete injury -- -- the dissemination of false information about a particular person. Why? Because to me, I'll just say, seems like a concrete injury to me. You know? If -- I mean, if somebody did it to me I'd feel harmed. And I think that if you went out on the street and you did a survey, most people would feel harmed. Most people would feel as though they had some interest that had been invaded. And Congress recognized that, thought it was a significant problem, passed a statute to deal with that problem. That's quite right. It's not -- it's not completely in the common law tradition. But we've said many times that Congress gets to look beyond the common law tradition and gets to identify real world problems out there in the world, harming people in real-world ways. And that, it seems, is what Congress did here. These are not -- these -- these are not unimportant details. This is a -- they basically got everything wrong about him. You know, they got his marital status wrong, they got his income wrong, they got his education wrong. They basically portrayed a different person than -- Here's the thing, Mr. Pincus. It seems to me that the -- the one thing that we have to say Congress is better at than we are is identifying concrete harms. I mean, it's perfectly fine, and I agree with very large portions of your brief when you say they have to have identified a concrete harm. It's like, fine, yes, they do. But now the question is, did they identify one? And it seems pretty clear what they wanted to do here; that this statute is entirely about preventing the dissemination of inaccurate information in credit reports which they seem to think is both something that harms the individual personally and also harms larger systemic issues. And then they gave the cause of action to the people it harmed personally. And I guess -- I mean, don't we owe them a little bit of respect that they've actually identified a real-world harm that it -- that's out there? But that's a really hard thing to do, Mr. Pincus. People get these reports, and you don't know what they're doing with these reports. They might have not given you a job for that reason, or they might have not given you a job for some other reason. They might have not given you credit for that reason, or they might have not given you credit for some other reason. I mean, it's actually the quintessential kind of injury that you will never be able to detect and surely not to prove. No. Well, I agree with you entirely on that. Go ahead. Congress does it by doing it, you know? Congress doesn't announce exactly -- -- here we are, we're just going beyond the common law. It just does it. And -- and it does it -- and it did it here. It said, you know, what are we concerned about? We're concerned about following the kinds of procedures that will make sure that there are accurate credit reports. And then Congress told you exactly why in the purposes section of the statute. And my gosh, it's all over the legislative history. The most serious problem in the credit reporting industry, Congress says, is the problem of inaccurate and misleading information. And -- and so Congress has clearly done that here. And I guess I -- if you want to just explain to me why it is that Congress can't do -- I think we've said that Congress can do that, can go beyond the common law, and certainly can go beyond anything that we've ever said is a concrete harm as long as they've identified a concrete harm. Of course, harms can arise in the world, and can be identified in the world even though they haven't arisen before, or been identified before. If you're saying that, I agree with you. But why did Congress do that, Mr. Pincus? Congress did that -- -- Congress did that as a safe harbor. We are not -- it's a kind of industry-friendly act that Congress did. It said we're not going to punish any old inaccuracy. We're giving you a safe harbor. If -- as long as you followed a certain set of procedures, don't worry about it. But did that procedural requirement -- this is -- this is exactly what Lujan says, ""It's a procedural requirement, the disregard of which could impair a concrete interest of the plaintiff."" And we distinguished that from procedural requirements in vacuo. And that's what this is. It's a procedural requirement, the disregard of which can impair your interest in being represented accurately in credit reports. No. Well, but, Mr. Pincus, the gravamen of this claim, as I said, and as more importantly, as -- as the -- the Respondent has said, is in 1681(e), which does talk about accuracy. And it makes it clear that the procedures are linked to accuracy. And I totally take your point that, well, how about the person who there's -- there's been no inaccuracy. Well, that person does not have standing. That person cannot come in and say that he's suffered a concrete injury. But the person who has been inaccurately represented can come in and say he's suffered exactly the concrete injury that this statute is designed to protect against. Well, was this -- Yes. No. But would this man be able? I mean, this is very much in line with the Chief Justice's. Would he be able to sue based on the fact that there was inaccurate information about him? I guess -- I guess what I -- that's okay. That's -- -- that -- that's -- Mr. Consovoy, can I just make sure I understand? You said you -- you need for the information to be inaccurate to have standing here. That is going to mean that the class, as you've defined it, is not going to be certified. And I think that that's the right answer, but I just want to make sure that we're on the -- we're on the same page here. And one very quick thing. You said in your brief you're really only suing under 1681(e)(B). Can I understand that to be that you're waiving all claims of other things? And -- and Mr. Stewart, if I could just -- I mean, the -- maybe this is the sentence that you're talking about. At one point the Court says, ""the interests protected by the statutory rights at issue are sufficiently concrete and particularized."" Now, look, it's not a good opinion, and then it doesn't tell you why it is that they're sufficiently concrete. But they clearly held that they were sufficiently concrete. They understood that as part of the test. ",why be it you think let us say i agree with you that there need to be a concrete injury that congress need to have recognize something that look like a concrete injury but why be not that exactly what congress do here so let me just frame it in a hypothetical suppose that there be just a statute it be a little bit of a simpler statute and you can argue with me or tell me why it might or might not be different but i just want to understand your position suppose that there be a statute that just say that one of these credit reporting agency shall not disseminate inaccurate information about people or shall shall not do it willfully or negligently or what have you but shall not disseminate inaccurate information about people and then there be a because of action that say if they disseminate inaccurate information in a credit report about you you can sue all right be that enough of a concrete injury for you okay but let me focus on what seem to be the gravamen of the claim and why be not the dissemination of false information about you in a credit report why be not that why be not it it perfectly sufficient if congress say that be a concrete injury I be sorry you say that there we be reason why that be not a concrete injury the dissemination of false information about a particular person why because to me I will just say seem like a concrete injury to me you know if i mean if somebody do it to me I would feel harm and i think that if you go out on the street and you do a survey most people would feel harm most people would feel as though they have some interest that have be invade and congress recognize that think it be a significant problem pass a statute to deal with that problem that be quite right it be not it be not completely in the common law tradition but we have say many time that congress get to look beyond the common law tradition and get to identify real world problem out there in the world harm people in real world way and that it seem be what congress do here these be not these these be not unimportant detail this be a they basically get everything wrong about him you know they get his marital status wrong they get his income wrong they get his education wrong they basically portray a different person than here s the thing mr pincus it seem to me that the the one thing that we have to say congress be well at than we be be identify concrete harm i mean it be perfectly fine and i agree with very large portion of your brief when you say they have to have identify a concrete harm it be like fine yes they do but now the question be do they identify one and it seem pretty clear what they want to do here that this statute be entirely about prevent the dissemination of inaccurate information in credit report which they seem to think be both something that harm the individual personally and also harm large systemic issue and then they give the because of action to the people it harm personally and i guess i mean do not we owe them a little bit of respect that they have actually identify a real world harm that it that be out there but that be a really hard thing to do mr pincus people get these report and you do not know what they be do with these report they might have not give you a job for that reason or they might have not give you a job for some other reason they might have not give you credit for that reason or they might have not give you credit for some other reason i mean it be actually the quintessential kind of injury that you will never be able to detect and surely not to prove no well i agree with you entirely on that go ahead congress do it by do it you know congress do not announce exactly here we be we be just go beyond the common law it just do it and and it do it and it do it here it say you know what be we concerned about we be concern about follow the kind of procedure that will make sure that there be accurate credit report and then congress tell you exactly why in the purpose section of the statute and my gosh it be all over the legislative history the most serious problem in the credit reporting industry congress say be the problem of inaccurate and misleading

the common law and certainly can go beyond anything that we have ever say be a concrete harm as long as they have identify a concrete harm of course harm can arise in the world and can be identify in the world even though they have not arise before or be identify before if you be say that i agree with you but why do congress do that mr pincus congress do that congress do that as a safe harbor we be not it be a kind of industry friendly act that congress do it say we be not go to punish any old inaccuracy we be give you a safe harbor if as long as you follow a certain set of procedure do not worry about it but do that procedural requirement this be this be exactly what lujan say it be a procedural requirement the disregard of which could impair a concrete interest of the plaintiff and we distinguish that from procedural requirement in vacuo and that be what this be it be a procedural requirement the disregard of which can impair your interest in be represent accurately in credit report no well but mr pincus the gravamen of this claim as i say and as more importantly as as the the respondent have say be in e which do talk about accuracy and it make it clear that the procedure be link to accuracy and i totally take your point that well how about the person who there be there be be no inaccuracy well that person do not have standing that person can not come in and say that he be suffer a concrete injury but the person who have be inaccurately represent can come in and say he be suffer exactly the concrete injury that this statute be design to protect against well be this yes no but would this man be able i mean this be very much in line with the chief justice s would he be able to sue base on the fact that there be inaccurate information about him i guess i guess

you have define it be not go to be certify and i think that that be the right answer but i just want to make sure that we be on the we be on the same page here and one very quick thing you say in your brief you be really only sue under e b can i understand that to be that you be waive all claim of other thing and and mr stewart if i could just i mean the maybe this be the sentence that you be talk about at one point the court say the interest protect by the statutory right at issue be sufficiently concrete and particularized now look it be not a good opinion and then it do not tell you why it

2015,CRST Van Expedited v. EEOC,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Smith, understanding that you think that, but if we could just go on from that, what is wrong with that position? And do you have a substitute test, or -- or is there no substitute test, in your view? Right. Let's just assume that it were. Even if the -- even if the reason for the dismissal -- for the dismissal is completely curable? But -- but then you're suggesting that whatever the reason for the dismissal is, with prejudice, without prejudice, for any reason whatsoever, curable or not, it's up to the discretion of the Court? Mr. Smith, do you understand her order as -- as saying that if the EEOC did engage in conciliation, had made the initial findings, had satisfied all the pre-suit requirements, could the EEOC, do you think, have come back and brought those individual claims? Even after filing the pre-suit requirements? Even after satisfying the pre-suit requirements? Why didn't she say ""with prejudice,"" then? But back in 2009, she didn't say that. So why didn't she say that? You had asked for the case, the -- all of them to be dismissed with -- with prejudice. She did not include that language. But if I understand, their motion did not say now we've satisfied all our pre-suit requirements, right? So she might just have said, well, you still haven't satisfied your pre-suit requirements, so of course I'm not changing anything. The question is what would have happened if the government came back and said we have satisfied the pre-suit requirements. Would she then have thought, okay, well, that's a different story now. I didn't -- I didn't dismiss these with prejudice. Now that the government has satisfied the pre-suit requirements, it can go ahead. All the claims that were then being litigated by the EEOC, which did not include the claims that had previously been dismissed for failure to satisfy the pre-suit requirements. I think that's not -- it's not right, if the prior ruling was based on a curable dismissal and the EEOC had simply done nothing with respect to that set of claims, neither cured it nor renounced the possibility that they would cure it. In 2013, the court was facing a much reduced set of claims in a different suit. Mr. Smith, do you think it's possible to have a pattern of practice appropriate class claim with respect to sexual harassment? Mr. Fletcher, could I -- could I take you back to where you started, which is whether you've waived all of this? And, you know, you point out that the question presented includes your argument, but clearly it is, as you say, a different argument from the one you litigated below, both in the district court and in the circuit court. And in the bio that you filed here. And Mr. Smith has responded to this new argument in less than a page, which is really his every right to do, given that it has sort of sprung from your head at this late date. And I'm wondering why we shouldn't just ignore the whole thing. Well, you can always file a footnote, you know? I mean -- Well, regardless of whether there's blame on either part, we're still in a situation where it really has not been briefed by one party, and it hasn't been thought about by the courts below. And usually, you know, we do that -- we're a court of review, not a first view, mine, and we would kick it back. That seems even worse. I mean, nobody has thought about that. It seems to be a complicated factual scenario, you know. There are circumstances in which you could proceed with a class properly and circumstances in which you couldn't, and we know nothing about whether this is the circumstances, one or the other. ",mr smith understand that you think that but if we could just go on from that what be wrong with that position and do you have a substitute test or or be there no substitute test in your view right let us just assume that it we be even if the even if the reason for the dismissal for the dismissal be completely curable but but then you be suggest that whatever the reason for the dismissal be with prejudice without prejudice for any reason whatsoever curable or not it be up to the discretion of the court mr smith do you understand her order as as say that if the eeoc do engage in conciliation have make the initial finding have satisfy all the pre suit requirement could the eeoc do you think have come back and bring those individual claim even after file the pre suit requirement even after satisfy the pre suit requirement why do not she say with prejudice then but back in she do not say that so why do not she say that you have ask for the case the all of them to be dismiss with with prejudice she do not include that language but if i understand their motion do not say now we have satisfy all our pre suit requirement right so she might just have say well you still have not satisfy your pre suit requirement so of course I be not change anything the question be what would have happen if the government come back and say we have satisfy the pre suit requirement would she then have think okay well that be a different story now i do not i do not dismiss these with prejudice now that the government have satisfy the pre suit requirement it can go ahead all the claim that we be then be litigate by the eeoc which do not include the claim that have previously be dismiss for failure to satisfy the pre suit requirement i think that be not it be not right if the prior ruling be base on a curable dismissal and the eeoc have simply do nothing with respect to that set of claim neither cure it nor renounce the possibility that they would cure it in the court be face a much reduce set of claim in a different suit mr smith do you think it be possible to have a pattern of practice appropriate class claim with respect to sexual harassment mr fletcher could i could i take you back to where you start which be whether you have waive all of this and you know you point out that the question present include your argument but clearly it be as you say a different argument from the one you litigate below both in the district court and in the circuit court and in the bio that you file here and mr smith have respond to this new argument in less than a page which be really his every right to do give that it have sort of sprung from your head at this late date and I be wonder why we should not just ignore the whole thing well you can always file a footnote you know i mean well regardless of whether there be blame on either part we be still in a situation where it really have not be brief by one party and it have not be think about by the court below and usually you know we do that we be a court of review not a first view mine and we would kick it back that seem even bad i mean nobody have think about that it seem to be a complicated factual scenario you know there be circumstance in which you could proceed with a class properly and circumstance in which you could not and we know nothing about whether this be the circumstance one or the other ,230.27,Roberts Court,"Mar 28, 2016",CRST Van Expedited Inc.,Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,14-1375,"Dec 4, 2015","May 19, 2016",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2015,Encino Motorcars v. Navarro,114,Elena Kagan,"I guess I don't understand that. I mean, it's kind of the case for Chevron deference and notice-and-comment rulemaking. They clearly considered exactly this question. They made a judgment on it. They have effected that judgment within a notice-and-comments setting. I mean, if that's not Chevron, what is? Of course. Yeah. Because the first one is not so good. The first -- I mean, agencies do this all the time. They say, this is the way we read the statute. This is the way we want to read the statute. And this Court has never been in the business of saying, oh, when you think that the statute says something, you don't get deference. Whereas when you think the statute is ambiguous but you give other reasons, you do get deference. I mean, that would be a -- a completely unadministrable line to use. This is not parroting the statute. This is saying we read this statute in a way which we think is better than another way. So, I mean, the question is on the reliance interests, if you think people have been relying and will be punished for that reliance. And I guess the question to you is, well, why would that be so? Because this rule applies not retroactively but only prospectively, and there is a particular provision in the Portal-to-Portal Act, which essentially says if you relied on an old interpretation, don't worry. You won't be subject to any damages with respect to that interpretation. Well, I suspect, Mr. Clement, you would say to your clients, you know, you are taking a risk because now the agency has changed their minds. And so going forward, don't worry. You're off the hook with respect to everything you've done in the past. But going forward, given this doctrine called Chevron Deference, the agency is going to get a thumb on the scales, and it's very possible that you're going to, you know, be subject to damages if you keep doing what you're doing. If I might: Mr. Clement suggested that you might be seeking damages for pre-2011 conduct. Are you? Mr. Yang, why was it -- I mean, for the most part this explanation seems like not the world's best explanation to me but perfectly adequate. But Mr. Clement does have a point that somehow the agency took out this more specific explanation and I -- I guess if I were just looking at the explanation itself I would say, you know, not an A-plus job, but fine. But it is a little bit perplexing as to why they took this out. Why was that? Wow. I really did not expect expect you to say that. Not an A-plus explanation. (Laughter.)

2015,"Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. v. Manning",114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Hacker, just looking at the language, I mean, I understand your interpretation of it, but it seems to me that there's, you know, a -- just as good interpretation which says the opposite. In other words, you know, what does it mean for a suit to be brought to enforce a liability in a kind of circumstance you're talking about? In the circumstance you're talking about, the suit is brought to enforce State law. Now, it's true that State law might look to Federal law; State law might incorporate Federal law in certain ways; State law might have some kind of relationship to Federal law. But what's the suit brought to enforce? The suit is brought to enforce State law. But State liabilities. But then you're going to be in a situation where the judge is going to have to try to figure out whether State law exactly mimics Federal law, or whether there are minor deviations from Federal law. And that can't be a good jurisdictional test, can it? I don't think this is a marginal question. I think this is kind of a, you know, pretty ordinary question of like, well, what is the State law doing? Is it exactly -- lots of State laws exactly mimic Federal law, and lots of them don't. And you think we can reach that interpretation, even as to the Natural Gas Act consistent with Pan American? Why do you think, Mr. Stris, this different language was used in these ten statutes? Can I ask you to describe your complaint? In other words, Mr. Hacker has a certain characterization or description of your complaint, and the -- and the -- the role played in your complaint by the regulation. So if you had to describe your complaint, and particularly, what role does this regulation play in your claims under State law? Mr. Stris, I guess I don't understand why you're resisting just say saying this language ought to be interpreted in the same way as arising under jurisdiction is interpreted. And it's true they're different words, but it's at least as good an interpretation of these words that they essentially refer to what the arising under test refers to, which after all -- I mean, the arising under test doesn't really have a whole lot to do with the language arising under anymore. So -- so why isn't that just sort of the simplest thing to do is, we have a test, it's a four-part test, and this language seems to fit that test pretty well, and that's what we should do, we should just have one test. ",mr hacker just look at the language i mean i understand your interpretation of it but it seem to me that there be you know a just as good interpretation which say the opposite in other word you know what do it mean for a suit to be bring to enforce a liability in a kind of circumstance you be talk about in the circumstance you be talk about the suit be bring to enforce state law now it be true that state law might look to federal law state law might incorporate federal law in certain way state law might have some kind of relationship to federal law but what be the suit bring to enforce the suit be bring to enforce state law but state liability but then you be go to be in a situation where the judge be go to have to try to figure out whether state law exactly mimic federal law or whether there be minor deviation from federal law and that can not be a good jurisdictional test can it i do not think this be a marginal question i think this be kind of a you know pretty ordinary question of like well what be the state law do be it exactly lot of state law exactly mimic federal law and lot of them do not and you think we can reach that interpretation even as to the natural gas act consistent with pan american why do you think mr stris this different language be use in these ten statute can i ask you to describe your complaint in other word mr hacker have a certain characterization or description of your complaint and the and the the role play in your complaint by the regulation so if you have to describe your complaint and particularly what role do this regulation play in your claim under state law mr stris i guess i do not understand why you be resist just say say this language ought to be interpret in the same way as arise under jurisdiction be interpret and it be true they be different word but it be at least as good an interpretation of these word that they essentially refer to what the arise under test refers to which after all i mean the arise under test do not really have a whole lot to do with the language arise under anymore so so why be not that just sort of the simple thing to do be we have a test it be a four part test and this language seem to fit that test pretty well and that be what we should do we should just have one test ,144.61,Roberts Court,"Dec 1, 2015","Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., et al.","Greg Manning, et al.",14-1132,"Jun 30, 2015","May 16, 2016",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2015,Luis v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"But, Mr. Srebnick, I mean, compare two situations. One is the one that Monsanto talked about where, yeah, a bank robber goes in and he has a pile of money now. And Monsanto says, you know, even though he wants to use that money to pay for an attorney, too bad. Now a bank robber goes in, he has a pile of money, he puts it into a separate bank account, he uses that bank account to pay his rent, to pay other expenses, and he uses the money that would have gone for the rent and other expenses to pay a lawyer. Why should the two cases be treated any differently for Sixth Amendment purposes? Mr. Srebnick, this goes back, I think, to the Chief Justice's first question. It seems that the distinction that you're making is one that the Court explicitly rejected in Monsanto. In other words, the Court said the Sixth Amendment here is the exact same thing as the First Amendment. It even used that example that Justice Scalia gave, or that general example. And -- and so it goes back to the Chief Justice's question in -- in the sense of there's a very powerful intuition behind your argument, but it's a powerful intuition that was explicitly rejected by us. And -- and this case doesn't seem to present any different circumstances than that one. I might just be repeating myself, but -- but I thought that, again, that distinction was the one specifically rejected in Monsanto. I mean, Monsanto could have said Caplin & Drysdale is different because it's postconviction. But Monsanto refused to say that. Monsanto said the same rule that applies postconviction ought to apply upon a finding of probable cause. Mr. Dreeben -- Mr. Dreeben, I think, you know, in essence your argument goes like this: You have Monsanto, you combine Monsanto with a -- a simple factual acknowledgment that money is fungible, and it gets you to a judgment in this case. You win, the petitioner loses. And -- and, you know, that's a fair, strong argument, if -- if one is comfortable with Monsanto. I mean, there is -- so I think I would just ask you, I mean, suppose the Court is just uncomfortable with the path we started down the road on in Monsanto? And you might be right that it just doesn't make sense to draw a line here, but it leaves you with a situation in which more and more and more we're depriving people of the ability to hire counsel of choice in complicated cases. And so what should we do with that intuition that Monsanto sent us down the wrong path? Mr. Dreeben, if I could go back to Justice Alito's questions about your interpretation of the statute, I think what Justice Alito was suggesting was that (a)(2)(A) would be completely subsumed by (a)(2)(B) on your interpretation, and I don't think that you got around to answering that question. No, but in -- in just saying that, you're essentially saying, yes, (B) expands it out, meaning it covers everything that (A) covers and some more. Do you think that there's any -- Do you think that there's any way to read this statute such that it applies to people who wish to retain counsel as opposed to make other expenditures? ",but mr srebnick i mean compare two situation one be the one that monsanto talk about where yeah a bank robber go in and he have a pile of money now and monsanto say you know even though he want to use that money to pay for an attorney too bad now a bank robber go in he have a pile of money he put it into a separate bank account he use that bank account to pay his rent to pay other expense and he use the money that would have go for the rent and other expense to pay a lawyer why should the two case be treat any differently for sixth amendment purpose mr srebnick this go back i think to the chief justice s first question it seem that the distinction that you be make be one that the court explicitly reject in monsanto in other word the court say the sixth amendment here be the exact same thing as the first amendment it even use that example that justice scalia give or that general example and and so it go back to the chief justice s question in in the sense of there be a very powerful intuition behind your argument but it be a powerful intuition that be explicitly reject by us and and this case do not seem to present any different circumstance than that one i might just be repeat myself but but i think that again that distinction be the one specifically reject in monsanto i mean monsanto could have say caplin drysdale be different because it be postconviction but monsanto refuse to say that monsanto say the same rule that apply postconviction ought to apply upon a finding of probable because mr dreeben mr dreeben i think you know in essence your argument go like this you have monsanto you combine monsanto with a a simple factual acknowledgment that money be fungible and it get you to a judgment in this case you win the petitioner lose and and you know that be a fair strong argument if if one be comfortable with monsanto i mean there be so i think i would just ask you i mean suppose the court be just uncomfortable with the path we start down the road on in monsanto and you might be right that it just do not make sense to draw a line here but it leave you with a situation in which more and more and more we be deprive people of the ability to hire counsel of choice in complicated case and so what should we do with that intuition that monsanto send us down the wrong path mr dreeben if i could go back to justice alito s question about your interpretation of the statute i think what justice alito be suggest be that a a would be completely subsume by a b on your interpretation and i do not think that you get around to answer that question no but in in just say that you be essentially say yes b expand it out mean it cover everything that a cover and some more do you think that there be any do you think that there be any way to read this statute such that it apply to people who wish to retain counsel as oppose to make other expenditure ,194.42,Roberts Court,"Nov 10, 2015",Sila Luis,United States,14-419,"Jun 8, 2015","Mar 30, 2016",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2015,Evenwel v. Abbott,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Consovoy, of course it's true that when we apportion House members, we use total population as the metric. And the question that's raised by your position is why it would be the case that the Constitution requires something with respect to one apportionment that it prohibits with respect to another. I'm -- I'm sorry. Did I just understand you to say that you think that the -- the House apportionment rule is not clear? Well, Mr. Consovoy -- Mr. Consovoy, could I go back to the question that Justice Breyer raised and can -- stripped, if he'll permit me, of the Guarantee Clause, because the Fourteenth Amendment is actually quite -- you know, the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment explicitly considered this issue, and, you know, made a decision. So Senator Howard, who introduces the Amendment on behalf of the joint committee that drafts it, talks about these deliberations. And he says the committee adopted numbers as the most just and satisfactory basis, and that's the principle upon which the Constitution itself was originally framed, referring back to the original drafting. And then he says numbers, not voters; numbers, not property; this is the theory of the Constitution. Now, this is the theory of the Constitution as to one thing, which is not the thing that you are talking about. This is the theory of the Constitution as to House apportionment. But again, I'll go back to this question. This is just a clear, explicit choice that was made about what it meant to -- to have equal representation with respect to that area. And how you go from that being mandated to it being prohibited in the State context is something that I still can't quite work myself around. That's a good person to be on the side of. I hear you as to that it does not apply. I mean, I guess I can -- I can understand. I might not agree with, but I can understand the position that says that the requirement might not apply. But you are suggesting that we go beyond that, and to say, not only does the requirement not apply, but that States have to do it the exact opposite way. ",mr consovoy of course it be true that when we apportion house member we use total population as the metric and the question that be raise by your position be why it would be the case that the constitution require something with respect to one apportionment that it prohibit with respect to another I be I be sorry do i just understand you to say that you think that the the house apportionment rule be not clear well mr consovoy mr consovoy could i go back to the question that justice breyer raise and can strip if he will permit me of the guarantee clause because the fourteenth amendment be actually quite you know the framer of the fourteenth amendment explicitly consider this issue and you know make a decision so senator howard who introduce the amendment on behalf of the joint committee that draft it talk about these deliberation and he say the committee adopt number as the most just and satisfactory basis and that be the principle upon which the constitution itself be originally frame refer back to the original drafting and then he say number not voter number not property this be the theory of the constitution now this be the theory of the constitution as to one thing which be not the thing that you be talk about this be the theory of the constitution as to house apportionment but again I will go back to this question this be just a clear explicit choice that be make about what it mean to to have equal representation with respect to that area and how you go from that be mandate to it be prohibit in the state context be something that i still can not quite work myself around that be a good person to be on the side of i hear you as to that it do not apply i mean i guess i can i can understand i might not agree with but i can understand the position that say that the requirement might not apply but you be suggest that we go beyond that and to say not only do the requirement not apply but that state have to do it the exact opposite way ,134.58,Roberts Court,"Dec 8, 2015","Sue Evenwel, et al.","Greg Abbott, Governor of Texas, et al.",14-940,"May 26, 2015","Apr 4, 2016",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2015,Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, I don't understand how that helps you, Mr. Landau. You're saying that the test is what the source of authority is, and you're saying that the source of authority here is the Puerto Rican people. But that seems to be just -- you're not taking another step back. What's the source of authority of the Puerto Rican people? The source of authority of the Puerto Rican people was a congressional act. If you go back, the ultimate source of authority is Congress. Well, but Congress today, if it felt like it -- and of course it won't. But if it felt like it, could Congress go back on that decision? Even in saying that, Mr. Landau, you're putting Congress in the driver's seat here: It was done at the invitation of Congress. Congress approved it. Presumably Congress can unapprove it if Congress ever wished to. So if Congress is in the driver's seat, why isn't Congress the source of authority for the purposes of our Double Jeopardy jurisprudence -- -- which seems to make that the issue? I mean, you can imagine a different Double Jeopardy jurisprudence where the issue was who just exercises authority in the real world? But that seems not to be what we ask. It does seem, Mr. Unikowsky, as if Congress has given Puerto Rico as much authority as it possibly could have short of making it a State itself. Do you disagree with that? Mr. Unikowsky, it sure seems as though in the early 1950s, Congress with respect to Puerto Rico, said we want to give it some sovereign authority. We want to give it an enormous amount of Home Rule authority, basically everything, and we also have some idea in our heads that Puerto Rico ought to be a sovereign with all the things sovereigns have like a Constitution and a ""We the People"" clause. And -- and why isn't that something -- it's -- it's an unusual idea, to be sure, a -- a sovereign territory. But Congress seems to have wanted to do exactly that. Mr. Unikowsky, you -- you said before that Congress didn't mean to confer sovereignty here. Do you think Congress could do that? Do you think it's not possible, Ms. Saharsky -- I mean, putting aside whether Congress has done it here, but you think it's simply not possible for Congress to confer sovereignty in the sense that would matter for the Double Jeopardy Clause? Yes. But -- but -- but not short of that.

So I'm -- I guess I'm -- I guess I'm a little bit unclear as to what you're arguing. I mean, one rule could be did the judge have some significant involvement in a critical trial decision as a lawyer. Is that your rule, or are you adding something to that rule? There's something -- Well, do they have to hear -- Excuse me. There's something unsatisfying about the remedy that you're requesting, right? Because if the idea is that one judge can affect a whole panel, which seems right to me, but presumably that effect doesn't go away the moment that we send it back and they have to deal with it again, so aren't -- don't they continue to be tainted in some way? What is the standard on rehearing? Is -- is -- it must be a very different standard, isn't it? It's -- Mr. Eisenberg -- If I understood your answer to the Chief Justice, you said significant involvement in a critical trial decision would be a critical factor in deciding when a person had crossed the constitutional line. You then simply said that there's kind of a statute of limitations on it, and because this is 30 years ago, that makes a difference. Am I understanding you correctly? I'm not sure I understood the difference there. You mean you have to be in trial in the courtroom as opposed to in the office making critical strategy decisions about how to prosecute a case? Well, just -- I mean, just go back to what the test is. So it's significant involvement in what, at what time? And what time is the critical time? Is it six months? Five years? Ten years? But as I understand you, the one factor that seems to be controlling here is the time limit. And other than that, there's -- everything points to due process demanding a recusal, except for the time limit. He made the most important decision that could be made in this case. I'm sorry. Isn't there a difference between those two things? Do you think he didn't take that decision extremely seriously? Suppose this case were exactly the same, except he had done it three years ago.

2015,Nebraska v. Parker,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Smith, can -- can I take you back to Justice Scalia's question? You know, because usually, at least now, we don't think much of subsequent history of any kind. Now, maybe they thought a little bit more highly of it in the days when Solem was written, but now it would -- it's -- it's pretty much of a stretch to use subsequent legislative history or subsequent history generally when we're dealing with interpreting a statute. I'm just wondering: Is there a reason why it should be more credited here than in any other context? Mr. Smith, I -- I can understand why people might be concerned, for all the reasons that you're talking about. We do have pretty clear and settled law in this area with respect to diminishment, that we've said only Congress can diminish, that the idea is that we're supposed to look to congressional intent. And you say Congress didn't really think in these terms. And there's something that's fair about that. But Congress did use very different language in different ones of these acts, and we've looked to that language as a pretty good guide to suggesting which ones diminish and which ones do not. And it seems as though the language here in -- in the act in which we're concerned -- it's -- it's none of the language that would suggest that Congress diminished this act. So I was wondering if you could talk to that. Is there anything in the language of this statute that suggests a diminishment? Any of the usual kind of we cede everything, we relinquish everything? Like, what's the best you can do on that? Mr. Smith, on the City of Sherrill point, the Chief Justice asked you before do you agree whether this was -- whether this is waived. And you said, well, we cite City of Sherrill on page 25 or something like that. Below, what was the status of the City of Sherrill argument in the lower courts? I'm not sure quite what that means. Does that mean de facto diminishment under Solem, or does that mean -- Solem -- or does that mean that you talked about City of Sherrill as an independent ground? ",mr smith can can i take you back to justice scalia s question you know because usually at least now we do not think much of subsequent history of any kind now maybe they think a little bit more highly of it in the day when solem be write but now it would it be it be pretty much of a stretch to use subsequent legislative history or subsequent history generally when we be deal with interpret a statute I be just wondering be there a reason why it should be more credit here than in any other context mr smith i i can understand why people might be concern for all the reason that you be talk about we do have pretty clear and settled law in this area with respect to diminishment that we have say only congress can diminish that the idea be that we be suppose to look to congressional intent and you say congress do not really think in these term and there be something that be fair about that but congress do use very different language in different one of these act and we have look to that language as a pretty good guide to suggest which one diminish and which one do not and it seem as though the language here in in the act in which we be concerned it be it be none of the language that would suggest that congress diminish this act so i be wonder if you could talk to that be there anything in the language of this statute that suggest a diminishment any of the usual kind of we cede everything we relinquish everything like what be the best you can do on that mr smith on the city of sherrill point the chief justice ask you before do you agree whether this be whether this be waive and you say well we cite city of sherrill on page or something like that below what be the status of the city of sherrill argument in the low court I be not sure quite what that mean do that mean de facto diminishment under solem or do that mean solem or do that mean that you talk about city of sherrill as an independent ground ,133.23000000000002,Roberts Court,"Jan 20, 2016","State of Nebraska, et al.","Mitch Parker, et al.",14-1406,"Oct 1, 2015","Mar 22, 2016",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2015,Kansas v. Carr,114,Elena Kagan,"But what do you think about a case, whether or not this is that case, in which it is quite clear to a judge that each of two defendants is just going to be pointing to the other person and saying, that was the bad actor. He is why these terrible crimes committed. And you know that -- you know, each of them is going to be doing that. Should a judge separate the penalty proceeding in that context? Well, I guess I am asking you in what kind of factual circumstances you would find that standard met? When you said it the first time, you had ""deprived of a fair trial"" and then something about individualized sentencing; is that right? Is that supposed to indicate that this is deriving both from the Due Process Clause and from the Eighth Amendment? Sorry, but I'm not -- I think I missed something you said, but -- forgive me. But the constitutional standard that you're proposing, is that a constitutional standard for both the guilt phase and the sentencing phase? And is it also for both non-capital and capital? Are you drawing no distinctions among those four things? So it seems a little bit counterintuitive to me, the idea that, you know, the guilt phase in a very minor crime would have the exact same standard applicable to it as the guilt phase of a capital crime and then as the sentencing phase of a capital crime. But, Mr. Liu, I mean, given the kind of evidence that was presented in this case, the idea that somebody was a lousy big brother seems pretty small on -- in the -- in the scale of things. Mr. Liu, could you, for me, just tell me what is the specific prejudice you're alleging here? In other words, tell me more than just, oh, he was a corrupting influence. What evidence particularly came in -- -- and why do you think it might have mattered to the jury? Just give me your best shot. Maybe I'm missing something, but if -- if your client's strategy was to make Reginald as bad -- the bad actor in the case, why didn't that evidence actually go hand in hand with your client's strategy, which was to say it's all on Reginald? How -- how was the change to the pattern instructions made? Who made it? Is it approved by the Supreme Court or is it divorced from the Supreme Court? You believe it's correct, that it is approved by the Court. Okay. Sorry. What does that mean, a ""catch-all instruction""? Didn't the Court -- But General, if I can understand your argument, you're saying not only that that analysis would come out the State's way, but you're saying this -- the lower court really never did that analysis at all, right? It didn't think that it was doing that analysis. It didn't think that that analysis was necessary because it thought that there was just a per se rule that one had to give this instruction; is that correct? I find that a little bit confusing. It just -- it sounds like they just sort of cited Boyde but failed to pay attention to anything Boyde said about what the analysis ought to be and instead substituted their own analysis, which was a per se rule deriving from the Eighth Amendment. You're not saying that that's required by the Eighth Amendment; is that right? You're not advocating a per se rule that such instructions are necessary. So could I -- could I talk about the circumstances of this case? Which is, you know, you have an instruction here that is unfortunate in its juxtaposition of the reasonable doubt standard and the reference to mitigating circumstances. And, you know, it is unfortunate, and I can see why they changed their pattern instructions. But -- but we've said that the analysis is a holistic one. We look at everything. You also have this mercy instruction. You have a catch-all instruction. You have, in both cases, arguments by the prosecutors that indicate fairly clearly that this is really all up to the jurors in Gleason. It says, ""Mitigating circumstances are every juror's individual choice."" In -- in Carr, the prosecutor says, ""Anything in fairness may be considered as extenuating."" So I guess the question is, even if this is a really unfortunate wording in the reasonable doubt/mitigating circumstances juxtaposition, why doesn't all of this other stuff indicate that no juror was likely to be confused? ",but what do you think about a case whether or not this be that case in which it be quite clear to a judge that each of two defendant be just go to be point to the other person and say that be the bad actor he be why these terrible crime commit and you know that you know each of them be go to be do that should a judge separate the penalty proceeding in that context well i guess i be ask you in what kind of factual circumstance you would find that standard meet when you say it the first time you have deprive of a fair trial and then something about individualized sentencing be that right be that suppose to indicate that this be derive both from the due process clause and from the eighth amendment sorry but I be not i think i miss something you say but forgive me but the constitutional standard that you be propose be that a constitutional standard for both the guilt phase and the sentence phase and be it also for both non capital and capital be you draw no distinction among those four thing so it seem a little bit counterintuitive to me the idea that you know the guilt phase in a very minor crime would have the exact same standard applicable to it as the guilt phase of a capital crime and then as the sentence phase of a capital crime but mr liu i mean give the kind of evidence that be present in this case the idea that somebody be a lousy big brother seem pretty small on in the in the scale of thing mr liu could you for me just tell me what be the specific prejudice you be allege here in other word tell me more than just oh he be a corrupting influence what evidence particularly come in and why do you think it might have matter to the jury just give me your best shot maybe I be miss something but if if your client s strategy be to make reginald as bad the bad actor in the case why do not that evidence actually go hand in hand with your client s strategy which be to say it be all on reginald how how be the change to the pattern instruction make who make it be it approve by the supreme court or be it divorce from the supreme court you believe it be correct that it be approve by the court okay sorry what do that mean a catch all instruction do not the court but general if i can understand your argument you be say not only that that analysis would come out the state s way but you be say this the low court really never do that analysis at all right it do not think that it be do that analysis it do not think that that analysis be necessary because it think that there be just a per se rule that one have to give this instruction be that correct i find that a little bit confuse it just it sound like they just sort of cited boyde but fail to pay attention to anything boyde say about what the analysis ought to be and instead substitute their own analysis which be a per se rule derive from the eighth amendment you be not say that that be require by the eighth amendment be that right you be not advocate a per se rule that such instruction be necessary so could i could i talk about the circumstance of this case which be you know you have an instruction here that be unfortunate in its juxtaposition of the reasonable doubt standard and the reference to mitigate circumstance and you know it be unfortunate and i can see why they change their pattern instruction but but we have say that the analysis be a holistic one we look at everything you also have this mercy instruction you have a catch all instruction you have in both case argument by the prosecutor that indicate fairly clearly that this be really all up to the juror in gleason it say mitigating circumstance be every juror s individual choice in in carr the prosecutor say anything in fairness may be consider as extenuate so i guess the question be even if this be a really unfortunate wording in the reasonable doubtmitigating circumstance juxtaposition why do not all of this other stuff indicate that no juror be likely to be confuse ,260.54999999999995,Roberts Court,"Oct 7, 2015",Kansas,Jonathan and Reginald Carr,14-449,"Mar 30, 2015","Jan 20, 2016",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2015,Gobeille v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co.,114,Elena Kagan,"Why isn't there also a requirement that the law just not be burdensome over a certain level? Then why hasn't that burden been shown? There's something very intuitive about their argument, and it's -- it's essentially what Justice Kennedy said. It's -- it's when 50 States devise 50 different requirements for this, different formatting, different particular information requested, that just all adds up to a lot of hassle, which all adds up to a lot of money. Mr. Waxman, why was it that you introduced absolutely no evidence of burden in the lower courts here? Well, that sounds like a one-size-fits-all solution, and there's some value to States being able to think about their own health care needs. And to think about what things they want. So I mean, just again, let's go back to this burden because it is a very intuitive idea that you have on your side: 50 different States; that's a lot of money. But I guess I wonder why it is a lot of money. I mean, as I understand what's going on here, that all the data that's being requested is data that Blue Cross Blue Shield generates anyway. That all the data that's being requested is data that Blue Cross Blue Shield reports for other people. That really this is a formatting question, even with respect to the wide variety of States, that the States have started getting their formatting more uniform. So I -- I mean, you know, it's -- you can say it's 93 million people, but, you know, in the end what's the cost? And why don't you have it in the record? Mr. Waxman, I guess I just don't understand this argument. I -- I -- I mean, I -- I understand completely that there should be some restriction on overly burdensome State regulations of whatever kind. You know, it could be taxes, it could be day care, it could be anything. Right? But why is it that this regulation falls in a different category than taxes or childcare or anything else? Because the State here clearly is not attempting to, and is not regulating, payment of benefits. It's doing something that has an effect on your operations, no doubt, but the State is operating in a completely separate area for completely separate purposes in a way that does not trump or conflict with, or anything else, the choices that ERISA has made as to payment of benefits. Mr. Waxman, could a State pass a tax law that requires information about -- about pension disbursements, about claim payments, about assets held in trust? Could a State do that? A tax law that requires information of various kinds. Not impose a tax, that requires information in order to ensure that the State is taxing the right things. Do you think that a State tax law can't require any information about any of the things that ERISA does, that the plans do, pension disbursements, assets, claim payments, nothing? ",why be not there also a requirement that the law just not be burdensome over a certain level then why have not that burden be show there be something very intuitive about their argument and it be it be essentially what justice kennedy say it be it be when state devise different requirement for this different formatting different particular information request that just all add up to a lot of hassle which all add up to a lot of money mr waxman why be it that you introduce absolutely no evidence of burden in the low court here well that sound like a one size fit all solution and there be some value to state be able to think about their own health care need and to think about what thing they want so i mean just again let us go back to this burden because it be a very intuitive idea that you have on your side different state that be a lot of money but i guess i wonder why it be a lot of money i mean as i understand what be go on here that all the data that be be request be data that blue cross blue shield generate anyway that all the data that be be request be data that blue cross blue shield report for other people that really this be a formatting question even with respect to the wide variety of state that the state have start get their formatting more uniform so i i mean you know it be you can say it be million people but you know in the end what be the cost and why do not you have it in the record mr waxman i guess i just do not understand this argument i i i mean i i understand completely that there should be some restriction on overly burdensome state regulation of whatever kind you know it could be tax it could be day care it could be anything right but why be it that this regulation fall in a different category than tax or childcare or anything else because the state here clearly be not attempt to and be not regulate payment of benefit it be do something that have an effect on your operation no doubt but the state be operate in a completely separate area for completely separate purpose in a way that do not trump or conflict with or anything else the choice that erisa have make as to payment of benefit mr waxman could a state pas a tax law that require information about about pension disbursement about claim payment about asset hold in trust could a state do that a tax law that require information of various kind not impose a tax that require information in order to ensure that the state be tax the right thing do you think that a state tax law can not require any information about any of the thing that erisa do that the plan do pension disbursement asset claim payment nothing ,187.88,Roberts Court,"Dec 2, 2015","Alfred Gobeille, Chair of the Vermont Green Mountain Care Board",Liberty Mutual Insurance Company,14-181,"Jun 29, 2015","Mar 1, 2016",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1

But that seems silly -- -- Mr. Lamken, and that's why you've been saying that the number doesn't matter, and it doesn't matter whether it's the day before or the day after suit, and it doesn't matter if Congress has specified the docket number because any of those limitations, you would say, well, Congress could do, you know, pretty much the exact same thing except it would be in two cases, or except it would be without the docket number. And your answers suggest how, you know, a little bit nonsensical those distinctions would be. Why doesn't it make a difference that this is in the area of foreign affairs? I had thought that our cases were pretty clear that the political branches -- especially the executive, so I concede that there's a difference there -- but that the political branches have a great deal of power in this area, even when it comes to very particular controversies. Suppose there's -- suppose Iran were holding a great many American hostages, and Iran said, we'll release these hostages if you stop execution in a suit like this. And suppose Congress thought that that was a good deal and -- and said exactly that. I'm not quite sure I understood that answer, and -- and you're -- you're suggesting that if Congress has a good reason to extinguish these claims, then Congress can do it, but if not, not. No. I said Congress passes a statute that basically -- -- affects this deal. Does that mean, Mr. Olson, if I could, you're conceding that Congress could not say, we have a particular case, Smith v. Jones, Smith ought to win? Congress cannot say that, right? No, just under the straight separation of powers argument, that would be adjudicating if Congress said Smith wins in this case? I was giving you a simple hypothetical. I thought that you already answered this, but maybe not. Congress says, we see this case, Smith versus Jones. Smith wins. That's no good. So if that's right, now Congress takes a look at this case and says, we can't just say Smith wins. And then we just -- we take a look at the case and we say, oh, if you just tweaked the law in this particular way, Smith would win. So we tweak the law in this particular way for this case only. But we don't say Smith wins. We just say we're tweaking the law in this particular case for this case only. Is that all right? But usually when we say that, we're talking about amending the law that has effect beyond the particular pending case. And there we say, yes, absolutely, Congress can amend the law. Congress knew that it would affect these pending cases. No problem because Congress passed something, you know, that was within the scope of its legislative powers to amend law affecting this case and others. When you take out the ""and others,"" that seems to create a different kind of problem, one where Congress is doing our job rather than its own. Mr. Kneedler, do you -- do you agree with what Mr. Olson said, that Congress can't just pick a winner in a particular suit? Congress can't say Smith wins in this case -- Okay. But then -- The question that I gave Mr. Olson -- and I -- I'm searching here for an answer -- is -- is what happens if rather than just picking the winner, Congress amends the law, tweaks the law, modifies the law in such a way -- as to only this case -- in such a way that it's absolutely clear that the effect of that will be to pick a winner? And when you say, dictates the outcome, what do you mean by that phrase? ",what if there we be case mr lamken and congress specify them all well i guess what I be ask i guess what I be ask be what that mean a limited category be the number irrelevant if congress specifies them i mean congress could specify a hundred congress could could congress do it could congress do it the day before a lawsuit be file in other word congress know that a lawsuit be go to be file on a particular subject and just create the rule for that lawsuit but the lawsuit have not actually be commence yet suppose it be not suppose it be like congress amend the law so that asset hold in clearstream citibank account be subject to execution by deborah peterson before deborah peterson bring suit but that seem silly mr lamken and that be why you have be say that the number do not matter and it do not matter whether it be the day before or the day after suit and it do not matter if congress have specify the docket number because any of those limitation you would say well congress could do you know pretty much the exact same thing except it would be in two case or except it would be without the docket number and your answer suggest how you know a little bit nonsensical those distinction would be why do not it make a difference that this be in the area of foreign affair i have think that our case we be pretty clear that the political branch especially the executive so i concede that there be a difference there but that the political branch have a great deal of power in this area even when it come to very particular controversy suppose there be suppose iran we be hold a great many american hostage and iran say we will release these hostage if you stop execution in a suit like this and suppose congress think that that be a good deal and and say exactly that I be not quite sure i understood that answer and and you be you be suggest that if congress have a good reason to extinguish these claim then congress can do it but if not not no i say congress pass a statute that basically affect this deal do that mean mr olson if i could you be concede that congress could not say we have a particular case smith v jones smith ought to win congress can not say that right no just under the straight separation of power argument that would be adjudicate if congress say smith win in this case i be give you a simple hypothetical i think that you already answer this but maybe not congress say we see this case smith versus jones smith win that be no good so if that be right now congress take a look at this case and say we can not just say smith win and then we just we take a look at the case and we say oh if you just tweak the law in this particular way smith would win so we tweak the law in this particular way for this case only but we do not say smith win we just say we be tweak the law in this particular case for this case only be that all right but usually when we say that we be talk about amend the law that have effect beyond the particular pending case and there we say yes absolutely congress can amend the law congress know that it would affect these pending case no problem because congress pass something you know that be within the scope of its legislative power to amend law affect this case and others when you take out the and others that seem to create a different kind of problem one where congress be do our job rather than its own mr kneedler do you do you agree with what mr olson say that congress can not just pick a winner in a particular suit congress can not say smith win in this case okay but then the question that i give mr olson and i I be search here for an answer be be what happen if rather than just pick the winner congress amend the law tweak the law modify the law in such a way as to only this case in such a way that it be absolutely clear that the effect of that will be to pick a winner and when you say dictate the outcome what do you mean by that phrase ,240.49,Roberts Court,"Jan 13, 2016",Bank Markazi,"Deborah Peterson, et al.",14-770,"Oct 1, 2015","Apr 20, 2016",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2015,Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt,114,Elena Kagan,"Ms. Toti, could I -- could I just make sure I understand it, because you said 11 were closed on the day that the admitting-privileges requirement took effect; is that correct? And is it right that in the two-week period that the ASC requirement was in effect, that over a dozen facilities shut their doors, and then when that was stayed, when that was lifted, they reopened again immediately; is that right? It's almost like the perfect controlled experiment as to the effect of the law, isn't it? It's like you put the law into effect, 12 clinics closed. You take the law out of effect, they reopen. Mr. Keller, the -- the statistics that I gleaned from the record were that 900,000 women live further than 150 miles from a provider; 750,000, three-quarters of a million, further than 200 miles. Now, that's as compared to just in 2012, where fewer than 100,000 lived over 150 miles, and only 10,000 lived more than 200 miles away. So we're going from, like, 10,000 to three-quarters of a million living more than 200 miles away. Well, can the legislature say anything, General? I mean, if the legislature says we have a -- a health-related abortion regulation here, we've looked around the country and we think that there are ten great hospitals in the country, you know, Massachusetts General, Brigham and Women's, and we're going to make all our abortion facilities conform to the standards of those hospitals, and that will -- you know, that will increase medical care. Now, it's true we don't make anybody else doing any kind -- other kind of procedure conform to those standards, but we think it will increase health benefits if abortion facilities conform to them. Would that be all right? So every abortion facility has to hit the standards of MGH. That would be all right? I'm sure that there's medical evidence that if every hospital, if every facility was as good as Massachusetts General, they would be better facilities. I'm sure that you could find doctors to say that, because MGH, it's a great hospital. But that would be okay, even though it's not applied to any other kind of facility doing any other kind of procedure, even though we know that liposuction is 30 times more dangerous, yet doesn't have the same kinds of requirements. General, could -- could I ask -- could I go back to a question that -- something that you said earlier? And tell me if I'm misquoting you. You said that as the law is now, under your interpretation of it, Texas is allowed to set much, much higher medical standards, whether it has to do with the personnel or procedures or the facilities themselves, higher medical standards, including much higher medical standards for abortion facilities than for facilities that do any other kind of medical work, even much more risky medical work. And you said that that was your understanding of the law; am I right? And I guess I just want to know why would Texas do that? (Laughter.) No, I know, but -- but the assumption of the question, and I think you haven't challenged this assumption, is that there are many procedures that are much higher risk: Colonoscopies, liposuctions, we could go on and on. And -- and you're saying, that's okay, we get to set much higher standards for abortion. And I just want to know why that is. But, of course, the -- I mean, Texas's own regulations actually have made abortion facilities such that that can never happen, because you have continual inspections, I mean, to your credit. So that was really not a problem in Texas, having a kind of rogue outfit there. Texas has taken actions to prevent that. So, again, I just sort of -- I'm left wondering, given this baseline of regulation that prevents rogue outfits of -- like that, why it is that Texas would make this choice. And you say you're allowed to make this choice, and we can argue about that. I just want to know why Texas would make it. Are you -- are you in -- you're not really contesting that there are greater complications in abortion facilities than there are with a great deal of medical procedures that do -- that are not subject to the same standard of regulation. ",ms toti could i could i just make sure i understand it because you say we be close on the day that the admitting privilege requirement take effect be that correct and be it right that in the two week period that the asc requirement be in effect that over a dozen facility shut their door and then when that be stay when that be lift they reopen again immediately be that right it be almost like the perfect control experiment as to the effect of the law be not it it be like you put the law into effect clinic close you take the law out of effect they reopen mr keller the the statistic that i glean from the record we be that woman live further than mile from a provider three quarter of a million further than mile now that be as compare to just in where few than live over mile and only live more than mile away so we be go from like to three quarter of a million living more than mile away well can the legislature say anything general i mean if the legislature say we have a a health relate abortion regulation here we have look around the country and we think that there be ten great hospital in the country you know massachusetts general brigham and woman s and we be go to make all our abortion facility conform to the standard of those hospital and that will you know that will increase medical care now it be true we do not make anybody else do any kind other kind of procedure conform to those standard but we think it will increase health benefit if abortion facility conform to them would that be all right so every abortion facility have to hit the standard of mgh that would be all right I be sure that there be medical evidence that if every hospital if every facility be as good as massachusetts general they would be good facility I be sure that you could find doctor to say that because mgh it be a great hospital but that would be okay even though it be not apply to any other kind of facility do any other kind of procedure even though we know that liposuction be time more dangerous yet do not have the same kind of requirement general could could i ask could i go back to a question that something that you say early and tell me if I be misquote you you say that as the law be now under your interpretation of it texas be allow to set much much high medical standard whether it have to do with the personnel or procedure or the facility themselves high medical standard include much high medical standard for abortion facility than for facility that do any other kind of medical work even much more risky medical work and you say that that be your understanding of the law be i right and i guess i just want to know why would texas do that laughter no i know but but the assumption of the question and i think you have not challenge this assumption be that there be many procedure that be much high risk colonoscopy liposuction we could go on and on and and you be say that be okay we get to set much high standard for abortion and i just want to know why that be but of course the i mean texas s own regulation actually have make abortion facility such that that can never happen because you have continual inspection i mean to your credit so that be really not a problem in texas have a kind of rogue outfit there texas have take action to prevent that so again i just sort of I be left wondering give this baseline of regulation that prevent rogue outfit of like that why it be that texas would make this choice and you say you be allow to make this choice and we can argue about that i just want to know why texas would make it be you be you in you be not really contest that there be great complication in abortion facility than there be with a great deal of medical procedure that do that be not subject to the same standard of regulation ,259.63000000000005,Roberts Court,"Mar 2, 2016","Whole Woman’s Health, et al.","John Hellerstedt, Commissioner, Texas Department of State Health Services, et al.",15-274,"Nov 13, 2015","Jun 27, 2016",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2015,Foster v. Chatman,114,Elena Kagan,"But -- but you're saying in that case or in other cases? And if so, which other cases that, in that situation, we, nonetheless, addressed the reasoning of the intermediate court? Is that what you're saying? And Mr. Bright, just to make sure I understand, all the notes in the prosecutor's files were new; is that right? Yes. Okay. And has the Georgia Supreme Court ever -- ever said anything one way or the other as to whether it's discretionary or not? Well, why would we -- But -- but I -- maybe I'm misunderstanding what you're saying. You're saying there is no such uniform determination that they will exercise their discretion in a certain way, that they are insisting upon their discretion being discretionary. Is that correct? (Laughter.) Can I just ask one more quick question about this. You -- you made reference -- this is an issue that's being litigated in the Georgia courts, is that right, in the Eleventh Circuit? This precise issue? Thank you. Well, I'll -- I'll -- am I right that the issue that is being litigated is whether the Supreme Court review, in cases like this, is discretionary or not discretionary? Me too. Can I -- can I go to the merits? Is that -- is that all right? Okay. Unless other people -- Okay. Look. You have a lot of new information here from these files that suggests that what the prosecutors were doing was looking at the African-American prospective jurors as a group, that they had basically said, we don't want any of these people. Here is the one we want if we really have to take one. But that there -- the -- all the evidence suggests a kind of singling out, which is the very antithesis of the Batson rule. So, you know, I mean -- well, isn't this as -- I'm just going to ask you: Isn't this as clear a Batson violation as a court is ever going to see? But -- but Ms. Burton, wouldn't you agree, in a lot of these Batson cases, you'll have purported justifications, which they could support a valid peremptory strike, right? But that the question for a court is, well, but did they support this valid peremptory strike? In other words, what was the prosecutor thinking? Batson is a rule about purposeful discrimination, about intent. And so it doesn't really matter that there might have been a bunch of valid reasons out there, if the -- if it was clear that the prosecutor was thinking about race. You agree with that, right? Yes, if his intent was to strike based on race, it doesn't matter that he could have had a different intent that would have supported a good peremptory strike. And so the question of whether, you know, someone or other might have been properly struck by -- by a prosecutor isn't really the question. The question is on the total amount of evidence before us, including all these prosecutors' notes, what was going on with respect to each of these peremptory strikes. And then you have to deal with not just, oh, it could have been this or it could have been that, but you have to deal with all this information that what it really was, was they wanted to get the black people off the jury. And Justice Scalia raises, of -- of course, a good point in the mine run of cases, but not in a case where all the evidence of intentional discrimination was not before the judge at the time. Yes, I mean, I think that that's exactly how the decision is framed, right? Because the decision talks about claims that are not reviewable due to res judicata. It lists many, many, many claims, and then it lists a whole bunch of claims that are procedurally defaulted. And then this is in a separate section, the Batson issue, and it's in a section that's with -- with all the other claims that there are merits determinations being made about. And the court is very clear, first sentence, last sentence. First sentence: ""The court finds the prosecution did not violate Batson versus Kentucky."" Last sentence: ""On the merits the person, the"" -- ""the"" -- ""the Petitioner loses."" So -- -- it is -- No. But that -- Sorry. ",but but you be say in that case or in other case and if so which other case that in that situation we nonetheless address the reasoning of the intermediate court be that what you be say and mr bright just to make sure i understand all the note in the prosecutor s file we be new be that right yes okay and have the georgia supreme court ever ever say anything one way or the other as to whether it be discretionary or not well why would we but but i maybe I be misunderstand what you be say you be say there be no such uniform determination that they will exercise their discretion in a certain way that they be insist upon their discretion be discretionary be that correct laughter can i just ask one more quick question about this you you make reference this be an issue that be be litigate in the georgia court be that right in the eleventh circuit this precise issue thank you well I will I will be i right that the issue that be be litigate be whether the supreme court review in case like this be discretionary or not discretionary me too can i can i go to the merit be that be that all right okay unless other people okay look you have a lot of new information here from these file that suggest that what the prosecutor we be do be look at the african american prospective juror as a group that they have basically say we do not want any of these people here be the one we want if we really have to take one but that there the all the evidence suggest a kind of single out which be the very antithesis of the batson rule so you know i mean well be not this as I be just go to ask you be not this as clear a batson violation as a court be ever go to see but but ms burton would not you agree in a lot of these batson case you will have purport justification which they could support a valid peremptory strike right but that the question for a court be well but do they support this valid peremptory strike in other word what be the prosecutor thinking batson be a rule about purposeful discrimination about intent and so it do not really matter that there might have be a bunch of valid reason out there if the if it be clear that the prosecutor be think about race you agree with that right yes if his intent be to strike base on race it do not matter that he could have have a different intent that would have support a good peremptory strike and so the question of whether you know someone or other might have be properly strike by by a prosecutor be not really the question the question be on the total amount of evidence before us include all these prosecutor note what be go on with respect to each of these peremptory strike and then you have to deal with not just oh it could have be this or it could have be that but you have to deal with all this information that what it really be be they want to get the black people off the jury and justice scalia raise of of course a good point in the mine run of case but not in a case where all the evidence of intentional discrimination be not before the judge at the time yes i mean i think that that be exactly how the decision be frame right because the decision talk about claim that be not reviewable due to re judicata it list many many many claim and then it list a whole bunch of claim that be procedurally default and then this be in a separate section the batson issue and it be in a section that be with with all the other claim that there be merit determination be make about and the court be very clear first sentence last sentence first sentence the court find the prosecution do not violate batson versus kentucky last sentence on the merit the person the the the petitioner lose so it be no but that sorry ,245.1,Roberts Court,"Nov 2, 2015",Timothy Tyrone Foster,"Bruce Chatman, Warden",14-8349,"May 26, 2015","May 23, 2016",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

2015,Sheriff v. Gillie,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, why wouldn't Congress have expressed that more clearly? I mean, that's a big thing that you're saying, that the State debt collectors really ought to be treated very differently, the outside debt collectors from the private. And, on the face of the statute, the private and the State really are treated in exactly the same way. There are two provisions. They read identically to each other. And surely there were very clear ways of taking out the State outside debt collectors. You could have just said State debts aren't debts for purposes of this statute or State outside debt collectors aren't debt collectors for purposes of this statute, and yet Congress did none of those things. Rather, Congress adopted a set of provisions that seem perfectly parallel with respect to State and corporate entities. Well, I understand the argument that you can read the same term two different ways, but Congress did use the exact same terms. Mr. Murphy, can I ask, when -- when you are trying to fill out what it means for somebody to be an officer, are you looking to the Dictionary Act? Are you looking to the common law? Are you looking to our cases? Are you looking to some combination of the three -- -- or how would you prioritize those? Can I -- can I ask you, then, a question about the Dictionary Act? Which says an officer ""includes any person authorized by law to perform the duties of the office."" And my question to you is -- is just which -- what is the office there? The office of special counsel. But we know that office exists. (Laughter.) So -- but -- okay. So -- so what does a statute have to do, then, to -- to authorize the person to perform the duties of the office? I guess the question is whether it needs to more authorize an office. You know? A continuing, permanent thing as opposed to, you know, these officeholders who come and go, and sometimes there are more of them, and sometimes there are fewer of them, and sometimes they deal with X many cases, and sometimes they deal with Y many cases, and it all seems very fluctuating. How do you distinguish Germaine, Mr. Murphy? Because that seems a very similar kind of setup to your own. There is a statute that allows a superior to appoint some people, but those -- those contractors are -- sometimes there are more, sometimes there are fewer. The duties aren't precisely defined, and the court there says that's not an officer notwithstanding the statute. So that's to say that we take these cases, whether it's Germaine or, or your side, Hartwell, and we put them in a different box? That seems -- if I understood you correctly, that seems an odd line to draw. It's the difference between delegating all of your authority and delegating part of your authority? I'm not sure what difference it makes. I mean, it seems to me that a letter like this gives you two kinds of information. One is it says ""You owe some sum of money to the State,"" and that's perfectly true. And the other is that the person signing the letter is acting as an agent of the State, to collect that sum of money. And that seems perfectly true too. So, you know, the letterhead is just a way of saying, ""I'm acting as an agent of the State to collect a sum of money owed to the State. And, yes, if you don't pay this sum of money, the State is not going to feel all that good about you."" So it's all true. Well, you can't really be very serious about that, because in Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical, they were using the name of the attorney general too. One uses name in the text; one uses the name in the letterhead, but both are designed to do the exact same thing, which is to say, ""I'm acting as agent of the Ohio Attorney General in order to collect a sum of money owed to the State."" Well, I think -- I would think that that would be a reason for using the -- the heading, because now the -- the Ohio Attorney General is responsible for all the actions that this debt collector is going to take. And the Ohio Attorney General is going to be more vigilant in policing the actions of that debt collector. You should want that. I don't think that this is a materiality question. I actually do think that this is just a question of is it false or not. Is there anything false about using the attorney general's letterhead when you're an agent of the attorney general? That's the question. Well, they obviously are an agent in all the usual uses of that term. They're acting for the Attorney General in collecting a debt. And the question is, is there anything false about saying, by way of the letterhead, I'm acting for the attorney general? Well, why? If you -- if I use my own letterhead, somebody is likely to throw it out before they get to the text because they've never seen this organization before. You know, the letterhead is a good way of really making the point, I am acting for the attorney general. But they're dealing with somebody who is acting for the attorney general. But if we get to the second question, we've already decided that these people are not officers. They're independent contractors. They might be agents in a casual sense of the word, but they're not officers. Right. So if we assume that they're not officers, then I think Justice Breyer's question holds: What does it mean for that person to issue something as opposed to the Ohio -- May I ask you -- ",well why would not congress have express that more clearly i mean that be a big thing that you be say that the state debt collector really ought to be treat very differently the outside debt collector from the private and on the face of the statute the private and the state really be treat in exactly the same way there be two provision they read identically to each other and surely there we be very clear way of take out the state outside debt collector you could have just say state debt be not debt for purpose of this statute or state outside debt collector be not debt collector for purpose of this statute and yet congress do none of those thing rather congress adopt a set of provision that seem perfectly parallel with respect to state and corporate entity well i understand the argument that you can read the same term two different way but congress do use the exact same term mr murphy can i ask when when you be try to fill out what it mean for somebody to be an officer be you look to the dictionary act be you look to the common law be you look to our case be you look to some combination of the three or how would you prioritize those can i can i ask you then a question about the dictionary act which say an officer include any person authorize by law to perform the duty of the office and my question to you be be just which what be the office there the office of special counsel but we know that office exist laughter so but okay so so what do a statute have to do then to to authorize the person to perform the duty of the office i guess the question be whether it need to more authorize an office you know a continue permanent thing as oppose to you know these officeholder who come and go and sometimes there be more of them and sometimes there be few of them and sometimes they deal with x many case and sometimes they deal with y many case and it all seem very fluctuating how do you distinguish germaine mr murphy because that seem a very similar kind of setup to your own there be a statute that allow a superior to appoint some people but those those contractor be sometimes there be more sometimes there be few the duty be not precisely define and the court there say that be not an officer notwithstanding the statute so that be to say that we take these case whether it be germaine or or your side hartwell and we put them in a different box that seem if i understand you correctly that seem an odd line to draw it be the difference between delegate all of your authority and delegate part of your authority I be not sure what difference it make i mean it seem to me that a letter like this give you two kind of information one be it say you owe some sum of money to the state and that be perfectly true and the other be that the person sign the letter be act as an agent of the state to collect that sum of money and that seem perfectly true too so you know the letterhead be just a way of say I be act as an agent of the state to collect a sum of money owe to the state and yes if you do not pay this sum of money the state be not go to feel all that good about you so it be all true well you can not really be very serious about that because in justice ginsburg s hypothetical they we be use the name of the attorney general too one use name in the text one use the name in the letterhead but both be design to do the exact same thing which be to say I be act as agent of the ohio attorney general in order to collect a sum of money owe to the state well i think i would think that that would be a reason for use the the heading because now the the ohio attorney general be responsible for all the action that this debt collector be go to take and the ohio attorney general be go to be more vigilant in police the action of that debt collector you should want that i do not think that this be a materiality question i actually do think that this be just a question of be it false or not be there anything false about use the attorney general s letterhead when you be an agent of the attorney general that be the question well they obviously be an agent in all the usual us of that term they be act for the attorney general in collect a debt and the question be be there anything false about say by way of the letterhead I be act for the attorney general well why if you if i use my own letterhead somebody be likely to throw it out before they get to the text because they have never see this organization before you know the letterhead be a good way of really make the point i be act for the attorney general but they be deal with somebody who be act for the attorney general but if we get to the second question we have already decide that these people be not officer they be independent contractor they might be agent in a casual sense of the word but they be not officer right so if we assume that they be not officer then i think justice breyer s question hold what do it mean for that person to issue something as oppose to the ohio may i

2015,Bruce v. Samuels,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Shelley, can we go back to the sentence that you're relying on, because I have to admit I don't understand your reading. The -- the sentence says -- and I'm taking out some unnecessary words. It says, the agency shall forward payments to the clerk, singular, until the filing fees are paid. Now, that makes perfect sense if the filing fees are all in one case, going to a single clerk. But if you're right and what they mean is the filing fees are in multiple cases, then it doesn't make sense to say that the agency shall forward payments to the clerk. The only way to make that sentence makes sense, if the filing fees are in multiple cases, is for Congress -- is for the statute to have read, the agency shall forward payments to many clerks or to several clerks seriatim. And that suggests not the per-prisoner approach, but the per-case approach. But then -- so that -- that seems right, to make the sentence work the way you want it to work -- and this is the sentence you are relying on. To make it work the way you want it to work, you have to add language to it. Yes, I'm going to say, you know what, even as I look at that, even if you add that language, it still doesn't make sense. ""The agency shall forward payment to the relevant clerk until multiple filing fees are paid."" It's just -- it doesn't -- the two halves of the sentence don't connect there. Well, but Congress doesn't know that. Congress thinks fees in a case, fees in a case. So then it makes perfect sense. Give the fees in a case to the clerk. But you're saying give fees in multiple cases to the clerk, when it's not. It's give fees to -- in multiple cases to multiple clerks. Ms. Saharsky, can I get back to the $10 rule and the BOP policy with respect to this? I think it was the Chief Justice who said that he didn't really understand. And I share his lack of understanding about how the BOP is actually doing this, given the language of the statute. The statute says, you know, ""shall forward payments each time the amount in the account exceeds $10."" So that suggests to me that if you're looking at an account with $10 and 1 cent, you make the next payment. And I understand from your brief that that's not what the BOP is doing. And how can the BOP be not doing that? But that does raise -- I mean, as Mr. Shelley says, using that exact $50 number. If you have $50 and you have five lawsuits, the $50 is gone, assuming that the BOP's policy is not uniform and maybe is not statutorily authorized. ",mr shelley can we go back to the sentence that you be rely on because i have to admit i do not understand your reading the the sentence say and I be take out some unnecessary word it say the agency shall forward payment to the clerk singular until the filing fee be pay now that make perfect sense if the filing fee be all in one case go to a single clerk but if you be right and what they mean be the filing fee be in multiple case then it do not make sense to say that the agency shall forward payment to the clerk the only way to make that sentence make sense if the filing fee be in multiple case be for congress be for the statute to have read the agency shall forward payment to many clerk or to several clerk seriatim and that suggest not the per prisoner approach but the per case approach but then so that that seem right to make the sentence work the way you want it to work and this be the sentence you be rely on to make it work the way you want it to work you have to add language to it yes I be go to say you know what even as i look at that even if you add that language it still do not make sense the agency shall forward payment to the relevant clerk until multiple filing fee be pay it be just it do not the two half of the sentence do not connect there well but congress do not know that congress think fee in a case fee in a case so then it make perfect sense give the fee in a case to the clerk but you be say give fee in multiple case to the clerk when it be not it be give fee to in multiple case to multiple clerk ms saharsky can i get back to the rule and the bop policy with respect to this i think it be the chief justice who say that he do not really understand and i share his lack of understand about how the bop be actually do this give the language of the statute the statute say you know shall forward payment each time the amount in the account exceed so that suggest to me that if you be look at an account with and cent you make the next payment and i understand from your brief that that be not what the bop be do and how can the bop be not do that but that do raise i mean as mr shelley say use that exact number if you have and you have five lawsuit the be go assume that the bop s policy be not uniform and maybe be not statutorily authorize ,153.81,Roberts Court,"Nov 4, 2015",Antoine Bruce,"Charles E.

2015,Shapiro v. McManus,114,Elena Kagan,"Am I right that Goosby thought of that as part of the jurisdictional question? In other words, it's an application of Bell v. Hood -- -- which suggests that if something is so obviously frivolous, then the Court has no jurisdiction on it at all? Well, why do you -- In reality, on the ground, what percentage of cases is there a request for a three-judge court? Litigants want this? Are there any litigants that say to themselves, I'd rather have a one-judge court, thanks? Can I make sure I understand what you're saying, because what you're saying now is different from what I had thought that your briefs were saying? I had thought in your briefs that you were relying on changes in the law that -- that Congress made in -- I think it's 1976; is that right? But now you're suggesting that you're not relying on that, that you're saying that before that, we -- we viewed as acceptable a -- a one-judge court dismissing a case. Is that now what you're saying, historic practice favors you as opposed to the -- the 1976 amendments favor you? Mr. Sullivan, I -- I -- I guess I'm -- I'm not so inclined to think that. We always have had this very narrow category of cases which we say we're dismissing on jurisdictional grounds that sound kind of merits-y. But -- but we've cabined that. You know, we've basically said that's only when it's completely ridiculous. And so there's no case at all. It's just a laughing stock of a case, given our precedents.

2015,Mathis v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"Isn't there also something that Descamps says that -- that can be done, which is, you know, maybe you have a case and it just gives you the answer. Maybe you have jury instructions and it gives you the answer. If they don't, Descamps indicates in footnote 2 that you can look to the charging documents for the limited purpose of seeing whether the -- the prosecutor is treating the house or a boat as a means or as an element. And sometimes that will be clear. I mean, you might have one set of charging documents, and it will say the person burgled either a house or a boat. And then it will be clear that the -- that the thing is a means, and it's not an element. Or another charging document can say, as to a houseboat, the person burgled a house, and then that indicates that Massachusetts law does treat this as an element and that you have to prove one or the other and that the prosecutor has made his choice. Isn't that right? These documents are a clue to whether something is an element or instead a means. Sometimes they're a very good clue. Sometimes they won't get you all the way there, but they're certainly a clue as to whether something is an element or a means. And so you can look to the Shepard documents to try to figure out that question. Well, I'm not -- -- sure that that's true, Ms. Saharsky. I mean, you could take that Descamps law, and as Mr. Fleming did or some other way, essentially do the exact same thing with an explicit disjunctive. The way Mr. Fleming did it, he said lawfully or unlawfully, you could say breaking and entering or not breaking and entering. I mean, there would be a zillion ways of phrasing the exact same thing disjunctively on the face of a statute. And I think Mr. Fleming is right that that would not have made a difference to our analysis. Assuming that the component is an element. So that gets you back to your first statement, which is that it didn't matter whether it was an element or something else. A means was just as good as long as it's phrased in the disjunctive. And, you know, all of our cases -- it's not just Descamps -- it goes back to Taylor and Shepard and Johnson. They all use the language of elements. Descamps in the introduction uses the word ""elements"" ten times. So if we really meant elements or means or whatever, it's a funny thing -- it's a funny way to write all of our opinions. But you see, Descamps makes it quite clear that there's two different kinds of looking -- what Descamps says is you have to be able to say that a person was necessarily convicted of something. Meaning that the statute requires him to be convicted of something. It is not good enough to look at the course of proceedings and to infer that a jury or a judge actually did find something. Descamps says this in no uncertain terms, that -- you know, I mean, sometimes those inferences can be very powerful. And Descamps says it's not enough. That what you have to find is a necessary finding in the sense that a statute makes something necessary in order for a conviction to occur. And that's the distinction between elements and means. And I'll just say one last thing. And I know I've been talking for a while, so I'll let you talk. But the entire discussion between the dissent and the majority was about this. The -- the dissent said, it's really terrible what the Court just did. It just created this distinction between elements and means. And the majority said, yes, that's exactly the distinction we're using, and we think it's the right decision -- distinction. So nine members of this Court thought that the distinction that we were using was a distinction between elements and means. It's not just footnote 2, if I could just interrupt. I mean, the footnote 2 comes as a substance to the dissent, and the dissent says, this is the problem with the entire opinion, is that it keeps on talking about elements, but it's hard to distinguish between elements and means. And we shouldn't be distinguishing between those two things. So the whole opinion is this elements focus, which then the dissent attacks. If you need to. Well, here, you have a particular statute, a particular State -- excuse me -- a particular State court decision that says exactly what is an element and what is a means and that this is -- this is not an element. So you don't need to look any further than a dispositive State court decision on the subject. Here's what the statute doesn't do. The statute doesn't make it necessary for anybody to convict you of any single one of those things. And one of the points, since 95 percent of cases end in pleas, the statute doesn't make it necessary for you to plead to any one of those things. So whatever information is floating around in these opinions, nobody has had to find -- and the defendant has not had to plead to a particular offense with one of those alternative means. And that's the critical thing under, not just Descamps, under all of these elements-based decisions, is that it doesn't matter what you did. It doesn't even matter that you say you did something. What we have to be able to say is that under the law, you absolutely -- the law required a particular finding that matches the generic crime. And in this case, that finding is not there. I think -- Which is to say that elements don't matter, and that's the thing that is contrary to 25 years of this Court's precedents, because if this Court's precedents say anything, they say that this is an elements-based inquiry, which means that we have to decide whether something is an element. But that sounds -- that sounds very fact-based. You look at the Shepard documents and you see what they actually did. But this Court has said in no uncertain terms that that's not what we do. Much as -- much as some people think that that's an intuitive way to decide these questions, much as some people think that maybe we should have done that 25 years ago, but we don't do that. We don't look at, let's look at the documents and see what the guy did. We say, let's look at the documents and see if he was necessarily convicted of something, meaning that the law required him -- the law required that a particular finding be made in order for this conviction to occur. And that's where your approach is something very different from what we've ever done, because you're saying that, notwithstanding that the law did not require that a particular finding be made, we'll take a look at the documents and decide that that finding was made. But the point of the modified categorical approach is to take a truly divisible statute -- in other words, a statute with three separate elements in it, of which you only need to be convicted of one -- and to figure out whether the one that you were convicted of, the one particular element, matches up with the generic offense. It's not to do anything more than that. Descamps is quite clear on this -- on this matter, that it takes -- it's -- it's three separate elements. Do you -- does what you were convicted of, is that the right element to match the generic offense? Except that you say ""statutory alternatives,"" and I say ""elements,"" because for 25 years we've been saying ""elements,"" and that we can't do this inquiry if we're in the world of nonelemental facts. Elements are what defines the crime. Well, the end of footnote 2 said in some cases you won't need to parse State law because you can figure it out from the Shepard documents, because Shepard documents are a clue to whether something is a means or an element. And so in the situation in which State law is not, as it is in this case, utterly clear on the subject, you won't have to go 1,000 layers down, because the Descamps -- the -- the Shepard documents will tell you, because of the way the prosecutor has charged something, looks like this is just a means, or looks like this is really an element. Well, why wouldn't you look to State law? You have a State law that says exactly that this is not an element. Why wouldn't you just take that? The only -- It -- Please. Here you have a State statute that specifically tells you that this is not an element of the offense. And you were saying why it was that you thought that you could ignore that -- excuse me, not a State statute, but a State judicial opinion -- why it was that you could ignore that. The only reason you could ignore that State judicial opinion is because if you don't care it's an element. And that's very much against what we've been saying since Taylor. ",be not there also something that descamps say that that can be do which be you know maybe you have a case and it just give you the answer maybe you have jury instruction and it give you the answer if they do not descamps indicate in footnote that you can look to the charging document for the limited purpose of see whether the the prosecutor be treat the house or a boat as a mean or as an element and sometimes that will be clear i mean you might have one set of charge document and it will say the person burgle either a house or a boat and then it will be clear that the that the thing be a mean and it be not an element or another charge document can say as to a houseboat the person burgle a house and then that indicate that massachusetts law do treat this as an element and that you have to prove one or the other and that the prosecutor have make his choice be not that right these document be a clue to whether something be an element or instead a mean sometimes they be a very good clue sometimes they will not get you all the way there but they be certainly a clue as to whether something be an element or a mean and so you can look to the shepard document to try to figure out that question well I be not sure that that be true ms saharsky i mean you could take that descamps law and as mr fleming do or some other way essentially do the exact same thing with an explicit disjunctive the way mr fleming do it he say lawfully or unlawfully you could say break and enter or not break and enter i mean there would be a zillion way of phrase the exact same thing disjunctively on the face of a statute and i think mr fleming be right that that would not have make a difference to our analysis assume that the component be an element so that get you back to your first statement which be that it do not matter whether it be an element or something else a mean be just as good as long as it be phrase in the disjunctive and you know all of our case it be not just descamps it go

create this distinction between element and mean and the majority say yes that be exactly the distinction we be use and we think it be the right decision distinction so nine member of this court think that the distinction that we we be use be a distinction between element and mean it be not just footnote if i could just interrupt i mean the footnote come as a substance to the dissent and the dissent say this be the problem with the entire opinion be that it keep on talk about element but it be hard to distinguish between element and mean and we should not be distinguish between those two thing so the whole opinion be this element focus which then the dissent attack if you need to well here you have a particular statute a particular state excuse me a particular state court decision that say exactly what be an element and what be a mean and that this be this be not an element so you do not need to look any further than a dispositive state court decision on the subject here s what the statute do not do the statute do not make it necessary for anybody to convict you of any single one of those thing and one of the point since percent of case end in plea the statute do not make it necessary for you to plead to any one of those thing so whatever information be float around in these opinion nobody have have to find and the defendant have not have to plead to a particular offense with one of those alternative mean and that be the critical thing under not just descamps under all of these element base decision be that it do not matter what you do it do not even matter that you say you do something what we have to be able to say be that under the law you absolutely the law require a particular finding that match the generic crime and in this case that find be not there i think which be to say that element do not matter and that be the thing that be contrary to year of this court s precedent because if this court s precedent say anything they say that this be an element base inquiry which mean that we have to decide whether something be an element but that sound that sound very fact base you look at the shepard document and you see what they actually do but

for year we have be say element and that we can not do this inquiry if we be in the world of nonelemental fact element be what define the crime well the end of footnote say in some case you will not need to parse state law because you can figure it out from the shepard document because shepard document be a clue to whether something be a mean or an element and so in the situation in which state

could ignore that excuse me not a state statute but a state judicial opinion why it be that you could ignore that the only reason you could ignore that state judicial opinion be because if you do not

2015,"Universal Health Services, Inc. v. Escobar",114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Englert, I guess I don't understand that. I mean, let me take Justice Breyer's hypothetical and make it even simpler. Let's say that there's a contract and there is an explicit term, and it says I commit to providing a doctor's care. Yes? And then it turns out that the medical care that was provided was not by a doctor. It was by a nurse or it was by somebody with not even that set of qualifications. And -- and then the person who enters into the contract makes a statement, demands payment, and says the care was provided. Now, some care was provided; it is true. But medical care, a doctor's care was not provided. Now, by withholding that fact and by just saying the care was provided, have I not committed fraud under the common law? So I understood -- So what I understood you to be saying, Mr. Englert, was that all of these common examples, examples that really led to the False Claims Act, are not fraud. So -- Well, let me just give you a few of them. Justice Sotomayor said the government contracts to buy guns; the guns don't shoot. The government contracts to buy boots -- this was all within the context of the Civil War -- the boots fell apart after 12 hours. The government contracts to buy food; the food was rancid. And each of those contractors would come in and would demand payment. And the entire idea behind this statute is that in that demand of payment is a representation. The representation is that I've given you guns that shoot and boots that wear and food that can be eaten. And when -- when that is not true, that is a fraudulent claim. And you're suggesting that all these hypotheticals -- that somehow that's not a fraudulent claim. And I guess that leaves me sort of wondering what do you think would be a fraudulent claim? Well, if those are fraudulent claims -- -- I -- I would think that this is the exact same, is that the contract was for a doctor's medical care, and a doctor's medical care was not provided. A nondoctor's care was provided. If I understand what you're saying, you're saying that in representing that you have satisfied the terms of the contract, you are -- or -- or -- let me say that -- I'll start it over. In demanding payment for having satisfied the contract, you are not representing that you are -- that you have satisfied the contract; that's your point? In demanding payment for satisfaction of the contract, you are not making a representation that you have satisfied the contract? I'm not into every jot and tittle. I'm into material portions of the contract. That -- you know, that the guns shoot, that the boots can be worn, that the food can be eaten -- -- and a doctor's care is a doctor's care. If -- What are examples of -- Mr. Stewart -- I'm sorry. Could you just -- what are immaterial terms for the government? I mean, give me some examples. What would count as not material? When you started and you said that there are two ways in which this could be argued, do you have a preference as to which one of those two ways makes most sense, or are there cases where they diverge, and we should be aware of that? ",mr englert i guess i do not understand that i mean let me take justice breyer s hypothetical and make it even simpler let us say that there be a contract and there be an explicit term and it say i commit to provide a doctor s care yes and then it turn out that the medical care that be provide be not by a doctor it be by a nurse or it be by somebody with not even that set of qualification and and then the person who enter into the contract make a statement demand payment and say the care be provide now some care be provide it be true but medical care a doctor s care be not provide now by withhold that fact and by just say the care be provide have i not commit fraud under the common law so i understood so what i understand you to be say mr englert be that all of these common example example that really lead to the false claim act be not fraud so well let me just give you a few of them justice sotomayor say the government contract to buy gun the gun do not shoot the government contract to buy boot this be all within the context of the civil war the boot fell apart after hour the government contract to buy food the food be rancid and each of those contractor would come in and would demand payment and the entire idea behind this statute be that in that demand of payment be a representation the representation be that I have give you gun that shoot and boot that wear and food that can be eat and when when that be not true that be a fraudulent claim and you be suggest that all these hypothetical that somehow that be not a fraudulent claim and i guess that leave me sort of wonder what do you think would be a fraudulent claim well if those be fraudulent claim i i would think that this be the exact same be that the contract be for a doctor s medical care and a doctor s medical care be not provide a nondoctor s care be provide if i understand what you be say you be say that in represent that you have satisfy the term of the contract you be or or let me say that I will start it over in demand payment for have satisfy the contract you be not represent that you be that you have satisfy the contract that be your point in demand payment for satisfaction of the contract you be not make a representation that you have satisfy the contract I be not into every jot and tittle I be into material portion of the contract that you know that the gun shoot that the boot can be wear that the food can be eat and a doctor s care be a doctor s care if what be example of mr stewart I be sorry could you just what be immaterial term for the government i mean give me some example what would count as not material when you start and you say that there be two way in which this could be argue do you have a preference as to which one of those two way make most sense or be there case where they diverge and we should be aware of that ,203.67,Roberts Court,"Apr 19, 2016","Universal Health Services, Inc.","United States and Massachusetts, ex rel.

2015,Voisine v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"Can I -- Ms. Villa, can I understand what you said? You said you're relying primarily, then, not on the common-law history but on the -- the -- just the language, ""use... of physical force"" and what that means, the ordinary meaning of those words, is that correct? But why isn't -- any of these examples that people give about the reckless behavior? Why -- why couldn't that be a use of force? I mean, Justice Sotomayor said throwing a plate against a wall. You say, well, I have a better example. It's driving a car really fast in a way that will endanger all the inhabitants. But, of course, we've said a number of times -- I mean, we said it most recently in the Sykes case that a car is -- is an instrument of force when used recklessly in that way. So why aren't all of these kinds of examples consistent with the ordinary meaning of use of force? Of course, you're -- you're adding language to the statute now because you said against another person, and that is indeed the language in Leocal. But in Leocal, we said we're not going to decide the question here, which is just the phrase ""use of physical force,"" not against another person, just the phrase, ""use... of physical force."" And tell me -- I mean, I guess your car example doesn't move me very much, so see if you can give me an example which would be reckless behavior under a battery statute but which you think would not involve the use of force. You just said it. He closed the door very forcefully behind him. That's the -- that's the use of physical force. I know. And that's why it's reckless and not knowing or whatever the other term is. But -- but you're still using physical force. And that's the -- that's the term that has to be interpreted here, is the ""use... of physical force."" Well, quite right. But the language -- I feel like I'm repeating myself a little, so I'll just try it one more time. The language is just the use of force. And what we are trying to decide is whether that includes use of force that indeed is carried out without an intent to harm, but is carried out with an understanding that there is a risk of harm. That's what recklessness is. And -- and, you know, doing something like driving a car 200 miles an hour, or throwing a plate, or slamming a door when somebody's hand is in the vicinity, all of those things involve the requisite risk and all of those things involve the use of physical force. But we wouldn't think that the common law has some great definition of the word ""use,"" would we? Yeah. I mean, I hear you today as basically making an ordinary meaning argument, which I think is a good thing because all the briefing on both sides of this has been talking about the common law until it's coming out of your ears, and it's not clear to me why the common law makes any difference at all here. I mean, you know, Congress was operating against a backdrop. It was not the backdrop of the common law; it was the backdrop of 50 States having battery statutes. There's no word in this statute which is a defined -- you know, which is a -- a settled common-law term. So the question is, what was Congress doing? Congress, we said in Castleman, wanted to basically capture the set of battery statutes in which -- which were used for people engaged in domestic violence. Almost all of those statutes use ""recklessness"" within them. Why isn't that the proper place to look rather than the common law? ",can i ms villa can i understand what you say you say you be rely primarily then not on the common law history but on the the just the language use of physical force and what that mean the ordinary meaning of those word be that correct but why be not any of these example that people give about the reckless behavior why why could not that be a use of force i mean justice sotomayor say throw a plate against a wall you say well i have a good example it be drive a car really fast in a way that will endanger all the inhabitant but of course we have say a number of time i mean we say it most recently in the sykes case that a car be be an instrument of force when use recklessly in that way so why be not all of these kind of example consistent with the ordinary meaning of use of force of course you be you be add language to the statute now because you say against another person and that be indeed the language in leocal but in leocal we say we be not go to decide the question here which be just the phrase use of physical force not against another person just the phrase use of physical force and tell me i mean i guess your car example do not move me very much so see if you can give me an example which would be reckless behavior under a battery statute but which you think would not involve the use of force you just say it he close the door very forcefully behind him that be the that be the use of physical force i know and that be why it be reckless and not know or whatever the other term be but but you be still use physical force and that have the that be the term that have to be interpret here be the use of physical force well quite right but the language i feel like I be repeat myself a little so I will just try it one more time the language be just the use of force and what we be try to decide be whether that include use of force that indeed be carry out without an intent to harm but be carry out with an understanding that there be a risk of harm that be what recklessness be and and you know do something like drive a car mile an hour or throw a plate or slam a door when somebody s hand be in the vicinity all of those thing involve the requisite risk and all of those thing involve the use of physical force but we would not think that the common law have some great definition of the word use would we yeah i mean i hear you today as basically make an ordinary meaning argument which i think be a good thing because all the briefing on both side of this have be talk about the common law until it be come out of your ear and it be not clear to me why the common law make any difference at all here i mean you know congress be operate against a backdrop it be not the backdrop of the common law it be the backdrop of state have battery statute there be no word in this statute which be a defined you know which be a a settled common law term so the question be what be congress do congress we say in castleman want to basically capture the set of battery statute in which which we be use for people engage in domestic violence almost all of those statute use recklessness within them why be not that the proper place to look rather than the common law ,222.39,Roberts Court,"Feb 29, 2016","Stephen Voisine, et al.",United States,14-10154,"Oct 30, 2015","Jun 27, 2016",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1

2015,RJR Nabisco v. The European Community,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Katsas, can I ask a question that -- this is an analytical question, not necessarily at all an argument that your result is wrong, but I -- I guess I'm confused by what you said now and what you say in the briefs that this is a matter of looking to the focus of the statute, because my understanding of Morrison is that this whole focus inquiry came in at the second step of the analysis. In other words, once the Court had decided that the presumption against extraterritoriality had not been rebutted, then there was an additional argument that had been made like, oh, this really does involve domestic conduct. And so the Court used this focus test to decide whether it was the domestic conduct or the extraterritorial conduct that was the focus of the statute. But that doesn't seem to answer the question whether the presumption is rebutted at all, and it doesn't seem to answer the question that I think you're trying to get at, and it's an important question, as to whether we look at that presumption question section by section or for the statute as a whole. I -- I guess I just would have thought that the question is whether these are discrete provisions in some way such that a conclusion is to the extraterritoriality of one doesn't really effect -- doesn't tell you anything about the extraterritoriality of the other. And it seems much less important as to what the focus of the statute as a whole is even if, you know, one could -- if one could answer that question. Well, that may have been true, or largely true at the beginning, but how about all these amendments that happened after 9/11 which clearly seemed focus on foreign conduct, foreign organization, foreign harm? Well, possibly they have some domestic application. But if you ask, but why did Congress pass this amendment at this particular moment in time, what was -- I mean, recognizing that it's sometimes hard to figure out what was in people's heads, I mean, don't you think that what was in Congress's heads at that moment in time was foreign terrorist organizations committing terrorist conduct on foreign soil? Well, this just means -- -- foreign organizations, even as to that. That at least suggests foreign organizations. Well, the -- I mean, the whole point of RICO is that it does both. It says ""a pattern of conduct,"" and it links that pattern of conduct to the enterprise. And it seems to be, you know, a little bit of a fool's errand to decide which the focus is, when -- when RICO is clearly something that melds the two and says there is a pattern of conduct and it relates in various kinds of ways to an enterprise. Well, the fact that some things can be separated doesn't mean that everything can be separated. And the question is, how is it possible to understand RICO except as something in which these things are intermelded, and at the very least that -- one is not prior to the other or more important than the other. I mean, if we are going by our cases, we've said about a hundred times that it's the predicate acts that are -- that are the foundation of RICO. Ms. -- please. Sorry. Well, then, can I interrupt and talk about your comity concerns, because I understand them. I mean, they seem very important. But once you say that the presumption against extraterritorial is rebutted, on both the pattern of racketeering and the enterprise, once you say that, then drawing the line where you draw it seems to be very policyish. There doesn't seem to be a whole lot of law behind it. So I want to give you an opportunity to make it as law-like as you can, drawing the line here. Well, Mr. -- Mr. Frederick, I understand that argument with respect to what's the ordinary remedial provision of a statute. But this is something a little bit more than that, right? Because this statute also -- this provision also includes substantive elements that don't apply except in the civil suit for damages. Isn't that right? So why doesn't that make the difference? ",mr katsas can i ask a question that this be an analytical question not necessarily at all an argument that your result be wrong but i i guess I be confuse by what you say now and what you say in the brief that this be a matter of look to the focus of the statute because my understanding of morrison be that this whole focus inquiry come in at the second step of the analysis in other word once the court have decide that the presumption against extraterritoriality have not be rebut then there be an additional argument that have be make like oh this really do involve domestic conduct and so the court use this focus test to decide whether it be the domestic conduct or the extraterritorial conduct that be the focus of the statute but that do not seem to answer the question whether the presumption be rebut at all and it do not seem to answer the question that i think you be try to get at and it be an important question as to whether we look at that presumption question section by section or for the statute as a whole i i guess i just would have think that the question be whether these be discrete provision in some way such that a conclusion be to the extraterritoriality of one do not really effect do not tell you anything about the extraterritoriality of the other and it seem much less important as to what the focus of the statute as a whole be even if you know one could if one could answer that question well that may have be true or largely true at the beginning but how about all these amendment that happen after which clearly seem focus on foreign conduct foreign organization foreign harm well possibly they have some domestic application but if you ask but why do congress pas this amendment at this particular moment in time what be i mean recognize that it be sometimes hard to figure out what be in people s head i mean do not you think that what be in congress s head at that moment in time be foreign terrorist organization commit terrorist conduct on foreign soil well this just mean foreign organization even as to that that at least suggests foreign organization well the i mean the whole point of rico be that it do both it say a pattern of conduct and it link that pattern of conduct to the enterprise and it seem to be you know a little bit of a fool s errand to decide which the focus be when when rico be clearly something that meld the two and say there be a pattern of conduct and it relate in various kind of way to an enterprise well the fact that some thing can be separate do not mean that everything can be separate and the question be how be it possible to understand rico except as something in which these thing be intermelded and at the very least that one be not prior to the other or more important than the other i mean if we be go by our case we have say about a hundred time that it be the predicate act that be that be the foundation of rico ms please sorry well then can i interrupt and talk about your comity concern because i understand them i mean they seem very important but once you say that the presumption against extraterritorial be rebut on both the pattern of racketeering and the enterprise once you say that then draw the line where you draw it seem to be very policyish there do not seem to be a whole lot of law behind it so i want to give you an opportunity to make it as law like as you can draw the line here well mr mr frederick i understand that argument with respect to what be the ordinary remedial provision of a statute but this be something a little bit more than that right because this statute also this provision also include substantive element that do not apply except in the civil suit for damage be not that right so why do not that make the difference ,246.13,Roberts Court,"Mar 21, 2016","RJR Nabisco, Inc., et al.","The European Community, et al.",15-138,"Oct 1, 2015","Jun 20, 2016",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

You've been talking a lot about contamination and outside influence.

And I wonder whether that is a difference that makes a difference in this context. I guess in answer to my question, I was not looking so much for a historical answer. You both have your historical arguments. But for an answer about why we should take this very seriously and think that it makes the postdischarge context different from the precharge -- predischarge context where the -- the inquiry that we do in the predischarge context about have you talked to anybody, have you read a newspaper, just really doesn't get to the heart of the matter in the postdischarge context, which is that you've just taken off your juror clothes and maybe started thinking about what you did when they were on in an entirely different way.

2015,Sturgeon v. Frost,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. -- Mr. Findley, can I ask two quick clarifying questions just so I understand what's at issue here? Your argument applies to the navigable rivers generally; is that right? In other words, to the navigable rivers running through the federally owned land as well as to those running through the inholdings? And is there any information in the record about whether your client actually was running his boat on the portions which were -- are within the federally owned parts, or instead it's the inholdings? Is that what you called them? Yes. Was Federal -- Was Federal public land? Okay. Thank you. Well, Mr. Findley, I mean -- -- whether or not that's true, agencies can change their mind about things. And I think that the question that Justice Breyer is putting to you is this question about what this provision means: ""Shall be subject to the regulations applicable solely to public lands."" I mean, ""solely"" is a very purposive word, you know? I mean, Congress drops lots of words, but you put ""solely"" in a sentence when you mean ""solely."" And this does not apply solely to public lands. Maybe -- I guess maybe -- maybe you can explain that to me. But it seems to me that if you took it out of the statute, what you would have was to something that says no private lands shall be subject to the regulations applicable to public lands. And that's what you should want. If -- if it had said that, no private lands shall be subject to the regulations applicable to public lands, you wouldn't be here. You would have won your case already. But it doesn't say that. It says, ""No private lands shall be subject to the regulations applicable solely"" -- exclusively, only -- ""to public lands."" So you're saying that the word ""solely"" distinguishes between statutes like the Clean Air Act and park land statutes? Because I understand why Congress might have wanted to distinguish between, like, the Clean Air Act and park statutes. But putting the word ""solely"" in, I got to say, does not do that for me. Well, tell me the imperfect way. Well, no. How does that do that? No, seriously. How does that distinguish between two different kinds of generally-applicable statutes, one generally applicable in applying to park lands and not park lands, and another generally applicable in the sense of applying to both public and private lands within parks. If I understand what you're saying, you're saying with respect to a river that's smack in the middle of federally owned lands, okay, a river that's in the middle of federally owned lands, what cannot happen is that the EPA can't come in and say there's some terrible pollution in this river, and we need to address it. That would be off limits? The Coast Guard can do it. The EPA can do. It's only the Park Service that can't do it? And I guess part of my question about this is, I look at that map, you know, and that map of this area has all this green land, which green represents real Federal park land, and there's a river that runs through it. And -- and you're saying that that river that runs through the park land, and nobody can do anything on -- or the Feds can't do anything on? I mean, this isn't the inholdings. I mean, I can understand the argument with respect to the inholdings and the rivers that are running through the inholdings. But this is the rivers that are running through the park land. Now, it seems to me a very strange thing that Congress would have created Federal lands in a Federal park land but said that the Federal Park Service can't have anything to do with the rivers. The rivers are like an important part of the park, aren't they? And if I'm looking at the right section, I mean, I would have thought that that was key to your argument, because it says in these management plans what you need is a -- is a ""description of privately owned areas which are within such unit."" So it's clearly contemplating that there are these private areas that are within the unit. And then as you say, it goes on and says we want in these plans some idea of what regulations are going to be applying on those private lands within the unit.

2015,Lockhart v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Zas, is it possible when you read these three terms, as you say, Congress might have meant to be just trying to pick up every conceivable State statute it could think of. But it's possible also to think of these as the aggravated sexual abuse is the worst offense; the sexual abuse is the medium offense; and the abusive sexual conduct is actually somewhat a more minor offense, in other words, might include things that are not sexual abuse themselves. Let's say indecent exposure or something like that. And if you understand the provisions in that way as sort of going from the top to the bottom and meant to pick up everything, then it would seem that the involving a minor or ward really ought to refer to all of them. Right? That there's no reason why the involving a minor or ward would -- would refer only to the most minor offenses as the others. Maybe I said that wrong. I think I said the exact opposite of what I meant. (Laughter.) What? If you read -- if you read them going -- going down, right -- well, what do you think would follow? (Laughter.) What do you think would follow from that understanding of this list? But just presume with me that abusive sexual conduct is supposed to be -- is supposed to include some things that sexual abuse would not. What do you think follows from that? But why would they be focused on Federal sexual abuse involving adults but not State sexual abuse involving adults? No, but the -- the Federal predicate, the Section 109, I believe it is, does apply to adults as well. So why would they be focused on adults with respect to Federal offenses but not with respect to State offenses? Ms. O'Connell -- Well, could I ask about your -- your basic theory as to that, which, if I understand it, says the reason why we shouldn't worry about redundancy you create is because Congress just wanted to make absolutely clear that the sexual abuse was also sexual abuse involving somebody who couldn't consent. That's basically your theory. And there is a very easy way to do that, and it would have completely made this -- I mean, made this a hundred percent clear. Congress would just have said aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or sexual abuse involving a minor or ward. And just by using the exact same language, it would have been clear, but the distinction was between sexual abuse and sexual abuse involving a minor or ward. But Congress doesn't do that, right? Congress changes the language of the third noun. And that's what creates the puzzlement. And -- and so it seems to me that your theory doesn't really cohere with the fact that this third term -- although, nobody can say exactly what it means that is different -- the third term is linguistically dissimilar from the second one. You're not suggesting this is just a scrivener's error, are you? That it was meant to be contact? Well, can I go back to the -- to the language? You know, it's confusing language. And I showed it to all my clerks and -- and basically said how would you read it. And two came out on one side, and two came out on the other side. But -- but I'm sort of left with this feeling that it -- we're not in -- in a situation where there are dueling canons. We actually might be in a situation where one canon trumps the other. I mean, you have this last-antecedent rule, and it's an important rule. But it gives way when a certain -- when there is a certain quality to all the antecedents when they're all parallel and when the last modifier equally sensibly refers to them all, right? And that that's a situation, so that series-qualifier rule is in some sense a rule about when the last-antecedent rule doesn't apply. So I guess I would ask you to comment on that. ",mr zas be it possible when you read these three term as you say congress might have mean to be just try to pick up every conceivable state statute it could think of but it be possible also to think of these as the aggravated sexual abuse be the bad offense the sexual abuse be the medium offense and the abusive sexual conduct be actually somewhat a more minor offense in other word might include thing that be not sexual abuse themselves let us say indecent exposure or something like that and if you understand the provision in that way as sort of go from the top to the bottom and meant to pick up everything then it would seem that the involve a minor or ward really ought to refer to all of them right that there be no reason why the involve a minor or ward would would refer only to the most minor offense as the others maybe i say that wrong i think i say the exact opposite of what i mean laughter what if you read if you read them go go down right well what do you think would follow laughter what do you think would follow from that understanding of this list but just presume with me that abusive sexual conduct be suppose to be be suppose to include some thing that sexual abuse would not what do you think follow from that but why would they be focus on federal sexual abuse involve adult but not state sexual abuse involve adult no but the the federal predicate the section i believe it be do apply to adult as well so why would they be focus on adult with respect to federal offense but not with respect to state offense ms oconnell well could i ask about your your basic theory as to that which if i understand it say the reason why we should not worry about redundancy you create be because congress just want to make absolutely clear that the sexual abuse be also sexual abuse involve somebody who could not consent that be basically your theory and there be a very easy way to do that and it would have completely make this i mean make this a hundred percent clear congress would just have say aggravate sexual abuse sexual abuse or sexual abuse involve a minor or ward and just by use the exact same language it would have be clear but the distinction be between sexual abuse and sexual abuse involve a minor or ward but congress do not do that right congress change the language of the third noun and that be what create the puzzlement and and so it seem to me that your theory do not really cohere with the fact that this third term although nobody can say exactly what it mean that be different the third term be linguistically dissimilar from the second one you be not suggest this be just a scrivener s error be you that it be mean to be contact well can i go back to the to the language you know it be confusing language and i show it to all my clerk and and basically say how would you read it and two come out on one side and two come out on the other side but but I be sort of left with this feeling that it we be not in in a situation where there be duel canon we actually might be in a situation where one canon trump the other i mean you have this last antecedent rule and it be an important rule but it give way when a certain when there be a certain quality to all the antecedent when they be all parallel and when the last modifier equally sensibly refers to them all right and that that be a situation so that series qualifier rule be in some sense a rule about when the last antecedent rule do not apply so i guess i would ask you to comment on that ,253.86,Roberts Court,"Nov 3, 2015",Avondale Lockhart,United States,14-8358,"May 26, 2015","Mar 1, 2016",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1

So the court is doing exactly what the court has authority to do, but this intervenor can contribute to the way the court is thinking about the case. So putting -- putting intervenors aside, suppose ten plaintiffs got together and brought a suit, so they were all joined in the same suit. And the district court satisfied itself that one of those plaintiffs had standing, that there was a proper case in controversy before the court, that nobody else was asking for anything else or making any other claims. Does the district court have to go plaintiff by plaintiff by plaintiff by plaintiff, sua sponte, and decide whether each of them has standing? I think it is very odd that you can be an actual party. And presumably, you can do all of these things, you can do -- do your own discovery, you can do -- and -- and that's fine with you, but if you're named as an intervenor, then it becomes not fine. Well, that's great. I mean, given that that's true, do you think -- are you saying that Congress had it in mind to track the requirements of standing, whatever they turned out to be? Because, of course, the Standing Doctrine in 1966 was nothing like what it is now.

2016,TC Heartland LLC v. Kraft Food Brands Group LLC,114,Elena Kagan,"What do -- What do you think Congress would have to do to reverse our decision in Fourco? Is there any way Congress could do it without repealing 1400? Is there any change that Congress could make to 1391 that would have that effect. That -- that would do it? In other words, your argument in the end rests on that ""except"" provision? But, Mr. Dabney, I mean, one oddity of this case is -- is usually, when we say something, when we issue a decision, we can be pretty confident that Congress is acting against the backdrop of that -- that decision. But I think that that would be an odd thing to say in this case, given that for 30 years the Federal Circuit has been ignoring our decision and the law has effectively been otherwise. And then the question is, well, what is the backdrop against which Congress is legislating. It seems actually that if -- if I were a congressman, I'd think that the practical backdrop against which I'm legislating is not Fourco; it is instead the Federal Circuit's decision in VE Holding, which is the decision that the practice has conformed to. Well, but for more than 30 years the practice has been the other way. I mean, I'm -- I'm -- I was thinking as I was reading the briefs, sometimes we have accidental theme days at the Supreme Court. So today's accidental theme is: When 30 years of practice goes against you, what happens? (Laughter.) But I thought the ALI -- and you -- you rely upon it in your briefs a lot and you rely on it here. I mean, the ALI wanted to get rid of 1400, and Congress didn't do that. But, Mr. Jay, can I just ask you -- and this is a clarification question, and maybe I should know this. But you have the original 1391, which was the subject of Fourco. Then you have the 1988 amendment. Then you have the 2011 amendment? Is it the 2011 amendment that you think changed things, or is it also the 1988 amendment? And if it's the 2011 amendment, exactly which words do you think changed the thing? So why is ""for all purposes"" different from ""for venue purposes"" or ""for purposes of venue"" under this chapter? Why isn't it all the same? Yes, but 1400 was within the chapter -- -- so the effect was exactly the same, wasn't it? But the complaint is that it allows a kind of forum shopping, right? That it -- you -- let's go down to Texas where we can get the benefit of a certain set of rules.

2016,Venezuela v. Helmerich & Payne International Drilling Company,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, the section -- I mean, the question here is -- that seems right. The question is whether a sovereign is entitled to immunity, and I guess I -- I would ask you to look at the statute, and to try to explain to me your reading of the language in the statute. So the statute says ""a foreign state shall not be immune... in any case... in which rights in property taken in violation of international law are in issue."" Right? Now, it seems to me that you are reading this statute as if it said that a foreign state shall not be immune in any case in which rights and property have been taken in violation of international law. In other words, you're taking out the ""are in issue"" language and suggesting that the question at the threshold is -- is -- is whether the rights and property, in fact, have been taken, rather than whether they are in dispute. Well, what -- what is left to be in issue, if you've already decided that there is a right on property and it has -- and that it has been taken in violation of international law? I think I'm just -- I'm just missing what -- and maybe I'm just missing it. But this -- it seems it's a funny way of writing this if you're right. If you're right, Congress should just have said, well, a foreign State shall not be immune in any case in which there's a right in property taken -- that has been taken in violation of international law. What is the ""are in issue"" language doing, except to say that the inquiry is whether there is a dispute about whether there's a violation of international law? Your response to Justice Breyer suggests that it's not only a question of legal sufficiency -- and I think that the government specifically says this in its brief -- -- that you would also have a factual -- any factual disputes addressed at that time. So if there are factual disputes, you know, there's -- there's a pleading. It's -- it is legally sufficient, but a defendant can come in and say, well, it might be legally sufficient, but the facts are just wrong. And you would have that at the jurisdictional stage too; is that right? So I'm going to ask you -- I'm sorry. And you think it's -- it's taken in violation of international law, and that's also a predicate for what's in issue; is that right? Well, I guess the question is, though, what's left to be in issue? If you're right that the question of whether there is a right in property is decided at the jurisdictional stage, both law and fact, and if you are right that the question of whether that right in property has been taken in violation of international law is also decided, both law and fact, at the jurisdictional stage, then what is the issue, the in issue, that's left for the merits? I guess I'm not understanding the distinction. Could you -- in this case, what would be the first question that would be the threshold question as to a right in property, and what would be the question that would get diverted to the merit stage? And what's the question that would be answered at the merit stage? Yeah, but they -- And you say that for the commercial nexus, right? So what is the difference? In other words, you're saying the commercial nexus language, you have to establish the fact early on -- -- at the jurisdictional phrase because of the way that's written in the statute. Because it doesn't have the language. Ms. Carroll, I -- though I have a good deal of sympathy with the way you read the language, but it does seem to me it gets you into one big problem. So, you know, take a case where there is an arguable claim that there's been a violation of international law, so you would satisfy the Bell v. Hood standard, but then the actual claim that's being made is just a straight conversion claim. So you've -- you've gotten to the merits, but in the merits stage all you're talking about is this conversion claim. And so you could be adjudicated guilty even though nobody has decided, in fact, whether you violated international law. And that seems as though it cannot be right. Do you -- sorry, I'm sorry. I see. So you think that's necessarily a merits issue. And if I could go back to Justice Breyer's question. I hate to ask you to repeat yourself, but if I could understand your -- your view of why it matters, is one 12(b)(1) motions, it's -- it's not clear whether one can waive defenses? And what else? ",well the section i mean the question here be that seem right the question be whether a sovereign be entitle to immunity and i guess i i would ask you to look at the statute and to try to explain to me your reading of the language in the statute so the statute say a foreign state shall not be immune in any case in which right in property take in violation of international law be in issue right now it seem to me that you be read this statute as if it say that a foreign state shall not be immune in any case in which right and property have be take in violation of international law in other word you be take out the be in issue language and suggest that the question at the threshold be be be whether the right and property in fact have be take rather than whether they be in dispute well what what be leave to be in issue if you have already decide that there be a right on property and it have and that it have be take in violation of international law i think I be just I be just miss what and maybe I be just miss it but this it seem it be a funny way of write this if you be right if you be right congress should just have say well a foreign state shall not be immune in any case in which there be a right in property take that have be take in violation of international law what be the be in issue language do except to say that the inquiry be whether there be a dispute about whether there have a violation of international law your response to justice breyer suggest that it be not only a question of legal sufficiency and i think that the government specifically say this in its brief that you would also have a factual any factual dispute address at that time so if there be factual dispute you know there be there be a pleading it be it be legally sufficient but a defendant can come in and say well it might be legally sufficient but the fact be just wrong and you would have that at the jurisdictional stage too be that right so I be go to ask you I be sorry and you think it be it be take in violation of international law and that be also a predicate for what be in issue be that right well i guess the question be though what be leave to be in issue if you be right that the question of whether there be a right in property be decide at the jurisdictional stage both law and fact and if you be right that the question of whether that right in property have be take in violation of international law be also decide both law and fact at the jurisdictional stage then what be the issue the in issue that be leave for the merit i guess I be not understand the distinction could you in this case what would be the first question that would be the threshold question as to a right in property and what would be the question that would get divert to the merit stage and what be the question that would be answer at the merit stage yeah but they and you say that for the commercial nexus right so what be the difference in other word you be say the commercial nexus language you have to establish the fact early on at the jurisdictional phrase because of the way that be write in the statute because it do not have the language ms carroll i though i have a good deal of sympathy with the way you read the language but it do seem to me it get you into one big problem so you know take a case where there be an arguable claim that there be be a violation of international law so you would satisfy the bell v hood standard but then the actual claim that be be make be just a straight conversion claim so you have you have get to the merit but in the merit stage all you be talk about be this conversion claim and so you could be adjudicate guilty even though nobody have decide in fact whether you violate international law and that seem as though it can not be right do you sorry I be sorry i see so you think that be necessarily a merit issue and if i could go back to justice breyer s question i hate to ask you to repeat yourself but if i could understand your your view of why it matter be one b motion it be it be not clear whether one can waive defense and what else ,256.51,Roberts Court,"Nov 2, 2016","Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, et al.","Helmerich & Payne International Drilling Company, et al.",15-423,"Jun 28, 2016","May 1, 2017",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2016,Endrew F. v. Douglas County School District,114,Elena Kagan,"How so -- But for those -- But for those of us who have some feeling that the word ""equality"" is a poor fit for this statute and its focus on individuation -- -- what would you say to those of us? How would you describe what you think is required without focusing on equality? So we should come up with our own that can then be applied in different ways in different courts. (Laughter.) But the procedures, as I'm sure you'll agree, is geared towards something. It's geared towards the provision of a free appropriate public education. Then the Act, what it does, is it sets up -- this is why I -- I guess I -- I -- I can't readily agree with your understanding of it's all procedures and we just have to make sure the procedures are followed, because what the Act does is it sets up an administrative process. And it says when you have disagreements about the provision of a -- of a FAPE, you go to this administrative process. And what does the hearing officer do? I'm going to just read you, subject to another exception, ""A decision made by a hearing officer shall be made on substantive grounds based on a determination of whether the child received a free appropriate public education."" So that's what the dispute is ultimately going to be about. It might be about some procedures along the way, and maybe it will be solved just by saying follow the right procedures, but often not. Often, what the hearing officer is told to do, shall do, is to decide on substantive grounds whether a child has received a free appropriate public education. But your substantive standard is so low, is so easy to meet, and then you justify that. You say, don't worry about it because it's all in the process. But this provision, the idea of what a hearing officer is supposed to do, and then what a court is supposed to do, says it's not all in the process. There is a question of whether a student is receiving a -- a FAPE. Well, how does your position, Mr. Katyal -- you have a passage in your brief on page 47 which says, ""An IEP must have the goal of advancing a child in the general education curriculum and, to the extent possible, enable her to be educated in the school's regular classes."" And, to me, that sounds exactly like what the chief justice just said, that an IEP has to be reasonably calculated to do those things. And if it's not, then relief follows. That's wrong. This is not just a procedural guarantee. Yes, the IDEA has lots of procedures in it, but they're all geared towards a particular substantive result. And it's that substantive result that's the focus of the -- both the administrative process and then judicial review of what comes out of the administrative process. But if we -- -- consider all of them and we do none of them, that's just fine? Mr. Katyal -- Mr. Katyal, can you go back to Justice Ginsburg's question that I'm a bit confused of -- about for the same reason. You said something like, well, this -- this standard is -- is being applied with bite. So I'm just wondering, do you favor a standard with bite? Do you favor a standard with bite? Would that be ""some bite"" or ""somebite""? (Laughter.) Well, again, if somebody said to you, write a stature with -- write a standard with bite, I doubt you would come up with the words ""more than merely de minimis."" But the back end is what this case is all about. We are at the back end. And de minimis is not enough, you know. It's ""merely de minimis."" (Laughter.) ",how so but for those but for those of us who have some feeling that the word equality be a poor fit for this statute and its focus on individuation what would you say to those of us how would you describe what you think be require without focus on equality so we should come up with our own that can then be apply in different way in different court laughter but the procedure as I be sure you will agree be gear towards something it be gear towards the provision of a free appropriate public education then the act what it do be it set up this be why i i guess i i i can not readily agree with your understanding of it be all procedure and we just have to make sure the procedure be follow because what the act do be it set up an administrative process and it say when you have disagreement about the provision of a of a fape you go to this administrative process and what do the hearing officer do I be go to just read you subject to another exception a decision make by a hearing officer shall be make on substantive ground base on a determination of whether the child receive a free appropriate public education so that be what the dispute be ultimately go to be about it might be about some procedure along the way and maybe it will be solve just by say follow the right procedure but often not often what the hearing officer be tell to do shall do be to decide on substantive ground whether a child have receive a free appropriate public education but your substantive standard be so low be so easy to meet and then you justify that you say do not worry about it because it be all in the process but this provision the idea of what a hearing officer be suppose to do and then what a court be suppose to do say it be not all in the process there be a question of whether a student be receive a a fape well how do your position mr katyal you have a passage in your brief on page which say an iep must have the goal of advance a child in the general education curriculum and to the extent possible enable her to be educate in the school s regular class and to me that sound exactly like what the chief justice just say that an iep have to be reasonably calculate to do those thing and if it be not then relief follow that be wrong this be not just a procedural guarantee yes the idea have lot of procedure in it but they be all geared towards a particular substantive result and it be that substantive result that be the focus of the both the administrative process and then judicial review of what come out of the administrative process but if we consider all of them and we do none of them that be just fine mr katyal mr katyal can you go back to justice ginsburg s question that I be a bit confused of about for the same reason you say something like well this this standard be be be apply with bite so I be just wondering do you favor a standard with bite do you favor a standard with bite would that be some bite or somebite laughter well again if somebody say to you write a stature with write a standard with bite i doubt you would come up with the word more than merely de minimis but the back end be what this case be all about we be at the back end and de minimis be not enough you know it be merely de minimis laughter ,202.23999999999995,Roberts Court,"Jan 11, 2017",Endrew F.,Douglas County School District RE-1,15-827,"Sep 29, 2016","Mar 22, 2017",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2016,Manrique v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Rashkind -- Mr. Rashkind, as I hear you now, you're saying something different from what I understood your brief to be saying, so maybe I just -- I understood your brief to be principally arguing that this was a consequence of Rule 4(b)(2), and so far, I haven't heard you mention Rule 4(b)(2) Instead, what you seem to be saying is that regardless of Rule 4(b)(2), we should treat the initial judgment and the later judgment as though they are the same judgment. And 4(b)(2) doesn't have to exist for that argument to be correct. I'm not saying that argument is correct, but it's a different argument than the argument I understood you to be making in your brief. So which are you making? Did I understand you, Mr. Rashkind, to say earlier that you think you would have an argument even if 4(b)(2) didn't exist? In other words, and another way to say this is suppose we think that 4(b)(2) deals with a different situation from the situation that you're talking about. Do you still have an argument -- -- or is it dependent on 4(b)(2)? What's -- what's the argument that's exclusive of 4(b)(2)? That might be true, but still, aren't we to wait until Congress fixes it? Presumably, Congress sees problems; Congress fixes problems. And -- and you might be right that this is the kind of problem that Congress has fixed in the past, but that by itself doesn't seem to give us the ability to go fix it ahead of the time that they do. I think in Mr. Rashkind's reply brief, he represents that there was no awareness of the opportunity to appeal. I mean, the only thing that gives you pause in a case like this is just because usually, you only have to file one notice of appeal. You do get worried about, you know, traps for the unwary and a person who just won't understand that there's another stage in this process and needs to file a notice of appeal. As long as the Court is fulfilling its obligation of saying, okay, now, you know, if you have an objection to this, you need to file another notice of appeal, well, that solves the problem. But if the Court doesn't say it, it doesn't solve the problem. And apparently, that's what happened in this case. And Mr. Rashkind represents that his client didn't know of his opportunity to, or his need to appeal. In the civil context, am I right that sometimes you file a second notice of appeal but you're -- the rules waive fees? But not here? I mean, it's a little bit odd. In the civil context, fees would be waived for the second notice of appeal and -- and in the criminal context not. Mr. -- Where were you going? Well, maybe this would be a good segue. This -- this -- you understand the requirement of a notice of appeal to be jurisdictional. Do you understand the requirement of timeliness to be jurisdictional or not? Okay. Now, I understand it doesn't matter in this case -- -- because you objected. But in the criminal context, that's a non-jurisdictional rule. That's just a claims processing rule -- Is that correct? And are there requirements as to what counts as a notice of appeal? In other words, suppose I'm a defendant and I miss my 14 days, I don't file a notice of appeal within that time. Actually, I don't file it later; I file a brief. Does the brief count as a notice of appeal? In certain situations? Okay. But assuming that that's not just applicable to pro se situations, I file a brief; I file it late; the government doesn't say anything about it. The appeal goes forward? Okay.

2016,"National Labor Relations Board v. SW General, Inc.",114,Elena Kagan,"General Gershengorn, can I ask: As you read this statute, suppose you just took out these words ""notwithstanding Section"" -- ""Subsection (a)(1)."" What would then the effect of the statute be? But just focusing on text for a minute. If that's true, if the entire textual argument really does rest on the ""notwithstanding Subsection (a)(1)"" -- I mean, typically when you have a ""notwithstanding"" clause, it means, you know, take away Subsection (a)(1), not, you know, close your eyes to Subsection (a)(1) But it doesn't do anything more than that. So why do you think it should be taken to do something more than that in this case? But can I give you a hypo? So the hypo is, I'm at a restaurant, and I -- I'm talking to my waiter, and I place three orders. I say, number 1, I'll have the house salad. Number two, I'll have the steak. Number three, I'll have the fruit cup. And then I tell the waiter, notwithstanding order number three, I can't eat anything with strawberries. So on your theory, the waiter could bring me a house salad with strawberries in it, and that seems to me a quite odd interpretation of what's a pretty clear instruction: No strawberries. So I -- I take it, you know, you have some arguments, some strong arguments on -- on history and on practice, but, you know, again, I'm just sort of -- isn't that just a peculiar way to understand the, you know, notwithstanding order number three, no strawberries? Can I ask you about the consequences going backward? Your brief did not talk about this, but do you think that if we find against you, that that subjects to some uncertainty actions that these 100-plus officials took? If so, what actions? Suppose you didn't have those defenses, because, you know, I'm not sure why you would necessarily, given that the statute says they're void ab initio if people take it as against these procedures. So if you didn't have those defenses, as you look down the list of these officials, what kinds of actions are you most worried about being unsettled? Can I just press you a little bit? I mean, those are all very important positions that you named, but it's not absolutely clear to me that those -- that there are categories of decisions that those people take that we should be worried about. And if there are, I would like to know about those categories of decisions. Well, why do you -- why and how do you think that that change was made, then? Because the change clearly was made. In the initial draft, it obviously applied only to first assistants; and then in the final draft, not so obvious at all. And, you know, I agree with you there's no explanation, but there is a change. Are you suggesting it was, you know, just a mistake that somehow happened? I don't get that, Mr. Dvoretzky. And maybe this follows the government's line of thought, but, you know, I've been -- the (a)(1) says, ""The first assistant shall be the acting officer."" And then (b)(1) says, no, she may not be. Right? And (a)(2) and (a)(3) doesn't use the words ""shall,"" but it says, the President may appoint any of these people. And then (b) comes along and says, no, the President can't appoint some subset of them. So the basic conflict seems to me to be the same in both cases, which is that the second clause says not so fast, not with respect to those people. But those grants of discretion are very broad, and then (b)(1) again takes the person out, takes the person out of the grant of discretion, just as it takes the person out of the self-executing provision before them. I have to say, I find it a little bit odd to think of this drafter thinking of the kind of distinction you're making. Say, well, this is self-executing and this is not self-executing. It's only a broad grant of discretion. And then not realizing that just by virtue of saying ""notwithstanding (a)(1),"" the statute creates -- raises this question about, well, you've said (a)(1) but not (a)(2) or (a)(3) What does that mean? I mean, that seems just like a very strange drafter to me, somebody who is so in the weeds that they can't figure out that pretty obvious objection to what they're doing. Can I ask Mr. Dvoretzky about the post-enactment history? Because, you know, we're generally reluctant to demand that Congress objects to things. But on the other hand, the -- the history here is so strong. All of these appointments, 100-plus of them, in a time when Congress and the President -- I mean, this is -- this has been a time where there's been a lot of partisan bickering over appointments, and you would think that in that context, if anybody had thought that this statute could be read differently, we would have heard about it, and yet we hear absolutely nothing. So how do you explain that? I don't know. Wouldn't you say something like I don't like this nominee, and anyway, it's illegal for the President to make this nomination? Seems like it gives it some real extra oomph, right? (Laughter.) It's not just -- it's not just a matter of my preferences versus the government's preferences. Now the President's preference is illegal. It's off the board. Congress has said he can't do it. Who wouldn't say that in that circumstance? The way you described that, you sound a bit skeptical of those defenses. (Laughter.) ",general gershengorn can i ask as you read this statute suppose you just take out these word notwithstanding section subsection a what would then the effect of the statute be but just focus on text for a minute if that be true if the entire textual argument really do rest on the notwithstanding subsection a i mean typically when you have a notwithstanding clause it mean you know take away subsection a not you know close your eye to subsection a but it do not do anything more than that so why do you think it should be take to do something more than that in this case but can i give you a hypo so the hypo be I be at a restaurant and i I be talk to my waiter and i place three order i say number I will have the house salad number two I will have the steak number three I will have the fruit cup and then i tell the waiter notwithstanding order number three i can not eat anything with strawberry so on your theory the waiter could bring me a house salad with strawberry in it and that seem to me a quite odd interpretation of what be a pretty clear instruction no strawberry so i i take it you know you have some argument some strong argument on on history and on practice but you know again I be just sort of be not that just a peculiar way to understand the you know notwithstanding order number three no strawberry can i ask you about the consequence go backward your brief do not talk about this but do you think that if we find against you that that subject to some uncertainty action that these plus official take if so what action suppose you do not have those defense because you know I be not sure why you would necessarily give that the statute say they be void ab initio if people take it as against these procedure so if you do not have those defense as you look down the list of these official what kinds of action be you most worried about be unsettle can i just press you a little bit i mean those be all very important position that you name but it be not absolutely clear to me that those that there be category of decision that those people take that we should be worry about and if there be i would like to know about those category of decision well why do you why and how do you think that that change be make then because the change clearly be make in the initial draft it obviously apply only to first assistant and then in the final draft not so obvious at all and you know i agree with you there be no explanation but there be a change be you suggest it be you know just a mistake that somehow happen i do not get that mr dvoretzky and maybe this follow the government s line of thought but you know I have be the a say the first assistant shall be the acting officer and then b say no she may not be right and a and a do not use the word shall but it say the president may appoint any of these people and then b come along and say no the president can not appoint some subset of them so the basic conflict seem to me to be the same in both case which be that the second clause say not so fast not with respect to those people but those grant of discretion be very broad and then b again take the person out take the person out of the grant of discretion just as it take the person out of the self execute provision before them i have to say i find it a little bit odd to think of this drafter thinking of the kind of distinction you be make say well this be self execute and this be not self execute it be only a broad grant of discretion and then not realize that just by virtue of say notwithstanding a the statute create raise this question about well you have say a but not a or a what do that mean i mean that seem just like a very strange drafter to me somebody who be so in the weed that they can not figure out that pretty obvious objection to what they be do can i ask mr dvoretzky about the post enactment history because you know we be generally reluctant to demand that congress object to thing but on the other hand the the history here be so strong all of these appointment plus of them in a time when congress and the president i mean this be this have be a time where there be be a lot of partisan bickering over appointment and you would think that in that context if anybody have think that this statute could be read differently we would have hear about it and yet we hear absolutely nothing so how do you explain that i do not know would not you say something like i do not like this nominee and anyway it be illegal for the president to make this nomination seem like it give it some real extra oomph right laughter it be not just it be not just a matter of my preference versus the government s preference now the president s preference be illegal it be off the board congress have say he can not do it who would not say that

2016,"Coventry Health Care of Missouri, Inc. v. Nevils",114,Elena Kagan,"Before you do, I mean, we appeared to find this a difficult question in McVeigh. We said there were two plausible readings. We said it was a hard statute. We didn't want to decide as between the two. You know, what do you make of that case? But money is money, and, you know, one dollar is as good as the next. And the question is -- I think what Justice Alito is saying; I'll just say it my way -- is one way -- say you're in a car accident. One way you get all the hospital and medical costs that you incur, and the other way you get those costs minus any recovery in a tort suit. So maybe a recovery won't happen in a tort suit, but a recovery might happen in a tort suit and then you get considerably less. But, for example, just a couple of years ago, we said with respect to an express-preemption clause, we said that the presumption against preemption just didn't apply in a case like this -- like that; that it was only applicable in a case of implied preemption. So that was just a careless statement -- -- on our part? I think I don't quite understand your -- your answer to Justice Alito's first question. I think he gave you a statute something along the lines of this Federal law preempts and supersedes any State law that conflicts with these kinds of contracts. And you said that would not be subject to your constitutional concerns; is that right? Because those contracts are just as indefinite as the -- as the contracts in this -- -- statute written here. Well, but that -- that, again, is true of ERISA, too. ERISA is a statute that says this Federal law displaces these State laws because they conflict with a bunch of contract terms.

2016,State Farm Fire and Casualty Co. v. U.S. ex rel. Rigsby,114,Elena Kagan,"I -- please. Sorry. No, please. You mentioned Hallstrom a couple of times -- -- and rely on it heavily in the briefs. But Hallstrom has very different statutory language. Hallstrom says no action may be commenced unless a condition is met. And, similarly, in 3730, the statute uses language that makes it clear that dismissal is appropriate when a mandatory requirement is not met. It says, ""the Court shall dismiss an action or claim."" It says, ""in no event may a person bring an action."" It says the court -- ""no court shall have jurisdiction."" All of that way of -- all of those phrasings indicate what happens when a requirement isn't satisfied. But there is no such language with respect to this requirement. I mean, it's a mandatory requirement, but it doesn't say what happens if the requirement isn't satisfied. And that makes it very different from Hallstrom and from the other language in Section 3730. You said your test would put -- would make bad faith primary. What exactly does that mean? I mean, take a case where there was bad faith, but in fact there was also a pretty minor breach that was not likely to cause any harm, and in fact did not cause any harm, and the government comes in to the district court and says, it's not in our interests for this case to be dismissed. Why should the Court nonetheless dismiss the case? Well, then, what does it mean for bad -- why do you say -- is it -- how is it first among equals? Why isn't it just something that a district court should take into account as this district court took it into account? Well, but it did both. When -- when one factor is the seriousness of the violation, presumably one measures the seriousness of the violation by asking whether the violation is likely to cause harm ex-ante. So it's really looking to both. It's calling them different things, but it's saying, we're going to check out the seriousness of the violation, whether it's likely to produce harm, what the risk of harm is, and we're going to ask in ways we ask in the law all the time, did it in fact cause that harm? If there is a primary factor, why shouldn't the primary factor just be what the government wants? In other words, why shouldn't this be -- given that the government is the beneficiary of this provision, why shouldn't we give very significant discretion to the government? Do you think deference ought to be given to the government? And if so, as to what parts of the test? On actual harm? And do you think it might be helpful for this Court to clarify that when we're talking about the severity of the violation, part of what we are talking about is the likelihood that the violation might cause harm? ",i please sorry no please you mention hallstrom a couple of time and rely on it heavily in the brief but hallstrom have very different statutory language hallstrom say no action may be commence unless a condition be meet and similarly in the statute use language that make it clear that dismissal be appropriate when a mandatory requirement be not meet it say the court shall dismiss an action or claim it say in no event may a person bring an action it say the court no court shall have jurisdiction all of that way of all of those phrasing indicate what happen when a requirement be not satisfy but there be no such language with respect to this requirement i mean it be a mandatory requirement but it do not say what happen if the requirement be not satisfy and that make it very different from hallstrom and from the other language in section you say your test would put would make bad faith primary what exactly do that mean i mean take a case where there be bad faith but in fact there be also a pretty minor breach that be not likely to because any harm and in fact do not because any harm and the government come in to the district court and say it be not in our interest for this case to be dismiss why should the court nonetheless dismiss the case well then what do it mean for bad why do you say be it how be it first among equal why be not it just something that a district court should take into account as this district court take it into account well but it do both when when one factor be the seriousness of the violation presumably one measure the seriousness of the violation by ask whether the violation be likely to because harm ex ante so it be really look to both it be call them different thing but it be say we be go to check out the seriousness of the violation whether it be likely to produce harm what the risk of harm be and we be go to ask in way we ask in the law all the time do it in fact because that harm if there be a primary factor why should not the primary factor just be what the government want in other word why should not this be give that the government be the beneficiary of this provision why should not we give very significant discretion to the government do you think deference ought to be give to the government and if so as to what part of the test on actual harm and do you think it might be helpful for this court to clarify that when we be talk about the severity of the violation part of what we be talk about be the likelihood that the violation might because harm ,161.22,Roberts Court,"Nov 1, 2016",State Farm Fire and Casualty Co.,"United States ex rel.

2016,Lewis v. Clarke,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, why shouldn't we? I mean, you suggest the difference is because this is a voluntary agreement. But why shouldn't it be the rule that if the State pays, we should understand it to be a suit against the State. I -- I think you're right, Mr. Miller. I think we would have to change our law to say something like that. I'm just asking, like what -- why wouldn't that be a sensible rule? So those kinds of considerations haven't prevented us from looking to who's ultimately going to pay the bills in the kinds of cases that Justice Alito was talking about. Is it always the case that the plaintiff simply gets to choose whether it wants to proceed in an individual capacity or in an official capacity, or are there constraints at all on that choice? No, right. But -- but -- Do you think that might have happened here in the court below, in the Connecticut courts, that those two concepts were confused? Well, that's entirely contingent. It might be true in this case, but it doesn't have to be true. Another tribe could say, no, we don't feel like stepping in. Do you think, Mr. Miller, that there's any decision that precludes us from saying that we're going to treat this as sovereign immunity or not sovereign immunity depending on an -- an indemnification agreement?

2016,Moore v. Texas,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, Mr. Sloan, can I -- We wouldn't need that, would we, Mr. Sloan? We could say that the Briseno standards are in conflict with the old Atkins standards, as well as the new ones. There wouldn't need to be a difference between the old ones and the new ones for you to win this case. Could I just make -- I'm sorry to interrupt, Mr. Sloan, but could I just make sure I understand that? Because what you're essentially saying is that the court of appeals said, you are barred from using new standards; you must use the Briseno standards. So the two are flip sides of the same coin, and what the holding was, is you must use Briseno standards. Now, your QP reflected their framing of the issue -- you can't use new standards; you must use the Briseno standards -- but you were just reflecting their essential holding, which is, we have this Briseno case and you have to use it. Mr. Sloan, I think it's more than that. Because it's not just you can't consult the current guidance and you have to go back to the '92 standard. It says, you have to go back to Briseno, and Briseno has these seven factors that are not consistent with the old standards, just as they are not consistent with the new standards. And can I ask whether you might be talking about two different things? And I might be wrong about this, but as I understand adaptive functioning, there are these particular areas of functioning that have been set out. And what the consensus is, is to say, well, if you have deficits in four of these areas, it doesn't matter that you don't have a deficit in another area. And that's what the consensus is. Now, within each area, people/psychologists can look at, you know, within an area -- -- to determine whether you have a deficit. Yeah, you have to look at what you can do and what you can't do to decide whether there is a deficit in that area. So the two things might not be in conflict at all. General, would you agree with this: That the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, in Briseno and other places, has made clear its view that -- that Texas can choose to execute people whom a -- a complete consensus, a 100 percent consensus of clinicians, would find to be intellectually disabled? Would you agree with that? I'm -- I'm asking about Briseno and other court of appeals' decisions. And I thought that you said this in your brief, that the -- that your view of the point of State discretion is that a person who everybody -- every clinician would find to be intellectually disabled, the State does not have to find to be intellectually disabled because a consensus of Texas citizens would not find that person to be intellectually disabled. Isn't that the premise of the court of appeals' decisions? Well, I guess I just don't understand this. And I really don't understand it in light of your brief, which I'm going to start to quote from pretty soon. But what the -- it seems to me what the Texas court did is to say, look, we're going to accept the three dimensions, the adaptive deficits and the IQ and the age. But with respect to the quality and the degree of impairment -- I think that that's their language -- we're not going to accept the clinicians' view so that people with mild impairment can be executed, even though the clinicians would find those people to be intellectually disabled. I know that they applied the three-prong test. The question is the degree of impairment as to each of these -- those prongs. And again, it seems to me pretty clear from your brief when you're talking about Atkins didn't establish a national standard, that you're saying too that the Texas -- and if you're not, I mean, I -- I guess I'm surprised by that -- that you're saying that the Texas courts do need to follow clinical assessments of intellectual impairment? Because that's -- it's just not what you say on page 19 and 20 and 21 of your brief. Well, he was talking about my question. So go on. (Laughter.) I have a follow-up unless you want to go, Justice Sotomayor. Let me just take one of the Briseno factors, right? And it's the idea that what lay people think about the person growing up is relevant to an assessment of adaptive function. Now, no clinician would ever say that. The clinicians say, no, that's sort of like stereotypical layperson view of adaptive functioning, which is different from the -- the clinical view of adaptive functioning. But the Briseno factors made very clear, sort of point one, that you're supposed to sort of -- that you're supposed to rely on -- on what the neighbor said and what the teacher with absolutely no experience with respect to intellectual disabilities said. So that seems to me a very big difference between the Briseno factors and the clinical view of intellectual disability. Because Briseno says essentially that this can trump everything, and it says that this can trump everything because of the underlying view of Briseno and other Texas Court of Appeals cases that we don't have to look at the clinical standards and that we can execute people whom clinicians would find to be disabled. I'm sorry, Mr. General Keller, because you keep on saying the three-prong definition, but the three-prong definition just tells you, you have to look to IQ, you have to look to adaptive functioning, you have to look to youth. It doesn't tell you anything about what qualities you look to and the extent of impairment within those factors, and that's where the Texas court has insisted upon its freedom to go out on its own. But the -- but the genesis of these factors was that the court said the clinical standards are just too subjective and they don't reflect what Texas citizens think, both of those things. They are too subjective, and they just reflect what clinicians think; they don't reflect what Texas citizens think. That was the genesis of the standards, which suggests that Justice Kennedy is right about how they operate and also how they were intended to operate. General, can I ask -- I'm sort of trying to reconcile the various statements you made here, and in your briefs, and here's what I come up with, and tell me if it's right. I think what you're saying is the Texas Court of Appeals is complying with Atkins because it used a three-pronged test, focusing on IQ and adaptive function and age. But within each of those prongs, in order to make this distinction between clinical disability and moral culpability within each of those prongs, the Court can choose how to apply that prong, and particularly what levels of impairment to use. Is that a fair assessment? Right. I -- yes, it has adopted the three-part test. But within each of those prongs, you get to apply it. I thought that that was the entire point of Hall: No, that's wrong. You don't get to apply it however you want. ",well mr sloan can i we would not need that would we mr sloan we could say that the briseno standard be in conflict with the old atkins standard as well as the new one there would not need to be a difference between the old one and the new one for you to win this case could i just make I be sorry to interrupt mr sloan but could i just make sure i understand that because what you be essentially say be that the court of appeal say you be bar from use new standard you must use the briseno standard so the two be flip side of the same coin and what the holding be be you must use briseno standard now your qp reflect their framing of the issue you can not use new standard you must use the briseno standard but you we be just reflect their essential holding which be we have this briseno case and you have to use it mr sloan i think it be more than that because it be not just you can not consult the current guidance and you have to go back to the standard it say you have to go back to briseno and briseno have these seven factor that be not consistent with the old standard just as they be not consistent with the new standard and can i ask whether you might be talk about two different thing and i might be wrong about this but as i understand adaptive functioning there be these particular area of function that have be set out and what the consensus be be to say well if you have deficit in four of these area it do not matter that you do not have a deficit in another area and that be what the consensus be now within each area peoplepsychologists can look at you know within an area to determine whether you have a deficit yeah you have to look at what you can do and what you can not do to decide whether there be a deficit in that area so the two thing might not be in conflict at all general would you agree with this that the texas court of criminal appeal in briseno and other place have make clear its view that that texas can choose to execute people whom a a complete consensus a percent consensus of clinician would find to be intellectually disable would you agree with that I be I be ask about briseno and other court of appeal decision and i think that you say this in your brief that the that your view of the point of state discretion be that a person who everybody every clinician would find to be intellectually disabled the state do not have to find to be intellectually disabled because a consensus of texas citizen would not find that person to be intellectually disabled be not that the premise of the court of appeal decision well i guess i just do not

be just not what you say on page and and of your brief well he be talk about my question so go on laughter i have a follow up unless you want to go justice sotomayor let me just take one of the

Is that -- is there -- there any difference between the tuxedo shirt and this? No. But it prevents you -- it prevents you from making this T-shirt with these lines on it in the same way that you're saying nobody should be able to make a short dress -- -- with those particular lines in that particular place. But you're saying you couldn't make the tuxedo shirt -- is that correct? -- or you could? So but if I could just go back and make sure I understand my question about the tuxedo shirt. If I have a copyright in the design of the tuxedo shirt, not in a tuxedo -- -- I have a copyright in the design of a tuxedo shirt, can I prevent other people from manufacturing tuxedo shirts? So why isn't that exactly the same? Because here, I have a design in a copyright dress, and now I'm trying to prevent other people from manufacturing that cheerleader dress with that design. I don't understand why it's like manufacturing a tuxedo. It seems as though it's like manufacturing the thing that I have the design in. I have design in the -- I have a design of a tuxedo shirt, so you can't make a tuxedo shirt. I have a design in a cheerleader dress, so you can't make the cheerleader dress. Well, I guess that's the question, is it really in any way, because the opposite way of reading this statute is that the ""utilitarian aspects"" of the article that you're talking about in terms of the separability test? That -- that those ""utilitarian aspects"" should be understood to encompass only the utilitarian functions that make something a useful article in the first place, which means that they should be held to exclude things that relate to the -- portraying the appearance of the article or things that relates to conveying information, and that seems to me a pretty good -- I mean, it's a confusing statute, but it seems to me a pretty good holistic understanding of this statute. But that is what this statute is trying to do, is to say there are certain kinds of things that might in a broad sense be considered utilitarian, which has to do with portraying appearance or conveying information, that, for this inquiry, we want you to exclude, that the separability test does not relate to those kinds of things. But the reason why camouflage is such a good example for your side is that camouflage actually -- we can understand it as having a utilitarian function that is different from simply conveying information and it is different from simply making something appear a certain way. In other words, the utilitarian function that camouflage has is to hide you in the woods. And so -- so that function would not be excluded by these things. Mr. Jay, see -- Mr. Jay, can I -- And isn't it -- just starting from the premise that Justice Alito suggested, the -- fabric designs are copyrightable; is that correct? Everybody agrees with that. So it seems to me that the question, right, in this case, is are you going to treat this kind of design just as you would a fabric design? And as I understand Mr. Bursch's point, what Mr. Bursch is saying is, no, you shouldn't, because this kind of design has -- it -- it follows the figure of a human body, essentially. And that's the difference between just a design of like stripes and zigzags and chevrons sort of abstractly, and then one that's put on something that looks like a particular piece of apparel that's meant to fit onto a human body in a particular way. And that seems to me to be the -- the distinction he's making, and I want you to tell me why that distinction, in your view, doesn't make a difference. And when you say ""this design"" -- I'm sorry, Mr. Jay. When you say ""this design,"" just to make sure I understand what you're claiming copyright in, so if I'm looking at page 4 and there's this design with a blue stripe and a white stripe and a red stripe and a white stripe and a blue stripe, could somebody else come along and just add another red stripe to that? And would that -- would you then say you violated our copyright? The particular arrangement. So if somebody just added a different, another stripe. That's so romantic. Well, what do you do in Mr. Bursch's examples of military uniforms or police officer uniforms, something like that? Well, that seems a problem. But on the other hand, it seems a little bit strange that, you know, take a garment designer who wants to do a design that is slimming. And if -- there are all kinds of structural things you can do that are slimming, and those would not be copyrightable. Then you're saying that the -- that the placement of stripes or color, that is copyrightable, even though the garment designer is really trying to do the same thing through color and through graphic design as he was doing through the shape of the article. Well, can't the school just go to somebody who puts the zigzag where the chevron was, or the chevron where the zigzag was, or makes it a couple of different colors or adds another stripe? I mean, there's this -- my clerk found -- I'm sorry. Just add that -- I'm done with my question. ",how be your argument different from this tuxedo shirt that the government talk about it be on page of the government s brief where the line really do have to be just in a particular place on the piece of apparel in order for it to make any sense at all and in there that be find to be copyrightable be that be there there any difference between the tuxedo shirt and this no but it prevent you it prevent you from make this t shirt with these line on it in the same way that you be say nobody should be able to make a short dress with those particular line in that particular place but you be say you could not make the tuxedo shirt be that correct or you could so but if i could just go back and make sure i understand my question about the tuxedo shirt if i have a copyright in the design of the tuxedo shirt not in a tuxedo i have a copyright in the design of a tuxedo shirt can i prevent other people from manufacture tuxedo shirt so why be not that exactly the same because here i have a design in a copyright dress and now I be try to prevent other people from manufacture that cheerleader dress with that design i do not understand why it be like manufacture a tuxedo it seem as though it be like manufacture the thing that i have the design in i have design in the i have a design of a tuxedo shirt so you can not make a tuxedo shirt i have a design in a cheerleader dress so you can not make the cheerleader dress well i guess that be the question be it really in any way because the opposite way of read this statute be that the utilitarian aspect of the article that you be talk about in term of the separability test that that those utilitarian aspect should be understand to encompass only the utilitarian function that make something a useful article in the first place which mean that they should be hold to exclude thing that relate to the portray the appearance of the article or thing that relate to convey information and that seem to me a pretty good i mean it be a confusing statute but it seem to me a pretty good holistic understanding of this statute but that be what this statute be try to do be to say there be certain kind of thing that might in a broad sense be consider utilitarian which have to do with portray appearance or convey information that for this inquiry we want you to exclude that the separability test do not relate to those kind of thing but the reason why camouflage be such a good example for your side be that camouflage actually we can understand it as have a utilitarian function that be different from simply convey information and it be different from simply make something appear a certain way in other word the utilitarian function that camouflage have be to hide you in the wood and so so that function would not be exclude by these thing mr jay see mr jay can i and be not it just start from the premise that justice alito suggest the fabric design be copyrightable be that correct everybody agree with that so it seem to me that the question right in this case be be you go to treat this kind of design just as you would a fabric design and as i understand mr bursch s point what mr bursch be say be no you should not because this kind of design have it it follow the figure of a human body essentially and that be the difference between just a design of like stripe and zigzag and chevron sort of abstractly and then

another red stripe to that and would that would you then say you violate our copyright the particular arrangement so if somebody just add a different another stripe that be so romantic well what do you do in mr bursch s example of military uniform or police officer uniform something like that well that seem a problem but on the other hand it seem a little bit strange that you know take a garment designer who want to do a design that be slimming and if there be all kind of structural thing you can do that be slimming and those would not be copyrightable then you be say that the that the

2016,Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Superior Court of California,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Katyal, could we go back to a form of Justice Kennedy's first question, which is, just could you explain what defendant's interests are at stake here? In other words, you know, usually we've looked to fairness for the defendant when we make the due process inquiry. So what is the unfairness here, given that there is another suit that's going to be going forward in California, and what Mr. Goldstein wants is just for additional claims of the exact same kind to be joined to that suit? So could we just start with the fairness? You've timed it. But it seems you're conflating two things, Mr. Katyal. I mean, individual -- a lot of individual California claims can be joined, and then we can have an argument about what should probably be joined and what can go off individually. But -- but that's a different question than the question in this case, which is, why is it unfair to glom on Texas claims and New York claims to the California claims, once we already have a mass action which will have multiple injury trials? But you already know because this is a nationwide marketing that you do, nationwide drug, you already know that you're subject to jurisdiction in any of the 50 States and have to be prepared to confront jurisdiction in any of the 50 States. Well, I guess what I'm saying is that I -- the unfairness aspect of this is what I really want to drive at, because predictability just honestly doesn't seem like what's at issue here given that you know it's perfectly predictable to have litigation in any of the 50 States. So the question is, why is it unfair to have more litigation than you would in one of those States rather than another? Could you make this as concrete as you can for me? And I -- I'm assuming that your interests are the flip side to the plaintiffs' interests. So why is it that a person would choose to sue in California, and why is it that Bristol-Squibb does not want more suits than necessary to happen in California? I guess -- I guess I'm -- I'm feeling a little bit stymied here because I thought you were going to come at me with saying, look, the juries in California are different or there's punitive damages in California when there's not someplace else or the substantive rules might be different. And I'm not hearing any of that. So who -- which State are we worried about here? Are we worried about the plaintiff's State, or are we worried about the defendant's State? So on the plaintiff's side, that seems a pretty attenuated interest, if -- because usually when we say that the State has an interest, it's in protecting their own citizens and providing their own citizens with a forum. But here the citizen has decided he doesn't want that protection, he wants to go someplace else. It seems, you know, a little bit weak to say that the State has a very strong interest in protecting its own citizen that doesn't want to be there. But not necessarily to all the plaintiffs here. Well, how about the interest of the State that Bristol-Myers resides in? In other words, they might have an interest in not having their citizens hailed into court against their will in another part of the country. But that's like saying, Mr. Goldstein, that the claim relates to another claim that relates to contacts with the forum. I mean, I guess I'm -- I'm missing what the relationship is between an Ohio plaintiff's claim and the defendant's contacts with the forum that doesn't go through another claim. No, I understand that that's your point. But I guess what I've always thought that our personal jurisdiction cases require is somebody to state in -- state something like this: The plaintiff's claim relates to or arises out of the defendant's contacts with the forum State. So here, Bristol-Myers' contacts with California. And I just want you to tell me how an Ohio plaintiff's claim arises out of or relates to the defendant's contacts with California. Just it -- it does because why? Let me see if I understand that, because you're saying -- usually we say how does the claim relate to the contacts in a particular State, say in California. Here we can't answer that question, really. So we say now the contacts in California are nationwide contacts, and the plaintiff's claim relates to those nationwide contacts. Those nationwide contacts being a nationwide advertising campaign, a nationwide marketing campaign, and so forth. Mr. Goldstein, it seems to me, on your theory, it could be zero California plaintiffs, because here's what you told me. You told me that the reason that this -- that an Ohio citizen's claim arises out of the contacts in California is because the contacts in California are really nationwide contacts. And if that's so, it's met regardless of whether there are any California plaintiffs are not. So if that's your theory, it doesn't matter whether there are 86 or 20 or zero, because the contacts arise out of the nationwide/California contacts. The claim arises out of that. Yeah. I don't think that's right, Mr. Goldstein. Our arising out of relating to test, has always been about the first part of the inquiry, and then all of the four factors is a backstop to that. It's an additional test after we decide whether your claim arises out of the forum contacts. Can I take you back? Can I take you back to Justice Breyer's question about Federal courts -- -- and multidistrict litigation? Because you didn't say something that makes me think, if you didn't say it, I don't understand. Assuming that there was subject matter jurisdiction, that there's diversity, it still it seems to me that the way -- there's no nationwide service of process here. So the Federal courts have to mimic the State courts; isn't that correct? ",mr katyal could we go back to a form of justice kennedy s first question which be just could you explain what defendant s interest be at stake here in other word you know usually we have look to fairness for the defendant when we make the due process inquiry so what be the unfairness here give that there be another suit that be go to be go forward in california and what mr goldstein want be just for additional claim of the exact same kind to be join to that suit so could we just start with the fairness you have time it but it seem you be conflate two thing mr katyal i mean individual a lot of individual california claim can be join and then we can have an argument about what should probably be join and what can go off individually but but that be a different question than the question in this case which be why be it unfair to glom on texas claim and new york claim to the california claim once we already have a mass action which will have multiple injury trial but you already know because this be a nationwide marketing that you do nationwide drug you already know that you be subject to jurisdiction in any of the state and have to be prepare to confront jurisdiction in any of the state well i guess what I be say be that i the unfairness aspect of this be what i really want to drive at because predictability just honestly do not seem like what be at issue here give that you know it be perfectly predictable to have litigation in any of the state so the question be why be it unfair to have more litigation than you would in one of those state rather than another could you make this as concrete as you can for me and i I be assume that your interest be the flip side to the plaintiff interest so why be it that a person would choose to sue in california and why be it that bristol squibb do not want more suit than necessary to happen in california i guess i guess I be I be feel a little bit stymie here because i think you we be go to come at me with say look the jury in california be different or there have punitive damage in california when there be not someplace else or the substantive rule might be different and I be not hear any of that so who which state be we worry about here be we worry about the plaintiff s state or be we worry about the defendant s state so on the plaintiff s side that seem a pretty attenuated interest if because usually when we say that the state have an interest it be in protect their own citizen and provide their own citizen with a forum but here the citizen have decide he do not want that protection he want to go someplace else it seem you know a little bit weak to say that the state have a very strong interest in protect its own citizen that do not want to be there but not necessarily to all the plaintiff here well how about the interest of the state that bristol myers resides in in other word they might have an interest in not have their citizen hail into court against their will in another part of the country but that be like say mr goldstein that the claim relate to another claim that relate to contact with the forum i mean i guess I be I be miss what the relationship be between an ohio plaintiff s claim and the defendant s contact with the forum that do not go through another claim no i understand that that be your point but i guess what I have always think that our personal jurisdiction case require be somebody to state in state something like this the plaintiff s claim relate to or arise out of the defendant s contact with the forum state so here bristol myers contact with california and i just want you to tell me how an ohio plaintiff s claim arise out of or relates to the defendant s contact with california just it it do because why let me see if i understand that because you be say usually we say how do the claim relate to the contact in a particular state say in california here we can not answer that question really so we say now the contact in california be nationwide contact and the plaintiff s claim relate to those nationwide contact those nationwide contact be a nationwide advertising campaign a nationwide marketing campaign and so forth mr goldstein it seem to me on your theory it could be zero california plaintiff because here s what you tell me you tell me that the reason that this that an ohio citizen s claim arise out of the contact in california be because the contact in california be really nationwide contact and if that be so it be meet regardless of whether there be any california plaintiff be not so if that be your theory it do not matter whether there be or or zero because the contact arise out of the nationwidecalifornia contact the claim arise out of that yeah i do not think that be right mr goldstein our arise out of relate to test have always be about the first part of the inquiry and then all of the four factor be a backstop to that it be an additional test after we decide whether your claim arise out of the forum contact can i take you back can i take you back to justice breyer s question about federal court and multidistrict litigation because you do not say something that make me think if you do not say it i do not understand assume that there be subject matter jurisdiction that there be diversity it still it seem to me that the way there be no nationwide service of process here so the federal court have to mimic the state court be not that correct ,345.42999999999984,Roberts Court,"Apr 25, 2017",Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.,Superior Court of California for the County of San

2016,Nelson v. Colorado,114,Elena Kagan,"If that's right, and this is the basic argument, it's our money by virtue of State law, and once the conviction disappears, why doesn't the State have to proactively return the money? In other words, why is it even required for the person to bring any kind of refund action against the State? So your complaint is not to the nature of this action and to exactly what you have to prove. You're saying that as soon as the conviction is vacated, the State has to put a check in the mail. No. I guess I'm asking, if your theory is right, why is even that necessary? If your theory is right, it seems -- I mean, you know -- you know, you might file a motion because the State hasn't done what it's supposed to do, but it seems as though the obligation on the State's part is immediately to put a check in the mail. Well, it -- it seems, Mr. Banner, that you could be approaching this in two ways. I mean, one is you could be claiming a substantive due-process right along the lines that Colorado said you were doing, and then you came back and said no. Now, if you were suggesting that you had a substantive due-process right, then surely tradition would be important. But in -- if you're looking at procedural due process, I would have thought that your argument is the simple one of: This is property under State law; it's -- it's my property, it's your client's property. And then we apply the Mathews test to determine what kind of procedure is due -- -- to get that property back. And tradition -- -- wouldn't be any part of that. What do States generally do if they've collected this money, they've paid it out to the victim, and then the conviction is overturned? Do they usually leave the money with the victim and just take it out of their general treasury, or do States try to take it back from the victim? Well, I think that that's just mistaken, General. They're saying that they have a general State law property right in the money. Now, do you disagree with that? Do you think that this is their money? Whose money is it? Well, why is it the State's money? But it's -- it's money that's conditioned on a valid conviction. And when that valid conviction goes away, it seems the most natural, obvious thing in the world to say that the State's right to that money evaporates at exactly the same moment. Why isn't that true? I'm not talking about due process. I'm merely just talking about whose money it is. Under State law, State property law, whose money is it? They say it's their money because there's no longer a valid conviction. You say notwithstanding that the valid conviction has been reversed, it's the State's money. I want to know why. Could you just sort of describe to me in sort of common sensical terms, you know, rather than point me to a sovereign immunity case or something, just in common sensical terms why is this the State's money? General, can I go back to what -- I'm sorry. I interrupted you midstream. That's the -- you said ""that's the question"" as though something big was coming up. (Laughter.) Okay. So you said to Justice Sotomayor, you said we agree that if this were their money, we would have to refund it in normal ways consistent with procedural due process. Okay. So it really all does depend on whether we think it's their money or it's your money. So if this were your money on this -- on the simple theory of, there once was a conviction, it once was valid, we collected the money at that time, and that makes it our money going forward forever and ever, no matter what happens to the conviction. If that's your theory, it's not only true, as the Chief Justice said, that you wouldn't have to provide any remedy or any process for getting that money back; right? You could just keep it and say, doesn't -- you can prove your innocence, you cannot prove your innocence. Too bad. It's our money. You agree with that. I think you said that to the Chief. And it would also be true, I would think, that even if that conviction were improperly gained, not just in the sense that it was later vacated, but let's say it was the State's fault that that conviction occurred; in other words, let's say, oh, I don't know, there was a Brady violation or something like that. It would still be your money. General, you said a couple of times that if -- if we were to look at this as this is not public property once the conviction is vacated, that instead it once again becomes the criminal defendant's property, the acquitted defendant's property, if that were true what kind of procedure would you have to set up to return the property, do you think? ",if that be right and this be the basic argument it be our money by virtue of state law and once the conviction disappear why do not the state have to proactively return the money in other word why be it even require for the person to bring any kind of refund action against the state so your complaint be not to the nature of this action and to exactly what you have to prove you be say that as soon as the conviction be vacate the state have to put a check in the mail no i guess I be ask if your theory be right why be even that necessary if your theory be right it seem i mean you know you know you might file a motion because the state have not do what it be suppose to do but it seem as though the obligation on the state s part be immediately to put a check in the mail well it it seem mr banner that you could be approach this in two way i mean one be you could be claim a substantive due process right along the line that colorado say you we be do and then you come back and say no now if you we be suggest that you have a substantive due process right then surely tradition would be important but in if you be look at procedural due process i would have think that your argument be the simple one of this be property under state law it be it be my property it be your client s property and then we apply the mathews test to determine what kind of procedure be due to get that property back and tradition would not be any part of that what do state generally do if they have collect this money they have pay it out to the victim and then the conviction be overturn do they usually leave the money with the victim and just take it out of their general treasury or do state try to take it back from the victim well i think that that be just mistake general they be say that they have a general state law property right in the money now do you disagree with that do you think that this be their money whose money be it well why be it the state s money but it be it be money that be condition on a valid conviction and when that valid conviction go away it seem the most natural obvious thing in the world to say that the state s right to that money evaporate at exactly the same moment why be not that true I be not talk about due process I be merely just talk about whose money it be under state law state property law whose money be it they say it be their money because there be no longer a valid conviction you say notwithstanding that the valid conviction have be reverse it be the state s money i want to know why could you just sort of describe to me in sort of common sensical term you know rather than point me to a sovereign immunity case or something just in common sensical term why be this the state s money general can i go back to what I be sorry i interrupt you midstream that be the you say that be the question as though something big be come up laughter okay so you say to justice sotomayor you say we agree that if this we be their money we would have to refund it in normal way consistent with procedural due process okay so it really all do depend on whether we think it be their money or it be your money so if this we be your money on this on the simple theory of there once be a conviction it once be valid we collect the money at that time and that make it our money go forward forever and ever no matter what happen to the conviction if that be your theory it be not only true as the chief justice say that you would not have to provide any remedy or any process for get that money back right you could just keep it and say do not you can prove your innocence you can not prove your innocence too bad it be our money you agree with that i think you say that to the chief and it would also be true i would think that even if that conviction we be improperly gain not just in the sense that it be later vacate but let us say it be the state s fault that that conviction occur in other word let us say oh i do not know there be a brady violation or something like that it would still be your money general you say a couple of time that if if we we be to look at this as this be not public property once the conviction be vacate that instead it once again become the criminal defendant s property the acquitted defendant s property if that we be true what kind of procedure would you have to set up to return the property do you think ,268.09,Roberts Court,"Jan 9, 2017",Shannon Nelson and Louis Alonzo Madden,Colorado,15-1256,"Sep 29, 2016","Apr 19, 2017",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2016,Packingham v. North Carolina,114,Elena Kagan,"Didn't -- Well, I take it -- I take it, Mr. Goldberg, that a part of what the State is saying here is that it doesn't have the capacity to do that. It doesn't have the capacity to check message-by-message or click-by-click what a person is doing. And in the absence of that, that some kind of prophylactic remedy is needed. And that's not unheard of in First Amendment law. I mean, if you think of a case like Burson, which is the 50 feet with -- -- in the polling places, that's kind of a prophylactic rule. So why wouldn't the same be appropriate here? Social networking, it includes Facebook, obviously; it includes LinkedIn; it includes Twitter; is that right? So -- so a -- so a person in this situation, for example, cannot go onto the President's Twitter account to find out what the President is saying today? Not only the President. I mean, we're sort of aware of it because the President now uses Twitter. But in fact, everybody uses Twitter. All 50 governors, all 100 senators, every member of the House has a Twitter account. So this has become a crucial -- crucially important channel of political communication. And a person couldn't go onto those sites and find out what these members of our government are thinking or saying or doing; is that right? But -- but -- I mean, yes, that narrows it. It -- it takes the nytimes.com out of the statute, but it doesn't take the sites that people use today, as I suggested -- whether it's Twitter or whether it's Facebook -- which have become incredibly important parts of our political culture, of our religious culture. If you ask, there are surveys that say how many Americans have communicated their faith on social networking sites in the -- in the past week, and it turns out that one in five. That's about 50 million Americans use this for religious community purposes. So whether it's political community, whether it's religious community, I mean, these sites have become embedded in our culture as ways to communicate and ways to exercise our constitutional rights, haven't they? But you're not making a conduct speech distinction, are you? I thought you had dropped that in your briefs. Mr. -- Mr. Montgomery, can I ask you a question that has to do with the law's exemptions? Because it just confused me when I was reading it. It seems that some -- some of what's exempted by the law seems, I have to say, some of the most dangerous stuff. So you exempt any website that provides only a chat room or only photo sharing. So why is that? Because if I would have said, like, where the most dangerous activity takes place, it's in chat rooms and via photo sharing. It just seems to exempt the stuff that's most easily used to -- to do exactly the things that this statute is meant to prevent. When you just said to Justice Ginsburg, well, maybe that would be unconstitutional if they included these things that are instead exempted, so you mean that there's a constitutional right to use Snapchat, but not to use Twitter? Well, I would have -- I would have thought that Snapchat is -- is -- maybe I have it wrong. I'm not any expert on this. But isn't Snapchat photo sharing? Yeah. So that falls under the exemption; right? So you can use Snapchat, but you can't use Twitter? Mr. Montgomery, I agree with you. That's your closest case. It's the one that I asked Mr. Goldberg about, because it's the only case that I know of where we've permitted a prophylactic rule where we've said not all conduct will have these dangerous effects, but we don't exactly know how to separate out the dangerous -- dangerous speech from the not-dangerous speech, so we're going to have a prophylactic rule. That is like one out of a zillion First Amendment cases that we've decided in our history. And as Justice Kennedy says, there are many reasons to think it's distinguishable from this one. How many people under 30 do you think don't use these sites to get all their information? Under 35? I mean, they're -- increasingly, this is the way people get everything that -- all information. This is the way people structure their civic community life. Where is that in the statute? Because I don't read the statute to impose that as a requirement. So tell me where you find that. Right. So (B)(iii). It -- it allows users to create web pages or personal profiles that contain information such as links to other personal web pages. So you're reading the ""such as"" as a requirement, but ""such as"" is not a requirement. ""Such as"" is just like here's an example, but you don't necessarily need this. Well, then you need an implied colon and an implied semicolon. And then another implied semicolon. And then another implied semicolon. But all this implying of punctuation marks, I mean, if you just read this, it's contain information such as a bunch of things, which none of which are necessary, but these are good examples of things that characterize allowing users to create web pages or personal profiles that contain information. That's your requirement. But ""such as"" does not mean ""each of."" You're reading it as though ""such as"" means ""each of.""

2016,Cooper v. Harris,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Clement, that passage in -- in Cromartie II says in a case like this one. And -- and it's pretty clearly following off analysis of -- in a case with purely circumstantial evidence, rather than direct evidence of race-based districting. I think you would have heard it, and it would have sounded different if the Court had really meant that in every case where the question was, is this politics or is this race, there was a requirement to present maps. That passage just would have read a lot differently. Well, the question is: Is it? Right? I mean, that's the question that the district court was trying to answer. Is it politics or is it race? If it's politics, it's fine; if it's race, it's not. And -- and so let's just take a hypothetical. Not this case, but let's take a hypothetical, which is: A State really does decide to do race-based districting. Says, we want to segregate all the African-American voters; this is the way we want to do it. But then they say, well, we'll -- we'll -- we'll justify it based on politics, because that sounds better, right? So -- and -- but -- but there's lots of direct evidence that, in fact, the justification is politics, but the true reason is race. Now, were you suggesting when you stood -- when -- when -- in -- in -- in your -- in your first statements there, were you suggesting that even if a plaintiff comes in and has all this direct evidence that they are really trying to do race, that the plaintiff has to present its own maps? But it's also a big thing to ask plaintiffs to come in with their own maps, if they have direct evidence that the State is doing race-based rather than politics-based districting. Not so easy, because we know that race and politics correlate. And the question is -- is not -- I mean, that's just a fact of the matter. But we've said, notwithstanding that, if race is your motive, you get one result; and if politics is your motive, you get another result. So these maps are actually hard to do, given the extent of correlation there is, but direct evidence of race-based -- which, I have to say, there really is some in this case, because the principal line-drawer says, they told me to get above 50 percent BVAP -- direct evidence, you know, that basically makes the case for somebody. But isn't -- isn't it -- Isn't there substantial evidence that Congressman Watt comes in and he sits on the witness stand and he says, I had a conversation with the map drawer and the map drawer said that my bosses told me I have to get up over 50.1 percent black votes. That seems like substantial evidence. A Congressman says -- reports on a direct conversation he's had with the map drawer, who -- who -- who says he has received orders from on high. And -- Well, why not? Did the State ever put on any evidence that that was necessary to avoid a retrogression problem under Section 5? And why is that? I mean, it seems like -- as though that's what they would say. Why -- why wasn't that at issue? What do you mean, you would have -- What is your view of when maps should be required? But I think they would -- they did present both theories. They said, proposed findings in McCrory, that it was purposely -- they purposely included a substantial number of African-American residents of Guilford County in CD12. The intentional placement of a significant number of black voters within CD12 establishes racial predominance. But because Senator Rucho apparently believed doing so was necessary to avoid retrogression for Section 5 purposes. Is that -- You didn't respond to it. ",mr clement that passage in in cromartie ii say in a case like this one and and it be pretty clearly follow off analysis of in a case with purely circumstantial evidence rather than direct evidence of race base districting i think you would have hear it and it would have sound different if the court have really mean that in every case where the question be be this politics or be this race there be a requirement to present map that passage just would have read a lot differently well the question be be it right i mean that be the question that the district court be try to answer be it politics or be it race if it be politics it be fine if it be race it be not and and so let us just take a hypothetical not this case but let us take a hypothetical which be a state really do decide to do race base districting say we want to segregate all the african american voter this be the way we want to do it but then they say well we will we will we will justify it base on politics because that sound well right so and but but there have lot of direct evidence that in fact the justification be politics but the true reason be race now we be you suggest when you stand when when in in in your in your first statement there we be you suggest that even if a plaintiff come in and have all this direct evidence that they be really try to do race that the plaintiff have to present its own map but it be also a big thing to ask plaintiff to come in with their own map if they have direct evidence that the state be do race base rather than politics base districting not so easy because we know that race and politics correlate and the question be be not i mean that be just a fact of the matter but we have say notwithstanding that if race be your motive you get one result and if politics be your motive you get another result so these map be actually hard to do give the extent of correlation there be but direct evidence of race base which i have to say there really be some in this case because the principal line drawer say they tell me to get above percent bvap direct evidence you know that basically make the case for somebody but be not be not it be not there substantial evidence that congressman watt come in and he sit on the witness stand and he say i have a conversation with the map drawer and the map drawer say that my boss tell me i have to get up over percent black vote that seem like substantial evidence a congressman say report on a direct conversation he have have with the map drawer who who who say he have receive order from on high and well why not do the state ever put on any evidence that that be necessary to avoid a retrogression problem under section and why be that i mean it seem like as though that be what they would say why why be not that at issue what do you mean you would have what be your view of when map should be require but i think they would they do present both theory they say propose finding in mccrory that it be purposely they purposely include a substantial number of african american resident of guilford county in cd the intentional placement of a significant number of black voter within cd establishes racial predominance but because senator rucho apparently believe do so be necessary to avoid retrogression for section purpose be that you do not respond to it ,218.27,Roberts Court,"Dec 5, 2016",,,15-1262,"Jun 27, 2016","May 22, 2017",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2016,Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado,114,Elena Kagan,"Can you -- you keep on being cut off before you get to the tiers of scrutiny, but -- (Laughter.) -- the cases where the court has said that a lawyer has to be allowed to ask on voir dire about bias, does that -- is that only true of racial bias, or is that true of any other kind of bias as well? I think it's -- I'm sorry. Is that -- is that right? It's just race you're saying? It's just race. And then Batson would be race and gender; is that right. So the idea would be the judge would say, we'll look at all this other evidence v. the defendant. I think that they would have found him guilty regardless. But that would be a kind of structural error. Presumably -- Presumably the judge faces the same situation if a juror comes in during proceedings, is that right, and then the judge has to make whether this is something real or not. Mr. Yarger, let's -- let's assume that that's true, that the State interests are basically the same, and also let's assume that the safeguards, voir dire, don't operate particularly differently. All right? So I'll just give you what -- what I think is the strongest argument on Mr. Fisher's side, which is that the -- that the interests in preventing unfairness of this kind are much greater; that that's really the difference, is the fact that verdicts based on race discrimination pose a harm that verdicts based on other kinds of unfairnesses, which exist in the world, and -- and are terrible, but still, that it's just not the same kind of harm. The one question is whether identity-based harms are different than other kinds of unfairnesses, as we've talked about in the Warger case, for example, or the one before that. And then another question is whether race -- racial bias is different from other identity-based bias, right? But -- but would you -- would you concede that identity-based bias is different from like, you know, the kinds of bias that we've discussed in other cases? But it's true that this is a Sixth Amendment case, but it seems artificial not to think about the Sixth Amendment issue as informed by the principles of the Equal Protection Clause. And in those principles, as we've always understood them, says that there's a special kind of harm in treating people worse and, I mean, and certainly, in punishing people because of their race. And maybe especially because race is so associated with particular stereotypes respecting criminality, that that's about the worst thing that you can do to a person, and it's also the worst thing that you can suggest about the criminal justice system, that it allows that to happen. So both of those two things, the harm to the individual for being punished because of your race, and the harm to society writ large. And that would, I think, be the -- the fact, yes, you're right the State interests are exactly the same, and voir dire functions pretty similarly. But it's just a different kind of harm. Ms. Kovner, and it seems there are two lines of cases which -- in which we've recognized that racial bias in a jury room is an especially important problem, and that there need to be special rules to address that problem. And the first line of cases is the ones that on voir dire say that a lawyer who wants to ask about racial bias on voir dire has to be able to ask about racial bias, and that we've applied to nothing else except for racial bias. And the second is the Batson line of cases where we've said we're going to prevent lawyers from doing what we otherwise allow them to do when striking jurors will lead to -- may lead to race bias in the jury room. Now, here, we have like a screaming race bias in the jury room. We have the best smoking-gun evidence you're ever going to see about race bias in the jury room, and notwithstanding that in these two lines of cases we've said there need to be special rules to address this prevalent and toxic problem in our criminal justice system, here, we're not going to do that. And the question is, why would this category of cases be different from those other two? It does strike me, though, that given that one of the rules is that a juror can, during deliberations, say something appropriate -- something inappropriate is happening here, to the extent that there is this chilling effect, and more -- why doesn't that produce the exact same chilling effect? I mean, it seems like it's such on the margins, what you're saying. Maybe you could put the question a little bit differently, because I understand why you don't want to say, well, it wouldn't apply to this or it wouldn't apply to that. But in what ways is race unique? ",can you you keep on be cut off before you get to the tier of scrutiny but laughter the case where the court have say that a lawyer have to be allow to ask on voir dire about bias do that be that only true of racial bias or be that true of any other kind of bias as well i think it be I be sorry be that be that right it be just race you be say it be just race and then batson would be race and gender be that right so the idea would be the judge would say we will look at all this other evidence v the defendant i think that they would have find him guilty regardless but that would be a kind of structural error presumably presumably the judge face the same situation if a juror come in during proceeding be that right and then the judge have to make whether this be something real or not mr yarger let us let us assume that that be true that the state interest be basically the same and also let us assume that the safeguard voir dire do not operate particularly differently all right so I will just give you what what i think be the strong argument on mr fisher s side which be that the that the interest in prevent unfairness of this kind be much great that that be really the difference be the fact that verdict base on race discrimination pose a harm that verdicts base on other kind of unfairness which exist in the world and and be terrible but still that it be just not the same kind of harm the one question be whether identity base harm be different than other kind of unfairness as we have talk about in the warger case for example or the one before that and then another question be whether race racial bias be different from other identity base bias right but but would you would you concede that identity base bias be different from like you know the kind of bias that we have discuss in other case but it be true that this be a sixth amendment case but it seem artificial not to think about the sixth amendment issue as inform by the principle of the equal protection clause and in those principle as we have always understand them say that there be a special kind of harm in treat people bad and i mean and certainly in punish people because of their race and maybe especially because race be so associated with particular stereotype respect criminality that that be about the bad thing that you can do to a person and it be also the bad thing that you can suggest about the criminal justice system that it allow that to happen so both of those two thing the harm to the individual for be punish because of your race and the harm to society writ large and that would i think be the the fact yes you be right the state interest be exactly the same and voir dire function pretty similarly but it be just a different kind of harm ms kovner and it seem there be two line of case which in which we have recognize that racial bias in a jury room be an especially important problem and that there need to be special rule to address that problem and the first line of case be the one that on voir dire say that a lawyer who want to ask about racial bias on voir dire have to be able to ask about racial bias and that we have apply to nothing else except for racial bias and the second be the batson line of case where we have say we be go to prevent lawyer from do what we otherwise allow them to do when strike juror will lead to may lead to race bias in the jury room now here we have like a scream race bias in the jury room we have the best smoking gun evidence you be ever go to see about race bias in the jury room and notwithstanding that in these two line of case we have say there need to be special rule to address this prevalent and toxic problem in our criminal justice system here we be not go to do that and the question be why would this category of case be different from those other two it do strike me though that give that one of the rule be that a juror can during deliberation say something appropriate something inappropriate be happen here to the extent that there be this chill effect and more why do not that produce the exact same chill effect i mean it seem like it be such on the margin what you be say maybe you could put the question a little bit differently because i understand why you do not want to say well it would not apply to this or it would not apply to that but in what way be race unique ,307.29,Roberts Court,"Oct 11, 2016",Miguel Angel Pena-Rodriguez,Colorado,15-606,"Apr 4, 2016","Mar 6, 2017",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2016,Samsung Electronics Co. v. Apple Inc.,114,Elena Kagan,"Could I really quickly make sure I understand that, that in other words, you're -- you're saying we should only look to what an article of manufacture is and not your other argument that there should be apportionment as to any particular article of manufacture. Mr. Fletcher, could you speak about this VW Bug example, because as -- as I understand Ms. Sullivan's answer, she said, well, that distinctive appearance, that distinctive shape, it's just -- it's still -- the article is only the body of the car. And -- and you say, no, there's a real question as to whether it is being -- the design is being applied to the car itself. So how would you go about thinking about that question, or how is a fact-finder supposed to, and under what instructions? Right. But let's talk about the hard cases. So you think that that question is not relevant to the first question. In other words, suppose I think that people who buy VW Bugs buy them because of the look of the car. But you think that that's only relevant at question 2 rather than at question 1, which is the question of whether it's the body or the whole car that the design is being applied to? Let's take a case -- and I think that the VW example is a good example for this reason -- where the thing that makes the product distinctive does not cost all that much. There's not been a lot of input. Somebody just -- some engineer or some graphic artist or whatever woke up one day and said I just have this great idea for an appearance. But that's the principal reason why the product has been successful. I mean, the car has to run, and it has to do all the other things that cars do, but the principal reason why the car has been successful has to do with this particular appearance, the design. As I understood the government, that does not come into the first inquiry. That does not come into the question of what is the article. It only comes into the second inquiry, which is how much of the profits are attributable to that article. Do you agree with that?

2016,Bank of America Corp. v. City of Miami,114,Elena Kagan,"But, Mr. Katyal, that suggests that when Congress passed the FHA, it was looking only at individual acts of discrimination to particular persons. But the FHA is a very peculiar and distinctive kind of anti-discrimination statute, which really is focusing on community harms, and we talked about this a lot in the Texas Housing case of a couple of years ago. So it's not just individuals who are harmed; it's communities who are harmed. And that's the basic idea of the entire statute, why Congress passed it. And here the cities are standing up and saying, every time you do this redlining and this reverse redlining, essentially a community is becoming blighted. And who better than the City to recognize that interest and to assert it. Well, but they are a person aggrieved under the -- given Congress' purposes in the Act, because they are saying, as you did this redlining, as you did this reverse redlining, our communities, the thing that makes us a city was becoming more and more blighted, and that's what we are trying to recover for, the -- the costs of responding to that, the -- the costs of not having revenues in order to carry out our services for that community and for others. Not parens patriae. This is their own interest in maintaining their communities free of the kind of racial discrimination that the Act says causes neighborhood blight. I'm sorry. I guess I don't understand why this isn't a segregation harm. Here, the City is saying, you've done this redlining; you've done this reverse redlining. It's not that it just causes various foreclosures all over the City; it's causing foreclosures in particular concentrated areas, and it's doing that because of racial segregation. And at the same time, it's preventing that racial segregation from ever being lifted because those communities are becoming more and more blighted and less and less capable of becoming integrated communities. So everything about this complaint is about racial segregation, it seems to me. So do you think everything I just said, if their complaint was written like that, that they could maintain a suit? Mr. Katyal -- Can I ask a separate question? We've been talking a lot about zone of interests and the question about whether the zone-of-interest test applies at all. Because you have three cases prior to this 1988 re-enactment of the old 1968 language. And in each of three cases -- in Trafficante, in Gladstone, in Havens -- the Court very specifically says that this language stretches to the limits of Article III. So Congress is amending the statute in 1988 against that backdrop. Why shouldn't we understand that to mean that the language means it stretches to the limits of Article III? I'm disabled from having thoughts on this subject. I guess I don't understand. I mean, we can argue about whether these were holdings and whether these were a dicta, and there are arguments on both sides of that. But here I am on Congress. I mean, suppose you were an advisor to a congressman. And the congressman said, okay. I don't really like this idea of going to the limits of Article III. I think we should limit it. You say, no worries. Just use the same language. And he says, use the same language? That language has been consistently understood to go to the limits of Article III. And you say, oh, no. Don't worry. It's dicta. And he says, okay. I feel relieved. We can now use this language. I mean, wouldn't you be fired? I don't read the -- the House Report that way. The House Report does refer to a couple of particular aspects of those cases. But the House Report seems to me to cut against you because it makes clear that Congress knew about those cases. And those cases are, of course, the cases which said that standing stretches to the limits of Article III. And if you really look at the legislative history of this Act, it's pretty clear that when Congress is acting in 1988, it took off the shelf a bill that was discussed in 1980. And in that bill, there was a lot of discussion about whether standing should go to the limits of Article III. And Congress was thinking of changing that language. And Drew Days, the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, and the HUD Secretary, they both come in and they tell Congress, if you change that language, it's a problem, because then you're cutting back on standing. And Congress decided not to change that language because it wanted, as Drew Days said and as the HUD Secretary said, to go to the limits of Article III. When you say that -- when you said to me that the complaints that I wrote would have been covered by the Act, do you think it also would fall within proximate-cause principles? But is one understanding -- like, I guess, when I started reading the briefs, I was confused about this, because there's one understanding of proximate cause, which is that usually proximate cause is about foreseeability and only foreseeability. Now, there are definitely places where we've said there's this additional directness requirement, but only in pretty discrete areas. And I guess I -- like I sort of come back to this notion that I think what our -- our precedent suggests is it's a little bit statute by statute as to whether proximate cause is a foreseeability inquiry and only that, or whether it has additional components. Well, that's a very broad statement, Mr. Gannon. What do you do, then, with the restaurant or the dry cleaner or the laundry or whatever that wants to sue for somebody else's discrimination? Perhaps -- please. ",but mr katyal that suggest that when congress pass the fha it be look only at individual act of discrimination to particular person but the fha be a very peculiar and distinctive kind of anti discrimination statute which really be focus on community harm and we talk about this a lot in the texas housing case of a couple of year ago so it be not just individual who be harm it be community who be harm and that be the basic idea of the entire statute why congress pass it and here the city be stand up and say every time you do this redlining and this reverse redlining essentially a community be become blight and who well than the city to recognize that interest and to assert it well but they be a person aggrieve under the give congress purpose in the act because they be say as you do this redlining as you do this reverse redlining our community the thing that make us a city be become more and more blighted and that be what we be try to recover for the the cost of respond to that the the cost of not have revenue in order to carry out our service for that community and for others not parens patriae this be their own interest in maintain their community free of the kind of racial discrimination that the act say cause neighborhood blight I be sorry i guess i do not understand why this be not a segregation harm here the city be say you have do this redlining you have do this reverse redlining it be not that it just cause various foreclosure all over the city it be cause foreclosure in particular concentrated area and it be do that because of racial segregation and at the same time it be prevent that racial segregation from ever be lift because those community be become more and more blighted and less and less capable of become integrated community so everything about this complaint be about racial segregation it seem to me so do you think everything i just say if their complaint be write like that that they could maintain a suit mr katyal can i ask a separate question we have be talk a lot about zone of interest and the question about whether the zone of interest test applies at all because you have three case prior to this re enactment of the old language and in each of three case in trafficante in gladstone in havens the court very specifically say that this language stretch to the limit of article iii so congress be amend the statute in against that backdrop why should not we understand that to mean that the language mean it stretch to the limit of article iii I be disable from have thought on this subject i guess i do not understand i mean we can argue about whether these we be holding and whether these we be a dictum and there be argument on both side of that but here i be on congress i mean suppose you we be an advisor to a congressman and the congressman say okay i do not really like this idea of go to the limit of article iii i think we should limit it you say no worry just use the same language and he say use the same language that language have be consistently understood to go to the limit of article iii and you say oh no do not worry it be dicta and he say okay i feel relieve we can now use this language i mean would not you be fire i do not read the the house report that way the house report do refer to a couple of particular aspect of those case but the house report seem to me to cut against you because it make clear that congress know about those case and those case be of course the case which say that stand stretch to the limit of article iii and if you really look at the legislative history of this act it be pretty clear that when congress be act in it take off the shelf a bill that be discuss in and in that bill there be a lot of discussion about whether standing should go to the limit of article iii and congress be think of change that language and draw day the assistant attorney general for civil right and the hud secretary they both come in and they tell congress if you change that language it be a problem because then you be cut back on standing and congress decide not to change that language because it want as drew day say and as the hud secretary say to go to the limit of article iii when you say that when you say to me that the complaint that i write would have be cover by the act do you think it also would fall within proximate because principle but be one understanding like i guess when i start read the brief i be confuse about this because there be one understanding of proximate because which be that usually proximate because be about foreseeability and only foreseeability now there be definitely place where we have say there be this additional directness requirement but only in pretty discrete area and i guess i like i sort of come back to this notion that i think what our our precedent suggest be it be a little bit statute by statute as to whether proximate because be a foreseeability inquiry and only that or whether it have additional component well that be a very broad statement mr gannon what do you do then with the restaurant or the dry cleaner or the laundry or whatever that want to sue for somebody else s discrimination

2016,Buck v. Davis,114,Elena Kagan,"But, for example, last year in a case called Welch, the question came up on the Certificate of Appealability, and we just said, well, of course he should have gotten a Certificate of Appealability because he's right. And similarly, we did the same thing, oddly enough, in one of the cases here. We did the same thing in Trevino. Yes, he should have gotten a Certificate of Appealability because he has the merits on his side. That's essentially what you would want us to do? I mean, that does leave on the table -- maybe this is what the Chief Justice was saying -- this question of whether the Fifth Circuit is just using the wrong approach and the wrong standards for the Certificate of Appealability question. Ms. Swarns, I would have thought that your answer would be that, you know, you think this is so -- such an extraordinary case, and that the Fifth Circuit got this so wrong, that it's the best proof that there is that the Court is -- is approaching the COA inquiry in the wrong way. If they reached the wrong result in this case -- -- it's because they are just not understanding what the COA inquiry is all about. He did exactly what you would have expected him to do. Given that Coleman was still on the books, you would have said it would be -- had been improper for him to ask for the relief that you are now suggesting that he should have asked for. At least it would have been futile with Coleman still on the books. Isn't this substantially different than Gonzalez? Wasn't it important in Gonzalez that the nature -- what the nature of the error was? In Gonzalez what the court said, the error is commonplace to -- lawyers misjudge time limits all the time. The one thing we know about this error is that it's not commonplace. Even the two people who called the Quijano as defense witnesses never themselves raised race as a cause -- as a reason for future dangerousness. Only this attorney who's been disciplined repeatedly for his malfeasance in representing clients, who one newspaper said if you want to ensure a death penalty, hire this lawyer. In that situation, isn't this that rare case that Gonzalez talked about? Mr. Keller, you know, some of the statistics that Petitioner have pointed us to -- in capital cases, a COA is denied in 60 percent of Fifth Circuit cases as compared to 6 percent of Eleventh Circuit cases, two roughly similar circuits where COA's are denied in capital cases ten times more in the Fifth Circuit. I mean, it does suggest one of these two circuits is doing something wrong. But this is the whole point, really. They are not supposed to be doing what you do when you decide an appeal. And they -- and they actually don't have jurisdiction to decide the appeal. I mean, they are supposed to be performing a gatekeeping function, not deciding the merits of the case. But if you said that that's because those -- that's -- it's more prejudicial when the prosecution introduces this? Is that what you said -- -- to Justice Ginsburg? That -- that's your basic theory? Yeah. But -- and -- and that makes it more prejudicial. That's your basic theory? Because I don't -- I guess if there's both points, tell me what the other point is because I guess I just don't understand that point. But it seems more prejudicial when the defense attorney uses it. I mean, prosecution, you have a jury sitting there, and it realizes that the prosecutor has an interest in convicting a person and in getting a -- a sentence that the prosecution wants, so everything is discounted a little bit. But when your own -- when the defendant's own lawyer introduces this, the jury is going to say, well, it must be true. Even the defendant's lawyer thinks that this is true. So, you know, who a.m. I to -- to argue with that? It seems wildly more prejudicial to me when the defense attorney introduces it. Yes. And the legal question here, right, is whether this ineffective assistance of counsel claim, which has never been heard by any court, is a strong one. And a strong one including that the ineffective assistance here is likely to be prejudicial, which it seems as though it's -- it's far more likely to be prejudicial when the defense counsel does it. People expect the State to use whatever aggravators it has at hand. Now, people don't expect the State to do something as improper as this, but the people who understand that not everything that the prosecution says about a defendant, you know, that people -- the jurors should -- should think about those claims seriously because the prosecution has interests of its own. But the defense counsel's interests are supposed to be with the defendant. I'm just repeating myself. If the defense counsel does it, I mean, you know, who is the jury to complain? ",but for example last year in a case call welch the question come up on the certificate of appealability and we just say well of course he should have get a certificate of appealability because he be right and similarly we do the same thing oddly enough in one of the case here we do the same thing in trevino yes he should have get a certificate of appealability because he have the merit on his side that be essentially what you would want us to do i mean that do leave on the table maybe this be what the chief justice be say this question of whether the fifth circuit be just use the wrong approach and the wrong standard for the certificate of appealability question ms swarns i would have think that your answer would be that you know you think this be so such an extraordinary case and that the fifth circuit get this so wrong that it be the best proof that there be that the court be be approach the coa inquiry in the wrong way if they reach the wrong result in this case it be because they be just not understand what the coa inquiry be all about he do exactly what you would have expect him to do give that coleman be still on the book you would have say it would be have be improper for him to ask for the relief that you be now suggest that he should have ask for at least it would have be futile with coleman still on the book be not this substantially different than gonzalez be not it important in gonzalez that the nature what the nature of the error be in gonzalez what the court say the error be commonplace to lawyer misjudge time limit all the time the one thing we know about this error be that it be not commonplace even the two people who call the quijano as defense witness never themselves raise race as a because as a reason for future dangerousness only this attorney who be be discipline repeatedly for his malfeasance in represent client who one newspaper say if you want to ensure a death penalty hire this lawyer in that situation be not this that rare case that gonzalez talk about mr keller you know some of the statistic that petitioner have point us to in capital case a coa be deny in percent of fifth circuit case as compare to percent of eleventh circuit case two roughly similar circuit where coa s be deny in capital case ten time more in the fifth circuit i mean it do suggest one of these two circuit be do something wrong but this be the whole point really they be not suppose to be do what you do when you decide an appeal and they and they actually do not have jurisdiction to decide the appeal i mean they be suppose to be perform a gatekeeping function not decide the merit of the case but if you say that that be because those that be it be more prejudicial when the prosecution introduce this be that what you say to justice ginsburg that that be your basic theory yeah but and and that make it more prejudicial that be your basic theory because i do not i guess if there have both point tell me what the other point be because i guess i just do not understand that point but it seem more prejudicial when the defense attorney use it i mean prosecution you have a jury sit there and it realize that the prosecutor have an interest in convict a person and in get a a sentence that the prosecution want so everything be discount a little bit but when your own when the defendant s own lawyer introduces this the jury be go to say well it must be true even the defendant s lawyer think that this be true so you know who am i to to argue with that it seem wildly more prejudicial to me when the defense attorney introduces it yes and the legal question here right be whether this ineffective assistance of counsel claim which have never be hear by any court be a strong one and a strong one include that the ineffective assistance here be likely to be prejudicial which it seem as though it be it be far more likely to be prejudicial when the defense counsel do it people expect the state to use whatever aggravator it have at hand now people do not expect the state to do something as improper as this but the people who understand that not everything that the prosecution say about a defendant you know that people the juror should should think about those claim seriously because the prosecution have interest of its own but the defense counsel s interest be suppose to be with the defendant I be just repeat myself if the defense counsel do it i mean you know who be the jury to complain ,299.3400000000001,Roberts Court,"Oct 5, 2016",Duane Edward Buck,"Lorie Davis, Director, Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Correctional Institutions Division",15-8049,"Jun 6, 2016","Feb 22, 2017",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

2016,Murr v. Wisconsin,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Groen, may I ask -- Mr. Groen -- -- can I ask just a clarifying question about your argument? One of the things that makes this case odd is that there are family members all around. Both sellers are the same family and the buyers are the -- but if I'm right, your argument would extend in the exact same way to a situation where you have two sellers who are completely independent of each other. Mr. Jones and Ms. Smith have nothing to do with each other. Another buyer comes in, also has no relationship with Mr. Jones or Ms. Smith, and that buyer would be able to make the exact same argument that the Murr family is making in this case. Am I right about your argument? You have -- -- two preexisting substandard parcels. Somebody comes in, buys both, but all the parties are independent of each other. And now the person who has bought these two standard -- substandard lots wants to build on them, and your argument would be the exact same. But that's a very -- That's a very different situation. In Palazzolo, all we said was that if the seller has a takings claim, it's not extinguished just because the property is transferred; that the buyer could have the exact same takings claim. But the Murr children are not asking for the -- for the -- they do not have the same takings claim as the Murr parents did; isn't that right? The parents could develop on Parcel E; the children can't. The parents -- let me try this again. For the parents, the two properties were two properties. It's only when the property becomes one property that this takings claim arises. But the -- The -- I'm sorry. The -- the -- the regulation here, the only thing that it affected for the Murr parents and for the plumbing company was their ability to sell to a buyer who wanted to combine these two lots. That was the only thing that was affected; isn't that right? But, Mr. Groen, one of the -- One of the oddities of your position is that you seem to be taking half of State law. In other words, you're saying well, there are these -- there are these lot lines, and everything has to depend on the lot lines because they've been legally approved. But there have been other things in this case that have been legally approved too, and one of them is this merger provision. And you seem to be saying: Well, we look to State law for the lot lines, but then we ignore State law for the question of when lots are merged. And why should we do that? If we're looking to State law, let's look to State law, the whole ball of wax. In other words, saying: Well, when I buy those two lots, they're really not two lots anymore. According to State law, they are one lot. Well, I -- I think that you're right, Mr. Groen. It's like the legal recognition of property. But the legal recognition of property has something to do with lot lines, and it also has something to do with when lots are merged, when two lots are merged into one. And why would we ignore that question of merger? And what would it take to be formally merged? Why? Because if the Court -- If the State can say we don't have to eliminate lot lines. All we have to do is to say the -- the lot lines don't have legal effect for some purposes. Well, again, I think -- -- Palazzolo depends on the buyers having the exact same takings claim as the sellers, which it seems to me does not exist in this case. But let me ask you a different -- a different way around the question, which is, whether you think reasonable expectations matter at all in your framework? Okay. But here, if I'm buying property in this area, I also know that there are these rules about when you can develop on substandard lots and how it is that contiguous lots are understood for purposes of that development potential. So why aren't I buying subject to those preexisting regulations? In other words, this is not a regulation that just happened to me when I was an owner. I'm buying subject to -- and property is a bundle of sticks; we know that, right, first year of law school. And I'm buying, you know, certain metes and bounds, but I'm also buying into a certain set of things about what I can and can't do on the property. So why isn't that perfectly consistent with my reasonable expectations? I'm supposed to know the zoning regulations, and when I buy a house, when I buy a piece of land, I'm buying subject to the preexisting zoning regulations. But -- So the usual way -- The usual way, Mr. Groen, or at least a frequent way in which this comes up is a developer buys a hundred acres of land, and that land is split up into 100 one-acre parcels. And let's say 15, one-five, percent of them are on wetlands and can't be built on. It makes an enormous difference whether we're going to say that those 15 percent are independent lots, because if they are, then the developer comes in and says you have to pay me for all of that. But if they're not, the developer is out of luck because it's only 15 percent of the whole. Isn't that right? Yes. Well, the subdivision has occurred with government approval, and the merger provision has occurred with government approval, saying that this shouldn't be understood in the case of substandard lots as independent. General -- General -- May I ask a question. The difference between you and the other folks on that side of the room is that they want to look at reasonable expectations, and State law, in part, defines those reasonable expectations, but they're allowing for the idea that other things might come in as well, and you're saying it's all and only State law. Now, I'm pretty sympathetic to the idea that preexisting State law really does influence quite a bit your expectations about what property you own and what you can do with it. But still, what's the harm of doing what the government and the county want rather than what you want in terms of saying the analysis should be a little bit more fluent, fluid, sure, State law matters, but maybe other the things matter too in a particular situation. ",mr groen may i ask mr groen can i ask just a clarifying question about your argument one of the thing that make this case odd be that there be family member all around both seller be the same family

2016,McWilliams v. Dunn,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Bright, even the terminology that you are using, both here and in your briefs, contains some ambiguity, because you keep saying, well, Ake established the rights to an independent expert. But ""independent"" can mean, really, the defense expert, or ""independent"" can mean independent of both the prosecutor and the defense. And what you are saying that Ake held was that it was a defense expert. But -- and there are certainly parts of the opinion that read like that. There's no question that when Ake talks about assistance over and over again, it reads like a defense expert. But the question is, did Ake really preclude the idea of a completely independent person, independent of both the State and the defense? Mr. Bright, can I ask you for your interpretation of -- there are two paragraphs on page 85 which talk about Smith v. Baldi, which was a case -- -- where there was, in fact, a neutral expert. And -- and -- and the court talks about why it doesn't have to pay attention to Smith v. Baldi. I'm just curious as to what your interpretation of these paragraphs are, because -- well, I'll just leave it like that. Sorry, General, but if we could just focus on -- because I think it would help to just sort of -- let's assume for the moment that this defendant did not get what he was asking for, which was a defense expert, and say whether Ake entitled him to such an expert. And I just want to sort of focus on the money sentence in Ake, you know, what -- the ""we therefore hold"" sentence. And it says -- here's what we hold. ""We hold that when the defendant makes this preliminary showing that mental health is going to be at issue, the State must assure the defendant access to a competent psychiatrist who will assist in evaluation, preparation and presentation of the defense."" So assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense. And, you know, recognizing that we're all smart people, and we can read any words, we can have an argument that any words mean anything we say, still, ""assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense,"" doesn't that mean, like, you know, that's what you -- that's the phrase you would use for a counsel, to assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense. It means somebody on the defendant's side. Well, they're capable in the sense that sometimes they might, but it's not what you would -- this is -- I -- I guess I'm repeating myself, but this is the language that you use when you're talking about, not somebody who sometimes might, and is capable of, but who, in fact, will do so, to the best of his ability, assist the defendant. But sometimes the Court goes beyond what the facts are, and sometimes -- you know, sometimes it issues a holding that's just precisely calibrated to the facts, and sometimes broader. And -- and it seems that what we do is we look at the language, we look at what the Court said, and said given what the Court said, is this right clearly established. And I guess, again, just to repeat what Justice Ginsburg said, I started counting up the word ""assist"" in this opinion and, frankly, I lost track. That every time this opinion talks about this, it talks about assisting the defense and assisting the defendant, including to cross-examine the prosecution. It just seems that the premise of the entire opinion is you're on the defense team. Well, at first it does, you're exactly right. And this is why I asked about Baldi. I find those two paragraphs incredibly confusing, because the first paragraph says, we're distinguishing it because there it was a neutral expert. And then the second paragraph says, anyhow, Baldi -- I mean, it does -- it doesn't use the term overall, but a lower court would be crazed if it relied on Baldi after that opinion. No, no, no. Two paragraphs might be confusing, but the question is, what does the opinion say, and particularly, what does the holding say? But again, General, I mean, the actual holding of Ake calls for assistance in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense. And the theme of Ake, if you will, is all about how we used to think that psychiatric opinions were just like one thing, but now we know better. We know that different psychiatrists have different opinions, and it's really important to arm even an indigent defendant with the tools that he needs to come back at the State and to say -- and to say -- and to establish what he wants to establish about his mental health. I mean, that's really the theme of the opinion, that you have to give the indigent defendants, just as you give the wealthier defendant, the tools that they need to establish what they want to establish about mental health. And then that's consistent with the -- with these words that are repeated in the holding and elsewhere. No, no, no. And it's not taking about parity. All it's saying is that we recognize that the State is going to have experts, we recognize that if you had money you would have experts, we recognize that mental health is one of those things that people can have different opinions about, and that people would really like to have experts. And we're going to give this indigent person a single one who will be able to assist him in these ways, in evaluating, preparing, and presenting the defense. General, that just has to be wrong as a statement of how we figure out what clearly established is. We don't look at the facts in the QP, we look at the holding. This is what the holding says. You're entitled to somebody who will assist you in evaluating, preparing, and presenting your defense. That would be quite something, I have to say, General. If we say: Listen, when you read our opinions and when you try to figure out what we're saying, what you have to do is go back to the QP and just narrow it to exactly what the QP said. I think that that would be a shocking way to interpret this Court's opinions. ",mr bright even the terminology that you be use both here and in your brief contain some ambiguity because you keep say well ake establish the right to an independent expert but independent can mean really the defense expert or independent can mean independent of both the prosecutor and the defense and what you be say that ake hold be that it be a defense expert but and there be certainly part of the opinion that read like that there be no question that when ake talk about assistance over and over again it read like a defense expert but the question be do ake really preclude the idea of a completely independent person independent of both the state and the defense mr bright can i ask you for your interpretation of there be two paragraph on page which talk about smith v baldi which be a case where there be in fact a neutral expert and and and the court talk about why it do not have to pay attention to smith v baldi I be just curious as to what your interpretation of these paragraph be because well I will just leave it like that sorry general but if we could just focus on because i think it would help to just sort of let us assume for the moment that this defendant do not get what he be ask for which be a defense expert and say whether ake entitle him to such an expert and i just want to sort of focus on the money sentence in ake you know what the we therefore hold sentence and it say here s what we hold we hold that when the defendant make this preliminary showing that mental health be go to be at issue the state must assure the defendant access to a competent psychiatrist who will assist in evaluation preparation and presentation of the defense so assist in evaluation preparation and presentation of the defense and you know recognize that we be all smart people and we can read any word we can have an argument that any word mean anything we say still assist in evaluation preparation and presentation of the defense do not that mean like you know that be what you that be the phrase you would use for a counsel to assist in evaluation preparation and presentation of the defense it mean somebody on the defendant s side well they be capable in the sense that sometimes they might but it be not what you would this be i i guess I be repeat myself but this be the language that you use when you be talk about not somebody who sometimes might and be capable of but who in fact will do so to the best of his ability assist the defendant but sometimes the court go beyond what the fact be and sometimes you know sometimes it issue a hold that be just precisely calibrate to the fact and sometimes broad and and it seem that what we do be we look at the language we look at what the court say and say give what the court say be this right clearly establish and i guess again just to repeat what justice ginsburg say i start count up the word assist in this opinion and frankly i lose track that every time this opinion talk about this it talk about assist the defense and assist the defendant include to cross examine the prosecution it just seem that the premise of the entire opinion be you be on the defense team well at first it do you be exactly right and this be why i ask about baldi i find those two paragraph incredibly confuse because the first paragraph say we be distinguish it because there it be a neutral expert and then the second paragraph say anyhow baldi i mean it do it do not use the term overall but a low court would be craze if it rely on baldi after that opinion no no no two paragraph might be confuse but the question be what do the opinion say and particularly what do the hold say but again general i mean the actual holding of ake call for assistance in evaluation preparation and presentation of the defense and the theme of ake if you will be all about how we use to think that psychiatric opinion we be just like one thing but now we know well we know that different psychiatrist have different opinion and it be really important to arm even an indigent defendant with the tool that he need to come back at the state and to say and to say and to establish what he want to establish about his mental health i mean that be really the theme of the opinion that you have to give the indigent defendant just as you give the wealthy defendant the tool that they need to establish what they want to establish about mental health and then that be consistent with the with these word that be repeat in the holding and elsewhere no no no and it be not take about parity all it be say be that we recognize that the state be go to have expert we recognize that if you have money you would have expert we recognize that mental health be one of those thing that people can have different opinion about and that people would really like to have expert and we be go to give this indigent person a single one who will be able to assist him in these way in evaluate preparing and present the defense general that just have to be wrong as a statement of how we figure out what clearly establish be we do not look at the fact in the qp we look at the hold this be what the hold say you be entitle to somebody who will assist you in evaluate preparing and present your defense that would be quite something i have to say general if we say listen when you read our opinion and when you try to figure out what we be say what you have to do be go back to the qp and just narrow it to exactly what the qp say i think that that would be a shocking way to interpret this court s opinion ,381.24,Roberts Court,"Apr 24, 2017",James E.

2016,Honeycutt v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"But doesn't it seem that there's some back and forth about what's new and what's old in the government's theory, is that part of what's changed in the government's theory or not? This is a -- a bit off topic, but the statute refers to proceeds that the person obtained directly or indirectly. Do you have a view as to what that ""indirectly"" is doing there and what it encompasses? So do you have to show one of these five preconditions in (p)? So in other words you're saying, the defendant in (p) is the same as the person in A and both includes co-conspirators as well as the actual defendant or person? Mr. Fletcher, can I just ask you -- and I'm sorry, I'm sure it's -- I'm just not understanding it, but if I could just ask you to go through the mechanics of this. So there are two co-conspirators. They come away with one bag of money. Conspirator A takes it, but you have Conspirator B before you. He has not taken the money. Now, do you first have to show that Conspirator A's money because -- is that -- do you have to show that it's unavailable? Do you have to show that Conspirator A has dissipated it or do you not have to show that? In that proceeding. If they -- if you could go after Conspirator A, you could find it, he just put it in a bank account, but that's irrelevant. So really you're only saying it has to be unavailable as to Conspirator B. You do not have to prove that it's unavailable as to Conspirator A. You could know that it's in Conspirator A's bank account, it doesn't matter. As long as you can't get it through Conspirator B, you can go after B for -- for substitute assets. Okay. So then let's -- let's leave that to -- let's bracket that. Then as to B, who you do have in front of you, you started by talking a little bit about this -- this (p) section. Do you have to prove that one of these five preconditions in (p) is satisfied? Okay. I'm curious about that, but first let's talk about (b) -- (p). And have -- have you shown that in this case? Which one? And when you say that you've shown that, what do you mean? Mr. Fletcher, if I could, I'm awfully sorry -- -- but let's just take the -- the -- the case where there are these two conspirators and one takes the cash and it's in his basement. But the other one is the one before you, right? And let's put aside the extrastatutory money judgments, since I don't understand really how that works, so let's just focus on (p) All right? Now, do you -- you said you don't have to -- you don't have to show that it's really unavailable. You just have to show that it's unavailable as to the conspirator before you. Yeah. And then how do you show that these (p) conditions have been met as to that particular person? In other words, he never had the proceeds, so which acts could he have taken that dissipate the proceeds under (p)? But there is nothing -- But you just said that the other conspirator might not have dissipated them at all. They're sitting in his basement. And even though you can't show that -- this is why I keep on coming back to the preconditions of (p) You really can't show a particular act or omission that led to the dissipation of the assets in these particular five ways. Well, what if the dissipation was in furtherance of the conspiracy? Put the -- the cases that you're talking about aside. ",but do not it seem that there be some back and forth about what be new and what be old in the government s theory be that part of what be change in the government s theory or not this be a a bit off topic but the statute refers to proceeds that the person obtain directly or indirectly do you have a view as to what that indirectly be do there and what it encompass so do you have to show one of these five precondition in p so in other word you be say the defendant in p be the same as the person in a and both include co conspirator as well as the actual defendant or person mr fletcher can i just ask you and I be sorry I be sure it be I be just not understand it but if i could just ask you to go through the mechanic of this so there be two co conspirator they come away with one bag of money conspirator a take it but you have conspirator b before you he have not take the money now do you first have to show that conspirator a s money because be that do you have to show that it be unavailable do you have to show that conspirator a have dissipate it or do you not have to show that in that proceeding if they if you could go after conspirator a you could find it he just put it in a bank account but that be irrelevant so really you be only say it have to be unavailable as to conspirator b you do not have to prove that it be unavailable as to conspirator a you could know that it be in conspirator a s bank account it do not matter as long as you can not get it through conspirator b you can go after b for for substitute asset okay so then let us let us leave that to let us bracket that then as to b who you do have in front of you you start by talk a little bit about this this p section do you have to prove that one of these five precondition in p be satisfy okay I be curious about that but first let us talk about b p and have have you show that in this case which one and when you say that you have show that what do you mean mr fletcher if i could I be awfully sorry but let us just take the the the case where there be these two conspirator and one take the cash and it be in his basement but the other one be the one before you right and let us put aside the extrastatutory money judgment since i do not understand really how that work so let us just focus on p all right now do you you say you do not have to you do not have to show that it be really unavailable you just have to show that it be unavailable as to the conspirator before you yeah and then how do you show that these p condition have be meet as to that particular person in other word he never have the proceeds so which act could he have take that dissipate the proceeds under p but there be nothing but you just say that the other conspirator might not have dissipate them at all they be sit in his basement and even though you can not show that this be why i keep on come back to the precondition of p you really can not show a particular act or omission that lead to the dissipation of the asset in these particular five way well what if the dissipation be in furtherance of the conspiracy put the the case that you be talk about aside ,197.26,Roberts Court,"Mar 29, 2017",Terry Michael Honeycutt,United States,16-142,"Dec 9, 2016","Jun 5, 2017",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

2016,Bethune-Hill v. Virginia Board of Elections,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Elias, could I make sure I understand: What's your view of -- let's -- let's -- the policy here says 55 percent, and it says that across the board as to each of these 12 districts, and it says, effectively, this is the most important criteria, in the sense that it will trump other things. All right? So -- but -- but as I understand your argument, you're not resting your case on that fact alone; is that correct? And why is that? When would such -- when would such a policy not have the requisite impact on a voting district? So we really are looking to what Justice Breyer suggested, which is, we're -- we're looking to the movement of voters in and out of a particular district? Even -- even if we concede that there were -- you know, essentially, all the African-Americans were moved in and all the -- the -- the whites were moved out. It's -- Just if I -- so I can understand your sense of the relative strengths of your arguments, if we did remand, say, this is the wrong standard, go apply the right standard, and -- and that was done fairly, where do you think he would have to change his view, where do you think that there would be a question, and where do you think the same result would probably obtain? I thought she won by only, like, 1 1/2 percentage points in the general. Which you're saying, essentially, is idiosyncratic. So are those -- Are these the only kind of districts where you would say that a target would not have an impact on district lines? In other words, where the district has a population that's so far above the target that nothing that they're doing on the margins is affected by the target, are those the only kind? When, then, can you? What would be a case in which that might be possible? Not theoretically possible, but you can imagine it happening? May I ask, Mr. -- Mr. Gornstein, the -- the same question I asked Mr. Elias. If we did vacate this on the grounds that that's the correct standard, what you just said, and that is not the standard that the district court used, what do you think would happen? You know, if -- if the standard that you just stated was fairly applied, would anything change? But a strong case that it would change? And those districts are? I thought, Mr. Clement, that the -- the 55 percent was based on a single district, 75; and that they said, okay, we've looked at 75. You need 55 percent there. And then it was applied across the board to every other majority-minority district without any granular analysis. Isn't there something a bit strange about this kind of rule? And it's not to say that this kind of rule is the end all and be all. You -- it might be that you can have this rule and still be absolutely fine in the way that Mr. Gornstein suggested. But the idea that you would look at 12 districts and say that every single one of them ought to meet the same BVAP standard without looking at the characteristics of those districts, who's in them, how they vote, I mean, it just -- it sort of defies belief you could pick a number and say that applies with respect to every majority-minority district. But, Mr. Clement -- No, please. Just -- yeah, no, just going back to Justice Kennedy's question, it seems pretty clear to me that in the cases after Shaw -- because Shaw, you could have looked at it as, this is all about the way the district looks, and then in the cases after Shaw, in Shaw II, and in Miller, the Court makes very clear that it's not all about the way the district looks, and indeed -- If you look at Shaw and Shaw II and you look at Miller, and then you think about the -- the hypothetical that Justice Kennedy gave you, which is essentially -- maybe I'll change it a little bit -- it's essentially a mapmaker who says, look, we really want to do race-based districting here. We can manage to do this in a way where the maps look kind of contiguous and kind of regularly shaped, but what we're doing is race-based decision making. Now, it seems pretty clear to me that if you look at Shaw II, if you look at Miller, that's forbidden. And -- and -- and that's exactly the opposite of what the district court said here. Well, then I'm with Justice Breyer, who suggested that a few years ago we took those concerns into account and we tried to figure out a test that was responsive to those concerns, and that is not the test that the district court used here. You absolutely don't, Mr. Clement. But it's one thing for a legislature to say, we view it as a core priority up there with one-person, one-vote to comply with the Voting Rights Act. That's a terrific thing. It's another thing for the legislature to do what it did, for example, in the Alabama case, which is to just say something about there can't be any retrogression from whatever there is, notwithstanding that that's just not Section 5 law, and, similarly, it's another thing for the legislature to just pick a number out of one district, apply it to all 12 districts, and say that that's compliance with the Voting Rights Act. Now, I agree with you and with Mr. Elias and with Mr. Gornstein: That does not get you all the way there. But there's something about -- this is -- Alabama suggested this was evidence. When a State says across the board we're going to do something that just on its face you know is not required by the Voting Rights Act, that's a problem. I think the -- the real difference between your standard and the SG's standard is that in your standard, the shape of a district functions as a threshold inquiry such that if the shape is okay, we don't look at anything else, and particularly we don't look even if the districting was completely race-based in motive. And that's just what the -- that three-part test does. It sets up a threshold inquiry about -- about how the district is shaped in a way that some people thought Shaw was when Shaw was first announced and that this Court in one, two, three subsequent cases made clear it wasn't. Well, it's more than a theoretical possibility. And Mr. Gornstein says -- and he seems to be pretty sensitive to the idea of giving States latitude. But he looks at this and says, this standard actually did make a difference on the ground, that there were districts kicked out and said, oh, this isn't race-based because it looks good, even though it was race-based. ",mr elia could i make sure i understand what be your view of let us let us the policy here say percent and it say that across the board as to each of these district and it say effectively this be the most important criterion in the sense that it will trump other thing all right so but but as i understand your argument you be not rest your case on that fact alone be that correct and why be that when would such when would such a policy not have the requisite impact on a voting district so we really be look to what justice breyer suggest which be we be we be look to the movement of voter in

understand your sense of the relative strength of your argument if we do remand say this be the wrong standard go apply the right standard and and that be do fairly where do you think he would have to change his view where do you think that there would be a question and where do you think the same result would probably obtain i think she win by only like percentage point in the general which you be say essentially be idiosyncratic so be those be these the only kind of district where you would say that a target would not have an impact on district line in other word where the district have a population that be so far above the target that nothing that they be do on the margin be affect by the target be those the only kind when then can you what would be a case in which that might be possible not theoretically possible but you can imagine it happen may i ask mr mr gornstein the the same question i ask mr elia if we do vacate this on the ground that that be the correct standard what you just say and that be not the standard that the district court use what do you think would happen you know if if the standard that you just state be fairly apply would anything change but a strong case that it would change and those district be i think mr clement that the the percent be base on a single district and that they say okay we have look at you need percent there and then it be apply across the board to every other majority minority district without any granular analysis be not there something a bit strange about this kind of rule and it be not to say that this kind of rule

case after shaw because shaw you could have look at it as this be all about the way the district look and then in the case after shaw in shaw ii and in miller the court make very clear that it be not

2016,Expressions Hair Design v. Schneiderman,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Gupta, what -- what speech precisely do you think is being restricted? Well, I guess that's why I said like what speech precisely, and you said the message that you're going to pay more if you use a credit card. But, you know, as -- this -- this statute is not written in terms of speech, it's -- it's written in terms of imposing a surcharge. And -- and let's say that somebody -- let's say that there is a merchant and the merchant charges the list price for something as a dollar and the person comes up to the cash register and offers a dollar bill. And -- and the cashier says, oh, no. For you it's 95 cents because I impose a surcharge for people who use credit cards; right? Now, would that violate this law? You don't know? How would it violate the law? You don't think it would. Even though you're describing something as a surcharge. Because -- the reason it wouldn't violate the law is because the conduct is, you know -- it -- it fits the law, right, that essentially you're not imposing a surcharge on credit card users. Whatever you call it, however you describe it, you're not imposing a surcharge on credit card users. See, that's what you keep -- you -- you said that again -- -- and I think my hypothetical was designed to show that that's just not right. I mean, I can imagine ways in which you might say that this is restricting speech, but that's not it. Because as long as the price listed is the higher price, is the price that a credit card company has to pay, as long as that's true, you can describe it any which way you please. And you can describe it in terms of impose -- of -- of imposing a surcharge or charging credit card customers more, and it still is not going to violate this law. Mr. Gupta, this exchange -- I mean, I think that these are two very different theories of what makes this a speech restriction. And I guess the reason I asked my question was because Justice Alito's theory does not appear to be your theory, and I want to know which theory we're really talking about here. Justice Alito's theory is that when the legislation says you have to post the higher price, that that in itself is a restriction on speech. And that's an interesting argument, and maybe he's right about that. I don't know. Now, your brief took a different position. Your brief essentially said the problem is that this -- this -- this legislation affects the way a cashier or somebody in a store -- just affects -- it affects the way they describe transactions generally, you know, and the cashier is going to be worried that she can't say to the customer, you charge more if you use a credit card. And I guess I wanted to know, which theory is your theory? The latter one. Mr. Gupta, you're putting really a lot of emphasis on a few cases in which prosecutors describe the law in a certain way. But the law as written doesn't really do any of the things that you're saying. I mean, Justice Alito is right. The law as written actually can be read -- and Justice Sotomayor said this before -- as just requiring a single price. Now, that's something that none of the parties here say, but if you just look at the law, that's what the law says. Let's take that out of the picture. Even then the law can say, the only thing that we are requiring is that you list the higher price. That's the only thing that we are requiring. And then you can describe what you're doing any way you like. You can use the word ""surcharge."" You can use the word ""more."" You can use the word ""less."" You can use the word ""discount."" It doesn't matter. So long as you list the higher price, you're in the clear. And that, too, is very different from what you're saying, maybe from what the prosecutor said. But just the way you read this law, it just doesn't give -- I mean, what these prosecutors say don't match what the law says. The law says, you know, this is all about listing, you know, conduct; what you can charge. Well, New York is saying in its brief that that's not the case; that you can say what you want to say; that you can call this a surcharge; that you can communicate in the way you want to communicate as long as your listed price is the -- is the credit card price. I'm sorry. You said something very interesting. You said if you take the statute, if you understand the statute to just mean that the listed price has to be the credit card price, that looks like a disclosure regime. Could you explain that? And -- and your understanding of why it is a speech regulation, it -- is because it affects the way you list prices; is that right? Well, isn't the idea, Mr. Feigin, that if you said 32.46 plus 2 percent, then you really are requiring people to do some work and you'd rather just have them know that it's -- see, I can't do it that fast. (Laughter.) Could I -- I feel it -- I'm sorry. Can I ask you a different question? It -- it does -- this does not look like a disclosure requirement. It just -- I mean, one way to understand this is exactly what you said. It -- it requires disclosure. Whether everybody needs that disclosure, whether only a few people need that disclosure in the $10.20 case, but it requires disclosure to make sure that everybody is on the same page in terms of knowing prices. But if you look at the language of the statute, it just doesn't look like that. And -- and if we're going to say that something is a disclosure requirement and so subject to a lesser forum of First Amendment review, shouldn't the State be making clear that that's what this is? But, you know, there does seem to have been a debate about what this statute means. Because I look at some of this enforcement history and I think -- I don't really understand why this violates that law. And, in fact, you've walked away from some of that enforcement history in your briefing and said, look, the cashier can call it whatever she wants to call it as long as the listed price is the credit card price. But that is contradicting some of this enforcement history where a different understanding of this law was used. So how do we deal with that? I mean, here's the narrow way in which this seems to affect communication, speech. I'm a seller. I set my prices. I say I want to charge cash customers a dollar and I want to charge credit card customers $1.05. All right? Now, if I put my list price as $1.05 and then the cash customers get a happy surprise, that seems fine. But if I put my list price as a dollar and then the credit card companies get a not-so-happy surprise, that can't be done. So it does affect the way a seller communicates which price he's going to say is the regular price, is the list price. So why isn't that a speech regulation? Now, you might say, as the solicitor general does, it is a speech regulation, but it's only a disclosure regulation and subject to a lower standard. But you're saying it's not a speech regulation at all. And I want to know why, given that it is affecting which price you choose to say is your list price. Mr. Wu, you think, is this not true, that the dual pricing scheme is legal; is that right? That was something that the Second Circuit did not decide, said it was abstaining on. It seems to me that that's quite relevant to this question of whether this is a disclosure requirement. Because if the dual pricing scheme is not legal, it is really hard to characterize this as a disclosure requirement. Would you agree with that? ",mr gupta what what speech precisely do you think be be restrict well i guess that be why i say like what speech precisely and you say the message that you be go to pay more if you use a credit card but you know as this this statute be not write in term of speech it be it be write in term of impose a surcharge and and let us say that somebody let us say that there be a merchant and the merchant charge the list price for something as a dollar and the person come up to the cash register and offer a dollar bill and and the cashier say oh no for you it be cent because i impose a surcharge for people who use credit card right now would that violate this law you do not know how would it violate the law you do not think it would even though you be describe something as a surcharge because the reason it would not violate the law be because the conduct be you know it it fit the law right that essentially you be not impose a surcharge on credit card user whatever you call it however you describe it you be not impose a surcharge on credit card user see that be what you keep you you say that again and i think my hypothetical be design to show that that be just not right i mean i can imagine way in which you might say that this be restrict speech but that be not it because as long as the price list be the high price be the price that a credit card company have to pay as long as that be true you can describe it any which way you please and you can describe it in term of impose of of impose a surcharge or charge credit card customer more and it still be not go to violate this law mr gupta this exchange i mean i think that these be two very different theory of what make this a speech restriction and i guess the reason i ask my question be because justice alito s theory do not appear to be your theory and i want to know which theory we be really talk about here justice alito s theory be that when the legislation say you have to post the high price that that in itself be a restriction on speech and that be an interesting argument and maybe he be right about that i do not know now your brief take a different position your brief essentially say the problem be that this this this legislation affect the way a cashier or somebody in a store just affect it affect the way they describe transaction generally you know and the cashier be go to be worry that she can not say to the customer you charge more if you use a credit card and i guess i want to know which theory be your theory the latter one mr gupta you be put really a lot of emphasis on a few case in which prosecutor describe the law in a certain way but the law as write do not really do any of the thing that you be say i mean justice alito be right the law as write actually can be read and justice sotomayor say this before as just require a single price now that be something that none of the party here say but if you just look at the law that be what the law say let us take that out of the picture even then the law can say the only thing that we be require be that you list the high price that be the only thing that we be require and then you can describe what you be do any way you like you can use the word surcharge you can use the word more you can use the word less you can use the word discount it do not matter so long as you list the high price you be in the clear and that too be very different from what you be say maybe from what the prosecutor say but just the way you read this law it just do not give i mean what these prosecutor say do not match what the law say the law say you know this be all about listing you know conduct what you can charge well new york be say in its brief that that be not the case that you can say what you want to say that you can call this a surcharge that you can communicate in the way you want to communicate as long as your listed price be the be the credit card price I be sorry you say something very interesting you say if you take the statute if you understand the statute to just mean that the list price have to be the credit card price that look like a disclosure regime could you explain that and and your understanding of why it be a speech regulation it be because it affect the way you list price be that right well be not the idea mr feigin that if you say plus percent then you really be require people to do some work and you would rather just have them know that it be see i can not do it that fast laughter could i i feel it I be sorry can i ask you a different question it it do this do not look like a disclosure requirement it just i mean one way to understand this be exactly what you say it it require disclosure whether everybody need that disclosure whether only a few people need that disclosure in the case but it require disclosure to make sure that everybody be on the same page in term of know price but if you look at the language of the statute it just do not look like that and and if we be go to say that something be a disclosure requirement and so subject to a less forum of first amendment review should not the state be make clear that that be what this be but you know there do seem to have be a debate about what this statute mean because i look at some of this enforcement history and i think i do not really understand why this violate that law and in fact you have walk away from some of that enforcement history in your briefing and say look the cashier can call it whatever she want to call it as long as the listed price be the credit card price but that be contradict some of this enforcement history where a different understanding of this law be use so how do we deal with that i mean here s the narrow way in which this seem to affect communication speech I be a seller i set my price i say i want to charge cash customer a dollar and i want to charge credit card customer all right now if i put my list price as and then the cash customer get a happy surprise that seem fine but if i put my list price as a dollar and then the credit card company get a not so happy surprise that can not be do so it do affect the way a seller communicate which price he be go to say be the regular price be the list price so why be not that a speech regulation now you might say as the solicitor general do it be a speech regulation but it be only a disclosure regulation and subject to a low standard but you be say it be not a speech regulation at all and i want to know why give that it be affect which price you choose to say be your list price mr wu you think be this not true that the dual pricing scheme be legal be that right that be something that the second circuit do not decide say it be abstain on it seem to me that that be quite relevant to this question of whether this be a disclosure requirement because if the dual pricing scheme be not legal it be really hard to characterize this as a disclosure requirement would you agree with that ,475.44000000000005,Roberts

2016,Fry v. Napoleon Community Schools,114,Elena Kagan,"Could -- could I ask about that, Mr. Bagenstos? And this takes you back to the first part of the Chief Justice's question, just so I can understand the argument, is you're really making two arguments. One argument is initially when we filed the complaint and ever since, we've really only sought emotional distress damages, and emotional distress damages are something that can't be given under the. And that's one argument. But there is a second argument which says, you know, putting that aside, the reason why we don't need to exhaust is because we are not alleging that we've been denied a fair and appropriate public education. You know, we are alleging some other denial or -- or deprivation, but we are not alleging that. We agree that the school has given us a free appropriate public education. And that, in itself, as I understand it, would also mean that you don't have to exhaust, right? So it can be one or the other. Is that what you're saying. Now, this -- this case is actually the combination of the two, is what you're saying. So in some ways, you're saying this is the easiest case where both are true. You're neither alleging the denial of a FAPE, nor are you seeking the kinds of damages that an IDEA officer could provide. So it's the intersection of the two theories. But -- but if I understand your argument, either one of those things would mean that you don't have to exhaust. Is that right? But you might be. I mean, and this goes to -- I mean, suppose -- suppose that you weren't alleging a denial of a FAPE, but you were seeking damages that included, you know, I sent my kid to private school. I had to hire a tutor. Damages that you could get from an IDEA officer, but for some reason that didn't have to do with the denial of a FAPE. You're saying that you don't have to exhaust in that context either. And I suppose one understanding of this is we don't have to really deal with what happens if you only have one, because you're saying you have both. Is that right? What if you had a complaint where the parties did concede that IDEA was not violated, that a FAPE had been provided, but as you looked in the allegations in the complaint, it really seems that there is grounds to think that a FAPE was not provided and that the IDEA was violated? What do you do with a complaint that looks like that? But the declaration was that the ADA had been violated. Well, it's not available; you don't get a declaration that the ADA has been violated or the Rehabilitation Act has been violated from IDEA officer. Well, Mr. Katyal, think of it this way: Suppose this girl wanted to go into a public library a couple of times a week and the library said, you can't take your dog here; we're going to just provide you with a librarian who will help you do all the things that your dog otherwise helps you with, and the girl brings a suit. Isn't that suit exactly the suit that she brought, except that instead of a library, it's a school? But that's her -- that's her claim and those are her damages, that she was deprived of access to a public facility in a way that caused her distress and emotional harm. But this goes back to Justice Ginsburg's point. I mean, the entire point of the statute and the overruling of our prior case was Congress saying the fact that the IDEA exists for schools does not mean that you don't have separate ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims. And if you bring those separate kind of claims, which are essentially denial of access claims to public facilities, and then you're asking in addition to that for a form of damages that has nothing to do with what any IDEA officer can provide, then you can go forward without exhaustion. But the Plaintiffs here are not suggesting that the IEP was deficient. They are saying the IEP was perfectly efficient. If all you look at are the kinds of educational criteria that IEPs usually look at, then the dog isn't necessary. What the dog is necessary for is things that don't have anything to do with the IEP, is what the plaintiffs say. And after all, that's what they are saying, and that's what they are seeking. And that's what this statute suggests that we ought to look to. I don't understand that, Mr. Katyal. I mean, you yourself have an example in your brief of abuse towards a handicapped disabled student that would result in money damages and maybe emotional distress, but maybe also the parents took the kid out of school and -- and is asking for the school to -- the private school tuition that they had to incur, so all kinds of things. But it was -- it was -- it was not because of anything that the IEP said or didn't say. It was because there was discrimination on the basis of disability. Now, it was in a school, and it could be remedied by school-type things, like stop discriminating or abusing against a disabled student. But even you in your briefs say that doesn't have anything to do with the IDEA. And so why isn't this the same thing? I don't -- discrete instance. How about if you had a continuing stream of abuse? The IDEA doesn't care about particular instances but cares about -- But, Mr. Katyal, are you suggesting that there is no such thing as continuing discrimination that happens in a school setting that actually does not have anything to do with the IEP? But as I understand it from one of Amicus briefs, just to sort of put a fine point on this. There are close to a million students who are disabled in some way but who do not get an IEP. So if there is discrimination or if there is a failure to provide access to one of those students you don't have to exhaust the IDEA procedure, do you? I'm not sure I understood the answer to the question. In that case, you would not send the -- the -- the child to the IDEA officer, would you? 700,000, if I can read what the -- ",could could i ask about that mr bagenstos and this take you back to the first part of the chief justice s question just so i can understand the argument be you be really make two argument one argument be initially when we file the complaint and ever since we have really only sought emotional distress damage and emotional distress damage be something that can not be give under the and that be one argument but there be a second argument which say you know put that aside the reason why we do not need to exhaust be because we be not allege that we have be deny a fair and appropriate public education you know we be allege some other denial or or deprivation but we be not allege that we agree that the school have give us a free appropriate public education and that in itself as i understand it would also mean that you do not have to exhaust right so it can be one or the other be that what you be say now this this case be actually the combination of the two be what you be say so in some way you be say this be the easy case where both be true you be neither allege the denial of a fape nor be you seek the kind of damage that an idea officer could provide so it be the intersection of the two theory but but if i understand your argument either one of those thing would mean that you do not have to exhaust be that right but you might be i mean and this go to i mean suppose suppose that you be not allege a denial of a fape but you we be seek damage that include you know i send my kid to private school i have to hire a tutor damage that you could get from an idea officer but for some reason that do not have to do with the denial of a fape you be say that you do not have to exhaust in that context either and i suppose one understanding of this be we do not have to really deal with what happen if you only have one because you be say you have both be that right what if you have a complaint where the party do concede that idea be not violate that a fape have be provide but as you look in the allegation in the complaint it really seem that there be ground to think that a fape be not provide and that the idea be violate what do you do with a complaint that look like that but the declaration be that the ada have be violate well it have not available you do not get a declaration that the ada have be violate or the rehabilitation act have be violate from idea officer well mr katyal think of it this way suppose this girl want to go into a public library a couple of time a week and the library say you can not take your dog here we be go to just provide you with a librarian who will help you do all the thing that your dog otherwise help you with and the girl bring a suit be not that suit exactly the suit that she bring except that instead of a library it be a school but that be her that be her claim and those be her damage that she be deprive of access to a public facility in a way that cause her distress and emotional harm but this go back to justice ginsburg s point i mean the entire point of the statute and the overruling of

essentially denial of access claim to public facility and then you be ask in addition to that for a form of damage that have nothing to do with what any idea officer can provide then you can go forward without exhaustion but the plaintiff here be not suggest that the iep be deficient they be say the iep be perfectly efficient if all you look at be the kind of educational criterion that ieps usually look at then the dog be not necessary what the dog be necessary for be thing that do not have anything to do with the iep be what the plaintiff say and after all that be what they be say and that be what they be seek and that be what this statute suggest that we ought to look to i do not understand that mr katyal i mean you yourself have an example in your brief of abuse towards a

2016,Midland Funding v. Johnson,114,Elena Kagan,"Before you get to that language, Mr. Shanmugam. Could you just -- you know, just from a commonsense basis, it seems hard to understand why Congress would want all these unenforceable proofs of claim to flow in, because only two things can happen. One is that the trustee will properly filter out those claims; and the other is that the trustee will be swamped and won't have the time or the energy or the inclination or he'll make mistakes, and some of those claims will be deemed enforceable when, in fact, they're not. So why would anybody want these proofs of claim to flood into the bankruptcy system? But I -- but I -- the understanding here is that this case involves not claims which maybe they're barred by the statute of limitations and maybe they're not, but the issue, as presented to us, is as to claims where everybody knows, including the person who's filing the proof of claim, that they're barred by the statute of limitations. And what sense could it make for Congress to think, oh, that's a great idea for some -- for people just to file those claims and -- and, you know, the -- on the -- on -- the best thing that can happen is that those claims will be filtered out, and the worst thing that can happen is that they won't be. People will make mistakes and people will pay on things that they shouldn't be paying on. Well, Mr. -- I'm sorry. Let's suppose that you are right, that the Code allows this. I mean, it's hard for me to believe that the Code actively invites it, but let's suppose, as it's written, allows that. So then you wouldn't violate the Code by filing these proofs of claim. That's -- that's for sure. But why would that also absolve you from liability under other statutes? The codes does not obligate this. You don't have to do this under the Code. It's a choice. And then another statute can come along and say, you know what, for certain actors, for certain creditors, for these debt collectors, there's an independent rule and the Code says nothing about that. So what are the other affirmative defenses that your argument might apply to? Are there any affirmative defenses that your argument might apply to that are bankruptcy-related particularly? Or are these all kind of the sort of defenses that are involved in any suit? Right. I was asking, are any of those defenses only bankruptcy related? Do some of them only arise in a bankruptcy proceeding? Is your argument -- -- dependent on a view of the code that precludes these kinds of claims? So if -- if one looked at the code and said, well, it seems as though these kinds of claims, although unenforceable, can be filed, if that was your view of the code, what do you think follows from that? ",before you get to that language mr shanmugam could you just you know just from a commonsense basis it seem hard to understand why congress would want all these unenforceable proof of claim to flow in because only two thing can happen one be that the trustee will properly filter out those claim and the other be that the trustee will be swamp and will not have the time or the energy or the inclination or he will make mistake and some of those claim will be deem enforceable when in fact they be not so why would anybody want these proof of claim to flood into the bankruptcy system but i but i the understanding here be that this case involve not claim which maybe they be bar by the statute of limitation and maybe they be not but the issue as present to us be as to claim where everybody know include the person who be file the proof of claim that they be bar by the statute of limitation and what sense could it make for congress to think oh that be a great idea for some for people just to file those claim and and you know the on the on the best thing that can happen be that those claim will be filter out and the bad thing that can happen be that they will not be people will make mistake and people will pay on thing that they should not be pay on well mr I be sorry let us suppose that you be right that the code allow this i mean it be hard for me to believe that the code actively invite it but let us suppose as it be write allow that so then you would not violate the code by file these proof of claim that be that be for sure but why would that also absolve you from liability under other statute the code do not obligate this you do not have to do this under the code it be a choice and then another statute can come along and say you know what for certain actor for certain creditor for these debt collector there be an independent rule and the code say nothing about that so what be the other affirmative defense that your argument might apply to be there any affirmative defense that your argument might apply to that be bankruptcy relate particularly or be these all kind of the sort of defense that be involve in any suit right i be ask be any of those defense only bankruptcy relate do some of them only arise in a bankruptcy proceeding be your argument dependent on a view of the code that preclude these kind of claim so if if one look at the code and say well it seem as though these kind of claim although unenforceable can be file if that be your view of the code what do you think follow from that ,156.49999999999997,Roberts Court,"Jan 17, 2017","Midland Funding, LLC",Aleida Johnson,16-348,"Oct 11, 2016","May 15, 2017",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2016,Lee v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"I would have thought that the -- that -- that the difference is more fundamental, which is that usually in Strickland, we are asking what was going to happen at trial. And we don't think, well, there was this 1 percent chance that the witness would drop dead. We put that to the side. But here, the inquiry is different. The inquiry is not the outcome of the trial. The inquiry is the outcome of the plea proceeding. And the plea proceeding might be very affected by somebody saying, you know, given my ties to this country, given my negative ties to any other country, given the fact that this is only a nine-month difference in prison term, I'm going to roll the dice for that 1 percent chance. And that would be a completely reasonable thing to do, a thing that many people would do. But the key is that the outcome of the proceeding here is not the outcome of the trial, as it usually is in a Strickland case. The outcome of the proceeding here is the outcome of the plea negotiation. And that is the Hill test, right? We've said that. I mean, this is not your test. This is a test that's staring at me on page 59 of volume 474. You see -- -- that's confusing two things. And this goes back to the point that the Chief Justice made, is that you keep on saying what's the probability that the jury wouldn't have convicted him, but that's not the question, and we made this clear in Hill and in other cases. The question is: What's the -- what's the -- what's the probability that the relevant proceeding would have been different? And here the relevant proceeding is the plea negotiation and the plea agreement. And that's the thing that we're looking at is did this deficient performance lead to a different decision by this -- by Mr. Lee to go to trial or not, to plea or not. And that's all we're supposed to be looking at here, according to Hill. Now, that has its difficulties, as Justice Alito said. What exactly do we look to? How do we draw lines? There's no question that this is, in some cases, an uncomfortable inquiry. But that's the inquiry we're supposed to be making, isn't it? And you keep flipping it to a different inquiry, which is the inquiry in a trial context, but not in a plea context. This is what -- this is what Hill says, Mr. Feigin. It just says, here's the standard: The defendant must show that there's a reasonable probability that but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial. That's what we're trying to determine, whether he would have insisted on going to trial. So to the contrary, when Hill keeps on going, it says, you know, this -- this defendant didn't care about his parole eligibility, so we shouldn't -- we shouldn't look at the fact that the -- the parole eligibility was a bad deal for him because he didn't care. So the emphasis clearly in Hill is -- is what are the things that would have made a difference -- -- in the plea negotiation? What Padilla is saying, isn't it, Mr. Feigin, is essentially, look, this is not going to be a case where somebody can just get up and say this is what I would have done and the court has to accept it. No, Padilla says. The court doesn't have to accept every claim that a defendant makes. A court can test those claims against a notion of rationality, against a notion of what reasonable people would do. But still, the -- the essence of the inquiry is what would -- what would have happened at the plea negotiation, not what would have happened at the trial. You don't mean that -- -- Mr. Feigin. I think -- You don't mean that. I think -- because I think what you just said was that there's no constitutional right to go to trial when there's no evidence? Of course -- -- there's a constitutional right to go to trial, isn't there? Even if there's -- even if there's very weak evidence on your side. Well -- Well, let me just -- -- finish the question. I mean, you would agree that there's a constitutional right to go to trial, regardless of what the -- -- regardless of what the state of the evidence was; right? Which is the question that Justice Sotomayor asked you. And she said, and why isn't this correct? So then the question is, has there been deficient performance? And a person's entitlement to go to trial and entitlement to stare at all the various probabilities and to make an informed choice, that entitlement has been taken away by the supremely deficient performance. And that should be the question. Strickland is a very different case in that -- in that way. Because what Strickland says is once you're at a trial, you're right is to a fair and accurate trial. And nullification has nothing to do with a fair and accurate trial. But this is before. This is when you're trying to decide whether to exercise that right to go to trial. And there, what you're entitled to is that a lawyer be able to give you, in a nondeficient way, the various circumstances, the various things that you would consider to enable you to make that constitutional -- constitutionally protected decision in a reasonable way. Well, all you're asking the judge to do is to say that in certain circumstances, it is not beyond the bounds of reasonableness to throw the dice in order to get an outcome -- in order to get -- in order not to be deported from a country where you've lived your whole life. But, Mr. Feigin, again the -- just in your words, objective reasonableness, why can't a judge find as to a defendant that it is objectively reasonable to give up six or eight or nine months for a shot at staying in this country rather than being deported to a place that you don't know and where you have no ties? I mean, you know, if somebody gave me that choice, sign me up. So I think of myself as an objectively reasonable human being. It's an objectively reasonable assessment, it's an -- it -- it would be an objectively reasonable choice to exercise my right to a jury trial in that context. And that's the question, whether it's objectively reasonable to make a decision different from the decision that I would have made in this proceeding, which is the plea negotiation. Well, the court can do it in the way that the Court has done it since 1985 when we said that this was the inquiry under Hill. This is what courts have been doing since -- for the last 30 years. It's what many courts have been doing for three decades. ",i would have think that the that that the difference be more fundamental which be that usually in strickland we be ask what be go to happen at trial and we do not think well there be this percent chance that the witness would drop dead we put that to the side but here the inquiry be different the inquiry be not the outcome of the trial the inquiry be the outcome of the plea proceeding and the plea proceeding might be very affect by somebody say you know give my tie to this country give my negative tie to any other country give the fact that this be only a nine month difference in prison term I be go to roll the dice for that percent chance and that would be a completely reasonable thing to do a thing that many people would do but the key be that the outcome of the proceeding here be not the outcome of the trial as it usually be in a strickland case the outcome of the proceeding here be the outcome of the plea negotiation and that be the hill test right we have say that i mean this be not your test this be a test that be star at me on page of volume you see that be confuse two thing and this go back to the point that the chief justice make be that you keep on say what be the probability that the jury would not have convict him but that be not the question and we make this clear in hill and in other case the question be what be the what be the what have the probability that the relevant proceeding would have be different and here the relevant proceeding be the plea negotiation and the plea agreement and that be the thing that we be look at be do this deficient performance lead to a different decision by this by mr lee to go to trial or not to plea or not and that be all we be suppose to be look at here accord to hill now that have its difficulty as justice alito say what exactly do we look to how do we draw line there be no question that this be in some case an uncomfortable inquiry but that be the inquiry we be suppose to be make be not it and you keep flip it to a different inquiry which be the inquiry in a trial context but not in a plea context this be what this be what hill say mr feigin it just say here s the standard the defendant must show that there be a reasonable probability that but for counsel s error he would not have plead guilty and would have insist on go to trial that be what we be try to determine whether he would have insist on go to trial so to the contrary when hill keep on go it say you know this this defendant do not care about his parole eligibility so we should not we should not look at the fact that the the parole eligibility be a bad deal for him because he do not care so the emphasis clearly in hill be be what be the thing that would have make a difference in the plea negotiation what padilla be say be not it mr feigin be essentially look this be not go to be a case where somebody can just get up and say this be what i would have do and the court have to accept it no padilla say the court do not have to accept every claim that a defendant make a court can test those claim against a notion of rationality against a notion of what reasonable people would do but still the the essence of the inquiry be what would what would have happen at the plea negotiation not what would have happen at the trial you do not mean that mr feigin i think you do not mean that i think because i think what you just say be that there be no constitutional right to go to trial when there be no evidence of course there be a constitutional right to go to trial be not there even if there be even if there be very weak evidence on your side well well let me just finish the question i mean you would agree that there be a constitutional right to go to trial regardless of what the regardless of what the state of the evidence be right which be the question that justice sotomayor ask you and she say and why be not this correct so then the question be have there be deficient performance and a person s entitlement to go to trial and entitlement to stare at all the various probability and to make an informed choice that entitlement have be take away by the supremely deficient performance and that should be the question strickland be a very different case in that in that way because what strickland say be once you be at a trial you be right be to a fair and accurate trial and nullification have nothing to do with a fair and accurate trial but this be before this be when you be try to decide whether to exercise that right to go to trial and there what you be entitle to be that a lawyer be able to give you in a nondeficient way the various circumstance the various thing that you would consider to enable you to make that constitutional constitutionally protect decision in a reasonable way well all you be ask the judge to do be to say that in certain circumstance it be not beyond the bound of reasonableness to throw the dice in order to get an outcome in order to get in order not to be deport from a country where you have live your whole life but mr feigin again the just in your word objective reasonableness why can not a judge find as to a defendant that it be objectively reasonable to give up

Well, one question I suppose might be whether that is in fact producing the disparity in -- in judgments. But even suppose you're right that it is, I mean, these are treaties. So the idea that, you know, we would be consistently interpreting a treaty differently from the entire rest of the world would seem to create problems for our treaty-making powers, for our -- our ability to conform with what our treaty partners expect.

2016,Hernandez v. Mesa,114,Elena Kagan,"So is that -- I was trying to figure out from your brief what exactly your rule is. So are all five of those necessary, in your view, for there to be a Bivens claim? Is anything else necessary? Is that exactly the rule that you want us to adopt? I mean -- I suppose the -- Mr. Hilliard, if -- I think you said what your rule is in a pretty clear way. You've said essentially it's a border area and the shot came from the United States. So that, I take it, is your rule. So it seems to me that the harder question is actually -- and this goes back to the Chief Justice's question -- why is that your rule? You know, what makes that confluence of factors different from everything else? Well, I guess you keep saying that, Mr. Hilliard, that there's a problem here, and I respect that. But there are problems -- there might be problems in other situations as well. There might be problems when U.S. officials go into a foreign nation's territory. So -- so that leaves me still uncertain why -- I mean, you're saying as a practical matter, this is where the incidents are. But is that all you have as to why this is your rule, why the border cases are different? May I ask about an anomaly created by your rule? I take it everybody agrees that if there were a Texas State trooper who was involved in the exact same conduct, that trooper, you -- you would not be able to sue that trooper. So why is it that Bivens, which is usually thought of as a more limited remedy than 1983, I mean, why should you have this situation where you can sue the Federal agent, but not the State agent? The dividing line isn't even marked on the ground; isn't that right? You can't tell on the ground where Mexico ends and the United States begins. I think the point that Justice Breyer is making is this does seem like a very -- you know, it's a sui generous kind of case. It's this liminal area. I don't want to -- I don't know whether to call it a no-man's land, but it's this liminal area, which is kind of neither one thing nor another thing. So maybe it's that both countries maintain it, maybe it's that -- it's sort of neither country. Whatever it is, it's something very different from most areas where we know exactly whose jurisdiction operates and how. Well, Mr. Ortega, you say ""ad hoc,"" but -- Well, Mr. Ortega, the rule is very defined. If the shot comes from U.S. territory and it hits somebody in the culvert, then there's a -- there's a -- there's an action. That's a very defined rule. There's nothing unclear about that. You can argue is that a good rule? Is that a bad rule? Is there a good reason behind that rule? But it's a very clear rule. You're quite right, Mr. Kneedler, but there is a difference between this case and I think -- I think all -- maybe all but one -- of these other cases, which is in all of these others, the Court has been able to point to some alternative remedy. It might not have been the complete relief that a plaintiff in a case wanted, but it was something. And there was an ability to say, Congress has given you some way to address the harm that you've suffered. And here, there really is nothing. I mean, there's the idea that you might prosecute this person criminally, but what does the family get from that? And anyway, you almost never do. So -- so here, there's just no remedy. And isn't that really quite different from all these other Bivens cases that you referred to? Well, we said that, but, you know, Stanley might be the only case on your side. And Stanley is a military case where there is like the ultimate special factor. So for the most part, every time we've said no Bivens, we've said because there's an alternative remedy. And here we can't say that. Mr. Kneedler, you -- Mr Kneedler: -- for private confirmations. -- you get the point. The point of it is that it's the heartland of Bivens for a law enforcement officer to use deadly force in violation of the Fourth Amendment. That's the heartland of Bivens. We don't have to make up anything new. We don't have to extend it. We don't have to create anything. That's just Bivens. Well, could you say -- let's talk about that. How is this fraught with foreign relations issues? Because Mexico would surely prefer that -- that its citizen have a Bivens remedy. So you seem to be using foreign relations as if sort of this touches some other country. But in the usual case, I think we've asked what's the interference? What's the disruption? So tell me what the interference or the disruption is. The problem we would create -- -- not just the fact that it has something to do with another country. I'm sure Mexico cared a lot about this. The question I'm asking is how does the presence of the Bivens remedy disrupt or interfere with the United States' ability to carry out its foreign policy? I'm sure it wouldn't have to be written that way. (Laughter.) If the. -- if the Border Patrol agent stood where he stood and took the shot he did, and the only difference was that the teenager in the culvert was an American citizen, is there a Bivens action? ",so be that i be try to figure out from your brief what exactly your rule be so be all five of those necessary in your view for there to be a bivens claim be anything else necessary be that exactly the rule that you want us to adopt i mean i suppose the mr hilliard if i think you say what your rule be in a pretty clear way you have say essentially it be a border area and the shot come from the united state so that i take it be your rule so it seem to me that the hard question be actually and this go back to the chief justice s question why be that your rule you know what make that confluence of factor different from everything else well i guess you keep say that mr hilliard that there be a problem here and i respect that but there be problem there might be problem in other situation as well there might be problem when us official go into a foreign nation s territory so so that leave me still uncertain why i mean you be say as a practical matter this be where the incident be but be that all you have as to why this be your rule why the border case be different may i ask about an anomaly create by your rule i take it everybody agree that if there we be a texas state trooper who be involve in the exact same conduct that trooper you you would not be able to sue that trooper so why be it that bivens which be usually think of as a more limited remedy than i mean why should you have this situation where you can sue the federal agent but not the state agent the dividing line be not even mark on the ground be not that right you can not tell on the ground where mexico end and the united state begin i think the point that justice breyer be make be this do seem like a very you know it be a sui generous kind of case it be this liminal area i do not want to i do not know whether to call it a no man s land but it be this liminal area which be kind of neither one thing nor another thing so maybe it be that both country maintain it maybe it be that it be sort of neither country whatever it be it be something very different from most area where we know exactly whose jurisdiction operate and how well mr ortega you say ad hoc but well mr ortega the rule be very defined if the shot come from us territory and it hit somebody in the culvert then there be a there be a there be an action that be a very defined rule there be nothing unclear about that you can argue be that a good rule be that a bad rule be there a good reason behind that rule but it be a very clear rule you be quite right mr kneedler but there be a difference between this case and i think i think all maybe all but one of these other case which be in all of these others the court have be able to point to some alternative remedy it might not have be the complete relief that a plaintiff in a case want but it be something and there be an ability to say congress have give you some way to address the harm that you have suffer and here there really be nothing i mean there be the idea that you might prosecute this person criminally but what do the family get from that and anyway you almost never do so so here there be just no remedy and be not that really quite different from all these other bivens case that you refer to well we say that but you know stanley might be the only case on your side and stanley be a military case where there be like the ultimate special factor so for the most part every time we have say no bivens we have say because there be an alternative remedy and here we can not say that mr kneedler you mr kneedler for private confirmation you get the point the point of it be that it be the heartland of bivens for a law enforcement officer to use deadly force in violation of the fourth amendment that be the heartland of bivens we do not have to make up anything new we do not have to extend it we do not have to create anything that be just bivens well could you say let us talk about that how be this fraught with foreign relation issue because mexico would surely prefer that that its citizen have a bivens remedy so you seem to be use foreign relation as if sort of this touch some other country but in the usual case i think we have ask what be the interference what be the disruption so tell me what the interference or the disruption be the problem we would create not just the fact that it have something to do with another country I be sure mexico care a lot about this the question I be ask be how do the presence of the bivens remedy disrupt or interfere with the united state ability to carry out its foreign policy I be sure it would not have to be write that way laughter if the if the border patrol agent stand where he stand and take the shot he do and the only difference be that the teenager in the culvert be an american citizen be there a bivens action ,315.3100000000001,Roberts Court,"Feb 21, 2017","Jesus C.

2016,Weaver v. Massachusetts,114,Elena Kagan,"But, in a way, Mr. Kimberly, I mean, you don't have to convince us of that, do you? Yeah. No. I'm saying you don't have to convince us, because -- because one of the things that we've said over and over about structural error is that it's -- it's impossible to show how they affected the trial. And -- and that's really what's at issue here, is whether we should put the defendant to the burden of showing how it affected the trial, when, in fact, we've said over and over that you can't do that. So whether they're important, whether they're not important, whether they're critical to fundamental fairness or not, you know, is, in some ways, beside the point. Mr. -- Mr. Ravitz, I don't know, maybe this is a simple-minded way to look at things, but I've always thought Strickland, it's about the fairness and the reliability of the trial process. And that's a pretty important thing to be concerned about. And we have said as part of Strickland that you have to show prejudice, because we're not really concerned about lawyers, however bad they may be, who do things that just don't affect the reliability of the trial. But here, with respect to these structural errors, what we've said again and again and again is we actually just don't know. So the -- in any particular case, whether the commission of this error affected the outcome. So what you are suggesting to us is that the defendant has to come in and prove as part of Strickland -- which, as I said, is integral to ensuring the fairness and reliability of the process -- has to come in and prove as part of that something that we have said, time and again, is unprovable. And that just seems like that's not something that a legal system should do. You have to prove something that we've admitted is unprovable. Well, but then what you're asking us to do is you're asking us to apply Strickland in such a way that we're saying this terrible attorney error took place because we're assuming that. And we think it might -- it could have affected the outcome of the trial, but because of the kind of error it is, as we've said a hundred times, we just are not able to -- to say that with any certainty, so we'll give the benefit of the doubt to the government. I -- I just -- I'm sorry to keep, like, bugging you about this, but it just seems so Kafkaesque to me. It's like you have to prove something, but we know you can't prove it. But we've said it. We've said it a hundred times. (Laughter.) But I thought your understanding of Batson was that you were saying when an attorney is deficient, as respects to a Batson claim, there, too, you would say that -- sort of too bad. But that's the underlying violation of the ineffective assistance claim. And you would say the same rule would go, and you have to prove prejudice. Even though we've said over and over that you can't prove prejudice. You know, I'm not saying that there aren't cases where you can have a sort of gut intuition as to whether it did or not. But one of the things that have made us put these particular rights in this box called ""structural"" is that we say, you know, notwithstanding that you can pick out a case here and there and say, okay. I kind of know. In general, these are -- it is so speculative as to whether this fundamental defect in the trial process caused error that we're going to -- to -- to presume it. I don't think we've ever really talked about burdens when we label things structural errors. You know, we don't say, oh, you haven't met your burden. I mean, what we've said is that the whole burden analysis kind of goes out the window because this is so hard to prove because it's so speculative. So it's really not a question of who has the burden. It's just never been the way we've addressed the structural error category. Well, it's not meant to be easy, but it's meant to be possible. And what we've said in our structural error cases is that it's not possible in a very, very large proportion of them. ",but in a way mr kimberly i mean you do not have to convince us of that do you yeah no I be say you do not have to convince us because because one of the thing that we have say over and over about structural error be that it be it be impossible to show how they affect the trial and and that be really what be at issue here be whether we should put the defendant to the burden of show how it affect the trial when in fact we have say over and over that you can not do that so whether they be important whether they be not important whether they be critical to fundamental fairness or not you know be in some way beside the point mr mr ravitz i do not know maybe this be a simple minded way to look at thing but I have always think strickland it be about the fairness and the reliability of the trial process and that be a pretty important thing to be concern about and we have say as part of strickland that you have to show prejudice because we be not really concern about lawyer however bad they may be who do thing that just do not affect the reliability of the trial but here with respect to these structural error what we have say again and again and again be we actually just do not know so the in any particular case whether the commission of this error affect the outcome so what you be suggest to us be that the defendant have to come in and prove as part of strickland which as i say be integral to ensure the fairness and reliability of the process have to come in and prove as part of that something that we have say time and again be unprovable and that just seem like that be not something that a legal system should do you have to prove something that we have admit be unprovable well but then what you be ask us to do be you be ask us to apply strickland in such a way that we be say this terrible attorney error take place because we be assume that and we think it might it could have affect the outcome of the trial but because of the kind of error it be as we have say a hundred time we just be not able to to say that with any certainty so we will give the benefit of the doubt to the government i i just I be sorry to keep like bug you about this but it just seem so kafkaesque to me it be like you have to prove something but we know you can not prove it but we have say it we have say it a hundred time laughter but i think your understanding of batson be that you we be say when an attorney be deficient as respect to a batson claim there too you would say that sort of too bad but that be the underlying violation of the ineffective assistance claim and you would say the same rule would go and you have to prove prejudice even though we have say over and over that you can not prove prejudice you know I be not say that there be not case where you can have a sort of gut intuition as to whether it do or not but one of the thing that have make us put these particular right in this box call structural be that we say you know notwithstanding that you can pick out a case here and there and say okay i kind of know in general these be it be so speculative as to whether this fundamental defect in the trial process cause error that we be go to to to presume it i do not think we have ever really talk about burden when we label thing structural error you know we do not say oh you have not meet your burden i mean what we have say be that the whole burden analysis kind of go out the window because this be so hard to prove because it be so speculative so it be really not a question of who have the burden it be just never be the way we have address the structural error category well it be not mean to be easy but it be mean to be possible and what we have say in our structural error case be that it be not possible in a very very large proportion of them ,238.66000000000003,Roberts Court,"Apr 19, 2017",Kentel Myrone Weave,Commonwealth of Massachusetts,16-240,"Jan 13, 2017","Jun 22, 2017",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2016,Goodyear Tire v. Haeger,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Bergeron, could I go back to the question that the Chief Justice asked you. You said that you favored the approach of Fox v. Vice, which is a but-for test. It's would you have incurred this cost anyway even -- -- without the misconduct. But Fox v. Vice never uses this language of directness, which seems to me actually much more in line with proximate cause inquiries. Now, Fox v. Vice, you know, never addressed proximate cause either way. It wasn't a proximate cause fact pattern. This actually seems not really a proximate cause fact pattern either; it just seems as though it's a -- you know, should there be a but-for test. So I guess I'm wondering, where does this language of -- you say ""but for,"" but you also say ""direct."" What do you mean when you use those two terms? Well, suppose we say that the Fox v. Vice but-for test is something along the lines of what we should be applying here. So how does -- in your reply brief, you basically say that a court can ""never."" You don't -- you don't just say in this case it was wrong. In your reply brief, you say a court can never say, look, the case would have settled right away, and all costs ought to go to the victimized party. Why is that? If it's a but-for test, why couldn't a court on a proper set of facts say, look, if this -- if this abuse hadn't occurred, this case would just never have gone on? Well, I don't know what -- what -- too speculative. I mean, the Court says, look, I understand that I have to find this; you know, that it's more likely than not. That's how we make findings about what costs would have been incurred anyway. Would -- you know, there's never any certainty. We're always saying more likely than not, would this cost have been incurred? I think none of the costs of this suit would have been incurred if this abuse hadn't taken place. Yes, but if a lack of certainty like that is going to prevent a judge from actually making an award, then people on the other side, people who are victimized, are going to be undercompensated in case after case after case. When the district court gave these two awards, the 2.7 and the 2 million, do you understand that to have been 2.7 if I'm not bound by a cause requirement; 2 million if I am? So then why hasn't that been done already in the district court? In other words, if you're right, that there is a causation requirement here, we send it back to the district court, hasn't the district court already performed that calculation? What's the difference between the 2 million and the 2.7? What is the $700,000 in there; costs for what? What costs do you concede you're responsible for? So how much is that? But that's not anything like the full 2 million? You said you wanted to use the Fox v. Vice standard, and part of that is the but-for causation inquiry. And part of that is a pretty clear statement that we don't expect district court judges to be, you know, green eye-shade accountants, is I think what we called them. To go over each, you know, hour of an attorney's work. We understand the district courts are going to have to make some broad categories and some guesstimates. Do you agree with that too? Is it odd that the -- But -- but, Mr. Bergeron, you're saying well, you should use a causation test, but you can't ever consider the likelihood of settlement. But the likelihood of settlement might be -- might not be here, but might be in another case, quite relevant to the question of what fees have been caused by the misconduct. Well, why did she say -- Why -- why did the district court set two standards, the 2.7 and the 2.0, if she thought that she was bound by causation? I thought that the -- that the whole idea of those two was, one was, if I'm bound by a causation requirement and one was if I'm not. You said you were going to respond to Justice Alito's statements from the Ninth Circuit. I have another one to give you. I mean, this is the closest, it seems to me, as to a standard that comes from the Ninth Circuit, that the district court awarded the amount that the Court reasonably believed it cost the Haegers to litigate against a party during the time when that party was acting in bad faith. So it seems to me that the Ninth Circuit was viewing this chronologically. When the party was acting in bad faith, all of those costs are -- and fees are appropriate. ",mr bergeron could i go back to the question that the chief justice ask you you say that you favor the approach of fox v vice which be a but for test it be would you have incur this cost anyway even without the misconduct but fox v vice never use this language of directness which seem to me actually much more in line with proximate because inquiry now fox v vice you know never address proximate because either way it be not a proximate because fact pattern this actually seem not really a proximate because fact pattern either it just seem as though it be a you know should there be a but for test so i guess I be wonder where do this language of you say but for but you also say direct what do you mean when you use those two term well suppose we say that the fox v vice but for test be something along the line of what we should be apply here so how do in your reply brief you basically say that a court can never you do not you do not just say in this case it be wrong in your reply brief you say a court can never say look the case would have settle right away and all cost ought to go to the victimize party why be that if it be a but for test why could not a court on a proper set of fact say look if this if this abuse have not occur this case would just never have go on well i do not know what what too speculative i mean the court say look i understand that i have to find this you know that it be more likely than not that be how we make finding about what cost would have be incur anyway would you know there be never any certainty we be always say more likely than not would this cost have be incur i think none of the cost of this suit would have be incur if this abuse have not take place yes but if a lack of certainty like that be go to prevent a judge from actually make an award then people on the other side people who be victimize be go to be undercompensated in case after case after case when the district court give these two award the and the million do you understand that to have be if I be not bind by a because requirement million if i be so then why have not that be do already in the district court in other word if you be right that there be a causation requirement here we send it back to the district court have not the district court already perform that calculation what be the difference between the million and the what be the in there cost for what what cost do you concede you be responsible for so how much be that but that be not anything like the full million you say you want to use the fox v vice standard and part of that be the but for causation inquiry and part of that be a pretty clear statement that we do not expect district court judge to be you know green eye shade accountant be i think what we call them to go over each you know hour of an attorney s work we understand the district court be go to have to make some broad category and some guesstimate do you agree with that too be it odd that the but but mr bergeron you be say well you should use a causation test but you can not ever consider the likelihood of settlement but the likelihood of settlement might be might not be here but might be in another case quite relevant to the question of what fee have be cause by the misconduct well why do she say why why do the district court set two standard the and the if she think that she be bind by causation i think that the that the whole idea of those two be one be if I be bind by a causation requirement and one be if I be not you say you we be go to respond to justice alito s statement from the ninth circuit i have another one to give you i mean this be the close it seem to me as to a standard that come from the ninth circuit that the district court award the amount that the court reasonably believe it cost the haegers to litigate against a party during the time when that party be act in bad faith so it seem to me that the ninth circuit be view this chronologically when the party be act in bad faith all of those cost be and fee be appropriate ,271.67,Roberts Court,"Jan 10, 2017",Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company,"Leroy Haeger, et al.",15-1406,"Sep 29, 2016","Apr 18, 2017",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

2016,County of Los Angeles v. Mendez,114,Elena Kagan,"Can I -- Can I ask about the first theory, because you said if there was a violation -- excuse me -- of the knock-and-announce rule, and a death or an injury proximately caused by that violation, then there could be recovery.

In other words, this case you don't have the knock-and-announce violation; you have a different constitutional violation, which is an unauthorized entry. And why would it not be the case that the -- that the death or injury in such a case is also proximately caused by that violation? In other words, proximate cause says what kind of things are foreseeable, and it says -- it sets an outer bound, and it says totally flukey, random things we're not going to say are proximately caused. But it doesn't seem to me a flukey or random thing to say when there is an authorized entry into somebody's home, violence may well result. And so the proximate cause analysis seems to flow in much the same way, maybe not to quite the same -- like with -- quite the same obviousness, but in much the same way as in your knock-and-announce example. It's -- it's a simple question, Mr. Rosenkranz. You said something about knock and announce. I say why isn't the same theory applicable when the constitutional violation is unauthorized entry into somebody's home? That is an unauthorized entry into somebody's home. So that is the clearly established constitutional violation. Why isn't the proximate cause -- why it -- why wouldn't it be that a death or injury that results when somebody barges into, goes into somebody's home without legal authorization, that one of the things that foreseeably can result from that is a shooting? But it might very well change -- It might very well change the outcome. When somebody shows up with a warrant, they show it -- they show the warrant, they have legal authority, people act very differently than when somebody shows up with no warrant and says, I don't have authority. I'm coming in anyway. That's a very different set of circumstances that a homeowner has to respond to. And what is for -- what foreseeably happens where there is a warrant is not the same thing. When somebody -- when a police officer has legal authority, tells the homeowner he has legal authority, the set of results that happens is just not the same as when a police officer just says, ""I'm here, I don't have any legal authority, I'm coming in anyway"". Well, it's -- it's possible. I mean, I take the point, Mr. Rosenkranz, it's possible that you have a warrant in your pocket and you don't say anything about it, although that would seem like very silly -- stupid police work. But the prototypical case when somebody has a warrant is that they tell a homeowner they have a warrant and that they have a right to be on the premises. That's what usually happens. And similarly, what often happens is that when somebody doesn't say that to a homeowner, they are making it far more likely that violence will ensue. And certainly the kind of violence that could ensue is not the kind of flukey, random stuff that is filtered out by a proximate cause inquiry. Do you -- -- before -- can I just -- do you agree in general, before you address the question in particular, do you agree in general what that framing -- that if there is an independent constitutional violation and if it does proximately cause the injury, then there's a 1983 action? So that seems fair enough. But then the question might become, whether here or on remand, whether an unauthorized entry, where there was a clearly established violation, whether one could say that that was the proximate cause of the shooting. But one of -- a warrant violation is just -- it's -- it's just saying unauthorized entry. And the question is whether it's within the normal scope of the risk, but an unauthorized entry produces violence, not that it always or probably produces violence, but that it might produce violence in the way we kind of ask when we do proximate cause analysis. Doesn't have to, normally. It doesn't have to -- Or -- you know, proximate cause is just we filter out the really fluky stuff. I guess I'm not understanding, Mr. Feldman, why you're quite making this distinction. I mean, it -- it -- why isn't it just, look, the entry without authority, the entry without a warrant, that's a clear but-for cause of the shooting? The shooting wouldn't have happened if there hadn't been the entry; right? Now the question is, is it a but -- is it a proximate cause of the inquiry? And it -- and it seems to me that you have to make a case -- and tell me if you agree or don't agree: You have to make a case that unauthorized entry, that one of the -- one of the things that foreseeably can happen with an unauthorized entry is that the person whose home it is will react with violence. Can I say this -- Well, can I suggest why it might matter? I mean, there are two kinds of entry: One is -- let's -- for these purposes, one is an authorized entry and one is an unauthorized entry. Now the question is, what kind of conduct does each of those kinds of entries provoke? If you're an authorized entry, you don't really think that it's going to provoke violence. But if you're an unauthorized entry, you do think it's going to provoke violence. So the -- -- proximate cause -- the -- the proximate results of each of those two different kinds of entry are very different. Mr. Feldman, you said there are two kinds of entrance; right? One is a trespasser entrant, and one is a nontrespasser entrant. A guest entrant, let's call the person; right? And when a trespasser enters your home, different sets of things foreseeably happen -- -- than when a guest enters your home. So it's not just an entry. The question is, who's entering: a trespasser or a guest? ",can i can i ask about the first theory because you say if there be a violation excuse me of the knock and announce rule and a death or an injury proximately cause by that violation then there could be recovery be that what you say yes yeah yeah yeah of course and this be qualified immunity context everything have to be a violation of clearly establish law quite right so i guess the question be why be this case any different in other word this case you do not have the knock and announce violation you have a different constitutional violation which be an unauthorized entry and why would it not be the case that the that the death or injury in such a case be also proximately cause by that violation in other word proximate because say what kind of thing be foreseeable and it say it set an outer bound and it say totally flukey random thing we be not go to say be proximately cause but it do not seem to me a flukey or random thing to say when there be an authorized entry into somebody s home violence may well result and so the proximate because analysis seem to flow in much the same way maybe not to quite the same like with quite the same obviousness but in much the same way as in your knock and announce example it be it be a simple question mr rosenkranz you say something about knock and announce i say why be not the same theory applicable when the constitutional violation be unauthorized entry into somebody s home that be an unauthorized entry into somebody s home so that be the clearly establish constitutional violation why be not the proximate because why it why would not it be that a death or injury that result when somebody barge into go into somebody s home without legal authorization that one of the thing that foreseeably can result from that be a shooting but it might very well change it might very well change the outcome when somebody show up with a warrant they show it they show the warrant they have legal authority people act very differently than when somebody show up with no warrant and say i do not have authority I be come in anyway that be a very different set of circumstance that a homeowner have to respond to and what be for what foreseeably happen where there be a warrant be not the same thing when somebody when a police officer have legal authority tell the homeowner he have legal authority the set of result that happen be just not the same as when a police officer just say I be here i do not have any legal authority I be come in anyway well it be it be possible i mean i take the point mr rosenkranz it be possible that you have a warrant in your pocket and you do not say anything about it although that would seem like very silly stupid police work but the prototypical case when somebody have a warrant be that they tell a homeowner they have a warrant and that they have a right to be on the premise that be what usually happen and similarly what often happen be that when somebody do not say that to a homeowner they be make it far more likely that violence will ensue and certainly the kind of violence that could ensue be not the kind of flukey random stuff that be filter out by a proximate because inquiry do you before can i just do you agree in general before you address the question in particular do you agree in general what that frame that if there be an independent constitutional violation and if it do proximately because the injury then there be a action so that seem fair enough but then the question might become whether here or on remand whether an unauthorized entry where there be a clearly establish violation whether one could say that that be the proximate because of the shooting but one of a warrant violation be just it be it be just say unauthorized entry and the question be whether it be within the normal scope of the risk but an unauthorized entry produce violence not that it always or probably produce violence but that it might produce violence in the way we kind of ask when we do proximate because analysis do not have to normally it do not have to or you know proximate because be just we filter out the really fluky stuff i guess I be not understanding mr feldman why you be quite make this distinction i mean it it why be not it just look the entry without authority the entry without a warrant that be a clear but for because of the shooting the shoot would not have happen if there have not be the entry right now the question be be it a but be it a proximate because of the inquiry and it and it seem to me that you have to make a case and tell me if you agree or do not agree you have to make a case that unauthorized entry that one of the one of the thing that foreseeably can happen with an unauthorized entry be that the person whose home it be will react with violence can i say this well can i suggest why it might matter i mean there be two kind of entry one be let us for these purpose one be an authorized entry and one be an unauthorized entry now the question be what kind of conduct do each of those kind of entry provoke if you be an authorized entry you do not really think that it be go to provoke violence but if you be an unauthorized entry you do think it be go to provoke violence so the proximate because the the proximate result of each of those two different kind of entry be very different mr feldman you say there be two kind of entrance right one be a trespasser entrant and one be a nontrespasser entrant a guest entrant let us call the person right and when a trespasser enter your home different set of thing foreseeably happen than when a guest enter your home so it be not just an entry the question be who be enter a trespasser or a guest ,359.84,Roberts Court,"Mar 22, 2017","County of Los Angeles, et al.","Angel Mendez, et

2016,Kokesh v. SEC,114,Elena Kagan,"What is the private statute of limitations? But that -- but that might suggest something along the lines of what Justice Ginsburg suggested, that if the government, in fact, puts this money into the hands of victims, then it is compensatory; whereas if the government keeps it, it's not. And that the rule should follow, depending on which is true. Ms. Goldenberg, in those 50 years, has -- has the SEC or has the Justice Department ever set down in writing what the guidelines are for how the SEC is going to use disgorgement and what's going to happen to the monies collected? I must say I find it unusual that the SEC has not given some guidance to its enforcement department or -- or that the Department of Justice hasn't become involved in some way; that -- that everything is just sort of up to the particular person at the SEC who decides to bring such a case. Do you agree or disagree -- I'm a little -- left a little bit unclear. Mr. Unikowsky's standard is that if something is not solely remedial, then it's a penalty. Do you agree with that? And you disagree with any punitive aspect. So if something is not solely remedial, it is a penalty. Because I look at this and -- and it seems to be a commonsensical kind of way of looking at the way this remedy works, the way the SEC has used it, is that it's trying to do a lot of things. It's trying to compensate. It's trying to deter. It's trying, to some extent, to punish misconduct that it -- it sees, you know, and that it's a little bit artificial to try to tear them apart. And then if you accept Mr. Unikowsky's standard, that suggests that he has the better of the arguments. So why is that wrong? Yeah, but I guess -- I guess when I said ""punish,"" I don't mean to make that sound as a conclusion. I mean just to say, it's tied to -- to particular misconduct. So -- so it's -- it's very much relating to a -- an offense. Just -- just out of curiosity, when -- I'm sorry. When -- when the SEC uses this, is it usually going after continuing misconduct, or does it sometimes really reach back into the past for completed conduct?

2016,Advocate Health Care Network v. Stapleton,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, still, Ms. Blatt, there is a -- you know, there would be a simple way of accomplishing what you think this provision accomplishes. You know, something along the lines of just saying any plan maintained by a church-affiliated organization is a church plan or something like that. It's -- it's very odd language, this statutory language, and I'm wondering why you think that Congress chose to do what you think it chose to do in this perplexing way rather than in a straightforward way? Mr. Stewart, can I ask you about some of the Respondents' hypotheticals where they offer hypothetical statutes that are very similar in structure to this one? And it's pretty clear that you would read, you know, the one about disabled veterans and the one about the two presidential criteria, and it's pretty clear that you would read those sentences their way rather than your way; in other words, as just going to one of the criteria. And I'm wondering why you think that's true, that they can come up with these hypotheticals that so clearly should be interpreted their way rather than your way. I mean, that would seem ridiculous, right? See, I -- I would think that the way that hypothetical works, it's sort of -- we're setting these two criteria, you have to be a veteran and you have to be disabled, and then we're going to say there's a special case of veterans. We also mean to include National Guard folks, and that's not disqualifying, the fact that it's a National Guard folks. But the two criteria are still the two criteria. All we're suggesting is that it's not disqualifying that you are a National Guard. And you could read this language similarly. It's not disqualifying that it's maintained by a different kind of organization. Well, but I guess that's the question, right? And the structure is the same. Well, why would you -- Why would you repeat the requirement of the A? In other words, Congress could have just said a plan maintained by a church includes a plan maintained by one of these organizations. But I would have thought that the -- the one thing that seems most clear from a pretty murky legislative history is the church pension boards were supposed to be included in this. And the church pension boards, some of them were established -- their plans were established by the church, some of them not. So you would be taking out some of these church pension boards that I thought are the sort of quintessential group that this was designed to include. ",well still ms blatt there be a you know there would be a simple way of accomplish what you think this provision accomplish you know something along the line of just say any plan maintain by a church affiliated organization be a church plan or something like that it be it be very odd language this statutory language and I be wonder why you think that congress choose to do what you think it choose to do in this perplexing way rather than in a straightforward way mr stewart can i ask you about some of the respondent hypothetical where they offer hypothetical statute that be very similar in structure to this one and it be pretty clear that you would read you know the one about disable veteran and the one about the two presidential criterion and it be pretty clear that you would read those sentence their way rather than your way in other word as just go to one of the criterion and I be wonder why you think that be true that they can come up with these hypothetical that so clearly should be interpret their way rather than your way i mean that would seem ridiculous right see i i would think that the way that hypothetical work it be sort of we be set these two criterion you have to be a veteran and you have to be disable and then we be go to say there be a special case of veteran we also mean to include national guard folk and that be not disqualify the fact that it be a national guard folk but the two criterion be still the two criterion all we be suggest be that it be not disqualify that you be a national guard and you could read this language similarly it be not disqualify that it be maintain by a different kind of organization well but i guess that be the question right and the structure be the same well why would you why would you repeat the requirement of the a in other word congress could have just say a plan maintain by a church include a plan maintain by one of these organization but i would have think that the the one thing that seem most clear from a pretty murky legislative history be the church pension boards we be suppose to be include in this and the church pension board some of them we be establish their plan we be establish by the church some of them not so you would be take out some of these church pension board that i thought be the sort of quintessential group that this be design to include ,154.36,Roberts Court,"Mar 27, 2017","Advocate Health Care Network, et al.","Maria Stapleton, et al.",16-74,"Dec 2, 2016","Jun 5, 2017",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2016,Bravo-Fernandez v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"Ms. Blatt, it does seem to me that's what your argument rests on in the end: The idea that we shouldn't give any weight or any influence to an invalid conviction. Is that a double jeopardy principle, or does it come from someplace else? Yes. Well, why do we do that? I mean, I take it you have -- you know, usually you do pretend that they don't exist. There are not many instances that we can find where we do look to vacated convictions for something or other. But in this case, the vacated conviction surely does tell us something about what the jury did do or what the jury didn't do. It's part of the factual picture, and so the question has to be, well, notwithstanding that, why shouldn't we look at it? And I guess the -- why? You know, I think you're contesting the premise of my question. Because the premise of my question is that this vacated conviction does tell you something about what the jury did. Now what it tells you is that the jury did inconsistent things, because the vacated conviction tells you that, on the one hand, the valid convictions, the jury said that there was not bribery. And on the other hand, the vacated conviction, the jury said there was bribery. And let's assume for the moment that that's true, that that is exactly what the vacated convictions tell you. They tell you that the jury went in two inconsistent ways. And now you're saying, notwithstanding that the vacated conviction tells you something about what the jury did or didn't do about how the jury reasoned, we shouldn't look at it. And there's something very powerful, rhetorically, in your statement. But I guess what I'm trying to figure out: Is it anything more than rhetoric? Is -- -- there, like, a legal principle here about why we shouldn't look to vacated convictions to tell us something about the facts, when they can tell us something about the facts? I'm sorry. I -- Maybe one way I can figure out the scope of your argument is just to ask, do you think that the government is always unable to use a vacated conviction, that is for any purpose, or do you think that the government is unable to use a vacated conviction only for double jeopardy purposes? So you have the history on your side, most of it. Do you think that that's because the government, you know, cannot use a vacated conviction for any purpose? This isn't a double jeopardy argument. This is a something else argument. But what is it? What is the something else? Why can't the government use a vacated conviction for any purpose? Look at the label. It's void ab initio, but I mean, it's void in the sense that you can't be punished for a vacated conviction. But the question is, can we use what the vacated conviction tells us about a historical fact, or can we use it for some other purpose that, you know, that I'm not thinking about right now? But -- but, you know, what's -- what part of the Constitution are we looking to to tell us this? That's not the question I'm asking. What other purpose could you use a vacated conviction for? Is there anything else that the government can use a vacated conviction for, or is this the only thing? Who -- who's not -- Ms. Blatt suggested that there's something -- I think she used the word ""unseemly"" -- about using a vacated conviction for this, or indeed for any other purpose, given the traditions of our legal system where it's just very hard to find instances in which we have done so. So, you know, I'm not sure I understand where the unseemliness prohibition comes from, but it does seem, you now, quite out of kilter with the traditions of our legal system to use vacated convictions in a manner that affects individuals' constitutional rights. So, I guess, tell me why we shouldn't be concerned about that? I think the tradition goes further. I mean, you have a tough time in your brief coming up with any instances, and the only times you do are -- are some -- a couple of scattered lower court decisions. But you have, other than that, a really tough time coming up with any instances in which courts have used vacated convictions for any purpose. But that is the greater remedy that Yeager gave, and I understand your distinction between Yeager and this case, but it does leave you with a fundamental anomaly, which is, in a case in which there's an acquittal and a hung count, the acquittal is the only thing that matters. And in a case where there's an acquittal and a vacated conviction, you know, where a court has said this has got to be -- this has got to be reversed and it no longer exists, in that case the person comes up with a far less good situation. It makes sense in terms of parts of Yeager's reasoning, but not in terms of other parts of Yeager's reasoning. Another part of Yeager's reasoning just said hung counts have never been accorded respect as a matter of law or history. And similarly, one could say vacated convictions have never been accorded respect as a matter of law or history. They are vacated. They are nullities. You don't get respect for that. Well, I guess I see -- when I read Yeager, I see two different rationales, and on one you're exactly right. There's a real distinction with this case. On the other, seems you're exactly wrong. There's no distinction in this case at all because both have never been accorded respect as a matter of law or history. ",ms blatt it do seem to me that be what your argument rest on in the end the idea that we should not give any weight or any influence to an invalid conviction be that a double jeopardy principle or do it come from someplace else yes well why do we do that i mean i take it you have you know usually you do pretend that they do not exist there be not many instance that we can find where we do look to vacated conviction for something or other but in this case the vacated conviction surely do tell us something about what the jury do do or what the jury do not do it be part of the factual picture and so the question have to be well notwithstanding that why should not we look at it and i guess the why you know i think you be contest the premise of my question because the premise of my question be that this vacated conviction do tell you something about what the jury do now what it tell you be that the jury do inconsistent thing because the vacated conviction tell you that on the one hand the valid conviction the jury say that there be not bribery and on the other hand the vacated conviction the jury say there be bribery and let us assume for the moment that that be true that that be exactly what the vacated conviction tell you they tell you that the jury go in two inconsistent way and now you be say notwithstanding that the vacated conviction tell you something about what the jury do or do not do about how the jury reason we should not look at it and there be something very powerful rhetorically in your statement but i guess what I be try to figure out be it anything more than rhetoric be there like a legal principle here about why we should not look to vacated conviction to tell us something about the fact when they can tell us something about the fact I be sorry i maybe one way i can figure out the scope of your argument be just to ask do you think that the government be always unable to use a vacated conviction that be for any purpose or do you think that the government be unable to use a vacated conviction only for double jeopardy purpose so you have the history on your side most of it do you think that that be because the government you know can not use a vacated conviction for any purpose this be not a double jeopardy argument this be a something else argument but what be it what be the something else why can not the government use a vacated conviction for any purpose look at the label it be void ab initio but i mean it be void in the sense that you can not be punish for a vacated conviction but the question be can we use what the vacated conviction tell us about a historical fact or can we use it for some other purpose that you know that I be not think about right now but but you know what be what part of the constitution be we look to to tell us this that be not the question I be ask what other purpose could you use a vacated conviction for be there anything else that the government can use a vacated conviction for or be this the only thing who who be not ms blatt suggest that there be something i think she use the word unseemly about use a vacated conviction for this or indeed for any other purpose give the tradition of our legal system where it be just very hard to find instance in which we have do so so you know I be not sure i understand where the unseemliness prohibition come from but it do seem you now quite out of kilter with the tradition of our legal system to use vacated conviction in a manner that affect individual constitutional right so i guess tell me why we should not be concern about that i think the tradition go far i mean you have a tough time in your brief come up with any instance and the only time you do be be some a couple of scattered low court decision but you have other than that a really tough time come up with any instance in which court have use vacated conviction for any purpose but that be the great remedy that yeager give and i understand your distinction between yeager and this case but it do leave you with a fundamental anomaly which be in a case in which there be an acquittal and a hung count the acquittal be the only thing that matter and in a case where there be an acquittal and a vacated conviction you know where a court have say this have get to be this have get to be reverse and it no longer exist in that case the person come up with a far less good situation it make sense in term of part of yeager s reasoning but not in term of other part of yeager s reasoning another part of yeager s reasoning just say hung count have never be accord respect as a matter of law or history and similarly one could say vacated conviction have never be accord respect as a matter of law or history they be vacate they be nullity you do not get respect for that well i guess i see when i read yeager i see two different rationale and on one you be exactly right there be a real distinction with this case on the other seem you be exactly wrong there be no distinction in this case at all because both have never be accord respect as a matter of law or history ,322.35,Roberts Court,"Oct 4, 2016","Juan Bravo-Fernandez, et al.",United States,15-537,"Mar 28, 2016","Nov

2016,Dean v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"But just -- Just assume the 1028 for a moment didn't exist and say you had to argue from this language, and this essentially repeats Justice Ginsburg's point, but this language says, ""It shall run consecutively, it shall not run concurrently."" And your version of this statute essentially allows a district court to negate that language. It's as if that language were not there in terms of what the -- the -- the district court can do. Well, ""some sentence,"" you know, a day, six hours, whatever it is, but can essentially make that -- that disappear. I mean, you know, it's concurrent plus a day. I mean, that couldn't have been what Congress meant, concurrent plus a day, when it said, ""It shall only be consecutive."" Well, you're right. The Congress did not say you -- it did not say what it said, in fact, in 1028A. But, you know, sometimes, sometimes the way we try to understand statutes is to say any reading that utterly eviscerates something that Congress clearly did say can't be a good reading. She's Justice Sotomayor. She was the one helping you. (Laughter.) I was the one who wasn't. (Laughter.) Well, that's -- That's -- That's -- But what are you suggesting ought to happen? I mean, presumably, the guidelines reflect an idea that there shouldn't be any double-counting of the gun, right? So what does -- how does the court do the -- the sentence on the underlying crime, taking away the fact of the gun? In other words, most robberies have guns in them, and the sentences are written to reflect that they have guns in them, don't they? Aren't they? What you think ought to happen is that the -- is that the judge should say, okay, imagine a robbery without a gun, what would be a reasonable sentence for that. Well, offense conduct, does that mean without a gun? Well that's where I don't understand your -- your answer to Justice Kennedy, because you said, no, you're not saying that 924 supersedes 3553. I think you have to be saying that. You might still be right, but you have to be saying that there's this background principle, which is 3553, which is this parsimony principle and all these factors, and then 924 comes along and says, but not here. One way you might look at this, and this goes back to what the Chief Justice said, he said, well, when there's a 30-year sentence implicated, you better be pretty clear. And also when you're legislating against a fairly strong background principle of 3553, you better be pretty clear that you're displacing that background principle. And here, you're just not -- you just have not been clear enough. You were clear enough in 1028(a) We know what that looks like. But here, you just haven't been clear enough to upset this background presumption. Counsel -- But I don't think you have to go to a principle of lenity for Mr. Stoler to be right. I mean, you were just saying this is very much along the lines of what the Chief Justice was saying. You would just say something like, look, if we're going to be strictly textualist here, this does not have the kind of requirement you wish it had, which is to say it doesn't have the language that's in 1028A. Your essential argument is that, read Mr. Stoler's way, this would utterly eviscerate (c)(1)(D)(ii), the consecutive requirement. And I'm quite sympathetic to that. But there's still this question of when a statute doesn't say what you would like it to say and you're reduced to saying if you read it the other guy's way, it would eviscerate what we -- what we meant when we passed another provision, you know, what -- what should we do and where do you point us? ",but just just assume the for a moment do not exist and say you have to argue from this language and this essentially repeat justice ginsburg s point but this language say it shall run consecutively it shall not run concurrently and your version of this statute essentially allow a district court to negate that language it be as if that language we be not there in term of what the the the district court can do well some sentence you know a day six hour whatever it be but can essentially make that that disappear i mean you know it be concurrent plus a day i mean that could not have be what congress mean concurrent plus a day when it say it shall only be consecutive well you be right the congress do not say you it do not say what it say in fact in a but you know sometimes sometimes the way we try to understand statute be to say any reading that utterly eviscerates something that congress clearly do say can not be a good reading she be justice sotomayor she be the one help you laughter i be the one who be not laughter well that be that be that be but what be you suggest ought to happen i mean presumably the guideline reflect an idea that there should not be any double counting of the gun right so what do how do the court do the the sentence on the underlying crime take away the fact of the gun in other word most robbery have gun in them and the sentence be write to reflect that they have gun in them do not they be not they what you think ought to happen be that the be that the judge should say okay imagine a robbery without a gun what would be a reasonable sentence for that well offense conduct do that mean without a gun well that be where i do not understand your your answer to justice kennedy because you say no you be not say that supersedes i think you have to be say that you might still be right but you have to be say that there be this background principle which be which be this parsimony principle and all these factor and then come along and say but not here one way you might look at this and this go back to what the chief justice say he say well when there be a year sentence implicate you better be pretty clear and also when you be legislate against a fairly strong background principle of you better be pretty clear that you be displace that background principle and here you be just not you just have not be clear enough you we be clear enough in a we know what that look like but here you just have not be clear enough to upset this background presumption counsel but i do not think you have to go to a principle of lenity for mr stoler to be right i mean you we be just say this be very much along the line of what the chief justice be say you would just say something like look if we be go to be strictly textualist here this do not have the kind of requirement you wish it have which be to say it do not have the language that be in a your essential argument be that read mr stoler s way this would utterly eviscerate c d ii the consecutive requirement and I be quite sympathetic to that but there be still this question of when a statute do not say what you would like it to say and you be reduce to say if you read it the other guy s way it would eviscerate what we what we mean when we pass another provision you know what what should we do and where do you point us ,226.75,Roberts Court,"Feb 28, 2017","Levon Dean, Jr.",United States,15-9260,"Oct 28, 2016","Apr 3, 2017",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2016,Microsoft v. Baker,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Fisher -- Please. And may I ask, a lot of your briefing in this case operates on the premise that there really was -- that this claim will spring back, that there was some kind of reservation -- -- of rights such that this claim would spring back. And I'm wondering why you think that. Where do you get that from? I mean, was this something that the parties, just a general understanding in this case that they were dismissing it, but that it would spring back if they won the appeal? I guess I read your brief, so I have largely bought into that assumption. And if that were true, it does seem to me like you have an awfully good argument, but it would not be final, then, under 1291. And I guess I was just asking why it was that your brief essentially, you know, for two-thirds of the brief or more, bought into that assumption, whether there was something that I didn't see or some general understanding that the parties had that -- that suggested that assumption was the right one to make. Well, do you think that should be something? The -- the lower courts did not address that question. And -- and that question seems, at least in part, dependent on fact, that -- that -- that you would think the lower courts might have some better view on than we do. Would that suggest a remand on that question? There was no discovery here? So just -- -- out of curiosity -- I'm sorry. And what criteria did they use? But what did they really use? Did they, you know, basically take a peek at the merits? What did they do? Just before the -- So there -- there is this one case that suggested that that is what would happen. I mean, is this a procedure that's used in the Ninth Circuit? What is it used for? Why did people think that this was the governing law? Could -- Could I take you back, sorry, just to this sort of nonreservation reservation point. You said there were two things that you did that fit with the Ninth Circuit's procedure. You said it wasn't settled, and you said that you were going to appeal; is that right? Right. So where -- where did those requirements come from? You know, if I looked at what cases would I find that that's what you have to do in order to prejudice -- in order to dismiss something with prejudice in such a way that it springs back to life if you win the appeal? ",mr fisher please and may i ask a lot of your briefing in this case operate on the premise that there really be that this claim will spring back that there be some kind of reservation of right such that this claim would spring back and I be wonder why you think that where do you get that from i mean be this something that the party just a general understanding in this case that they we be dismiss it but that it would spring back if they win the appeal i guess i read your brief so i have largely buy into that assumption and if that we be true it do seem to me like you have an awfully good argument but it would not be final then under and i guess i be just ask why it be that your brief essentially you know for two third of the brief or more buy into that assumption whether there be something that i do not see or some general understanding that the party have that that suggest that assumption be the right one to make well do you think that should be something the the low court do not address that question and and that question seem at least in part dependent on fact that that that you would think the low court might have some good view on than we do would that suggest a remand on that question there be no discovery here so just out of curiosity I be sorry and what criterion do they use but what do they really use do they you know basically take a peek at the merit what do they do just before the so there there be this one case that suggest that that be what would happen i mean be this a procedure that be use in the ninth circuit what be it use for why do people think that this be the govern law could could i take you back sorry just to this sort of nonreservation reservation point you say there we be two thing that you do that fit with the ninth circuit s procedure you say it be not settle and you say that you we be go to appeal be that right right so where where do those requirement come from you know if i look at what case would i find that that be what you have to do in order to prejudice in order to dismiss something with prejudice in such a way that it spring back to life if you win the appeal ,138.37,Roberts Court,"Mar 21, 2017",Microsoft Corporation,"Seth Baker, et al.",15-457,"Jan 15, 2016","Jun 12, 2017",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2016,Shaw v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"So, Ms. Bell, I guess -- I guess what Justice Kennedy is suggesting and maybe I'm confused about the same thing, it now seems to me that there's no difference between your view and the government's view. So, Mr. Yang, I'm putting you on notice that this is a question to you too, because both of you are saying, look, there needs to be an intent to deceive the bank. And there needs to be an intent to deprive the bank of some form of property interest, but with the recognition that property interests includes possessory interests, as well as more classic ownership interests. And you agree with that. I'm going to think, and Mr. Yang you'll tell me, that Mr. Yang would agree with that too. So what are we fighting about? Then it's just -- Mr. Yang would say, well, look, a bank has a possessory interest in assets that are part of its depositor's account, and so, you know, that's -- whether you target the depositor's account or you target something else, you're still manifesting the same intent to deprive the bank of a property including possessory interest. That seems right to me. I want to point, you know, that you might say all of that is right and that the government and you agree, and what you really disagree on is whether these instructions reflected that correct understanding of the law. And that seems fair to me. And we should talk about the instructions. But it seems to me that the understanding of the law is now you are in perfect harmony. I think it -- But it -- Which you -- which you now include can include possessory interests. No. Most of them don't care. Ms. Bell, I think your answer is, no, Your Honor, because the instructions don't reflect your understanding of the law. I'm not saying it does. I think it's a hard question as to whether the instructions do or don't, but it does seem to me you have an argument about the instructions. Well, not just the heading, but analysis in that part C as well. I mean, the part C just seems to contradict part A or B or whichever it was. If you really mean an intent to deceive is not enough, that you need something about to deprive the bank of its property interest. Yes, so it seems to me, Mr. Yang, that the real disagreement that you have is that Ms. Bell wants to equate and intends to deprive a bank of a property interest with an intent to have a bank suffer a pecuniary loss in the end. She says those are the same things. You say they're different things. Let's assume you're right. Let's assume that that's -- that whether the bank in the end suffers a monetary loss is utterly irrelevant to the form of intent that's required by this statute. All right? So you won that one, let's say. Go back to the Chief Justice's question about how these instructions reflect that there needs to be an intent to deprive the bank of a posessory interest in property. I thought I was giving you them. Say, Mr. Yang, the instructions. They're kind of right. It doesn't -- it doesn't parse neatly under either reading. But I have to say that if I'm a reader, the way I understand this is you have to -- you have to show -- the scheme has to be one to deceive a bank, to cheat a bank or to deprive a bank of something of value. And in that case, the ""deceive a bank"" is operating as a disjunctive clause without the ""of something of value."" It's to deceive a bank alone, cheat a bank alone, or deprive a bank of something of value. And so I'm a juror. I say, well, it's enough if the bank was deceived. No, it's got to be that you're deceiving somebody. Well, I don't think so because that would make no sense. It would be the scheme must be one to deceive a bank of something of value. Whoever would use words like that? Well, I think it's more than grammatical. It's just -- like, it doesn't make sense. I quoted you it was, that it's an -- it's an intent to deprive the bank of a property, including a possessory interest. Yes. But the bank -- the bank has to have a possessory interest in -- a property interest in this thing. Mr. Yang, you referred to us, money in a security deposit. Your answer would be the same, right -- -- if -- if somebody went in and said, I'd like to see the security deposit boxes, and -- and made a false statement to the bank about his entitlement to see the security deposit boxes and took the money out? Doesn't -- you know, the bank still has a possessory interest in that, even though it doesn't use that money in the same way; is that correct? Let me give you another example. Suppose that I'm sitting in a coffee shop and somebody comes up to me and says, I have to make a phone call; would you just hang on to my computer for a minute? And then disappears, and then somebody else comes up, the fraudster comes up, and says, oh, she just told me to pick up her computer from her -- -- and that's a misrepresentation. But I give him the computer. Do I -- have I had a possessory interest in that computer just because somebody said, why don't you take a look, you know -- you know -- keep -- keep your eye on this? Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I mean -- What you're essentially saying is that anything I can think of, any hypothetical I can think of which involves my hanging on to something for somebody else, that I have a possessory interest in that sufficient to satisfy this scheme. I mean, that suggests to me that as long as the person knows that the money is being -- is in the bank somehow, it just shouldn't matter, because anything counts as a possessory interest, right? ",so ms bell i guess i guess what justice kennedy be suggest and maybe I be confuse about the same thing it now seem to me that there be no difference between your view and the government s view so mr yang I be put you on notice that this be a question to you too because both of you be say look there need to be an intent to deceive the bank and there need to be an intent to deprive the bank of some form of property interest but with the recognition that property interest include possessory interest as well as more classic ownership interest and you agree with that I be go to think and mr yang

bank in the end suffer a monetary loss be utterly irrelevant to the form of intent that be require by this statute all right so you win that one let us say go back to the chief justice s question about how these instruction reflect that there need to be an intent to deprive the bank of a posessory interest in property i think i be give you them say mr yang the instruction they be kind of right it do not it do not parse neatly under either reading but i have to say that if I be a reader the way i understand this be you have to you have to show the scheme have to be one to deceive a bank to

2016,Maslenjak v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"Yeah -- please, finish. Can I ask you, Mr. Landau -- -- about a -- a different interpretation of the statute. Neither you nor the government supports it, but it's raised briefly in the government's -- in footnote 4 of the government's brief, which is this idea that what we really should be doing here is we should be interpreting 1425 in exactly the same way that we interpret the civil statute, 1451, which talks about illegally procuring something. And that both are limited to failures to satisfy the prerequisites to naturalization. And that's really what we should be thinking about when we interpret that. And that would, in this case, presumably, be because of bad character; is that right? Mr. Parker? Please, I'm sorry. Finish up. Okay. But isn't -- And you'll be glad to know I don't have another of these questions for you. (Laughter.) Although I am a little bit horrified to know that every time I lie about my weight, it has those kinds of consequences. (Laughter.) Yeah. Can I just ask you -- can I ask you to take you through a few parts of your brief? Because I guess I felt a little bit confused on reading what your standard is. So on page 14, you say that the question is whether Petitioner violated the law in the course of procuring naturalization, in the course of procuring naturalization. Then on page 9 and page 17, you say that the question is whether a person procures naturalization in a manner that violates very -- that violates other laws. Which are we talking about? Is it in the course of or in a manner that violates other laws? Yeah. I mean, it seems sort of different to me. ""In the course of"" is what creates the hypotheticals that Justice Breyer was talking about, about the penknife or the gun or something like that. But what -- so what you're saying -- but we -- you -- I can just choose, you -- you can tell me, your standard is in a manner that violates other laws. Okay. So then -- I mean, it makes me want to say, okay, what does it mean to procure naturalization in the manner that violates other laws. And then you talk about that. And you talk about that on -- this -- the -- this is the only time I found in the brief where you actually suggest what it means to procure naturalization in a way that -- in a manner that violates other laws. And you say on page 18, what that means is by violating those various laws. By violating those various laws. And that made me think that's a causal requirement. You procure naturalization -- this is, again, on page 18 -- a person who knowingly procures naturalization in an unlawful manner, and then you clarify that that means by violating the laws Congress has enacted. So when you say that you procure naturalization by violating laws Congress has enacted, all you're saying is that -- is that the naturalization results from the violation of those laws. And I guess if that's not what you meant to say -- and I don't mean to trick you here -- -- if that's not what you meant to say in this brief, although it suggests -- it -- it -- I think it is what you say, but if it's not what you meant to say, well, how could it be anything else? Well, number one, where is that in the statute? But it doesn't say the statute. It just says contrary to law. It doesn't say what laws. It doesn't say laws governing the naturalization process. So that's -- that's one issue. But -- but that's a different issue from the one I'm talking about. Whatever laws it is, whether it's all laws or whether it's laws relating to the naturalization process. When you describe what you mean when you say in a manner that violates the laws, it's when you say, you say it's by -- you -- you procure naturalization by violating the laws, you very naturally -- I think it's a totally naturally -- natural -- -- construction of the language, you very naturally say you got the naturalization by violating those laws, meaning that the naturalization is the result of those -- that violation. Because what else could you mean when you say -- when you -- when you have a naturalization and you have these violation of laws? Again, that the violation led to the naturalization. I know. I'm sort of suggesting that in trying to describe that you ended up using the Petitioner's formulation, and that seems quite natural to me because I don't know what other formulation you could use -- -- to describe what it means and say in a manner that violates those laws. That's such a shorter statement of my question. It's perfect. (Laughter.) Well, Mr. Parker, let me -- let me try this another way. If you take this phrase, which is a kind of a stilted phrase, because the ""contrary to law"" comes in between. But -- but it -- all it really means is procure naturalization illegally. Do you agree with that? Procure contrary to law and naturalization, it's procure naturalization -- So the idea that procuring naturalization illegally somehow includes illegal acts that have no effect on naturalization, or on procuring naturalization, it's -- it's just not how we use language. How could it be that that is true? But it has -- but it has no effect on the decision to naturalize. Yes. And I guess what I'm saying is that, how do you use that phrase in a statute and not mean that there has to be a relationship between the illegal acts and the procurement of naturalization? Is -- is that the false statement for the purpose of obtaining an immigration benefit? Okay. ",yeah please finish can i ask you mr landau about a a different interpretation of the statute neither you nor the government support it but it be raise briefly in the government s in footnote of the government s brief which be this idea that what we really should be do here be we should be interpret in exactly the same way that we interpret the civil statute which talk about illegally procure something and that both be limit to failure to satisfy the prerequisite to naturalization and that be really what we should be think about when we interpret that and that would in this case presumably be because of bad character be that right mr parker please I be sorry finish up okay but be not and you will be glad to know i do not have another of these question for you laughter although i be a little bit horrify to know that every time i lie about my weight it have those kind of consequence laughter yeah can i just ask you can i ask you to take you through a few part of your brief because i guess i felt a little bit confuse on read what your standard be so on page you say that the question be whether petitioner violate the law in the course of procure naturalization in the course of procure naturalization then on page and page you say that the question be whether a person procure naturalization in a manner that violate very that violate other law which be we talk about be it in the course of or in a manner that violate other law yeah i mean it seem sort of different to me in the course of be what create the hypothetical that justice breyer be talk about about the penknife or the gun or something like that but what so what you be say but we you i can just choose you you can tell me your standard be in a manner that violate other law okay so then i mean it make me want to say okay what do it mean to procure naturalization in the manner that violate other law and then you talk about that and you talk about that on this the this be the only time i find in the brief where you actually suggest what it mean to procure naturalization in a way that in a manner that violate other law and you say on page what that mean be by violate those various law by violate those various law and that make me think that be a causal requirement you procure naturalization this be again on page a person who knowingly procure naturalization in an unlawful manner and then you clarify that that mean by violate the law congress have enact so when you say that you procure naturalization by violate law congress have enact all you be say be that be that the naturalization result from the violation of those law and i guess if that be not what you mean to say and i do not mean to trick you here if that be not what you mean to say in this brief although it suggest it it i think it be what you say but if it be not what you mean to say well how could it be anything else well number one where be that in the statute but it do not say the statute it just say contrary to law it do not say what law it do not say law govern the naturalization process so that be that be one issue but but that be a different issue from the one I be talk about whatever law it be whether it be all law or whether it be law relate to the naturalization process when you describe what you mean when you say in a manner that violate the law it be when you say you say it be by you you procure naturalization by violate the law you very naturally i think it be a totally naturally natural construction of the language you very naturally say you get the naturalization by violate those law meaning that the naturalization be the result of those that violation because what else could you mean when you say when you when you have a naturalization and you have these violation of law again that the violation lead to the naturalization i know I be sort of suggest that in try to describe that you end up use the petitioner s formulation and that seem quite natural to me because i do not know what other formulation you could use to describe what it mean and say in a manner that violate those law that be such a short statement of my question it be perfect laughter well mr parker let me let me try this another way if you take this phrase which be a kind of a stilted phrase because the contrary to law come in between but but it all it really mean be procure naturalization illegally do you agree with that procure contrary to law and naturalization it be procure naturalization so the idea that procure naturalization illegally somehow include illegal act that have no effect on naturalization or on procure naturalization it be it be just not how we use language how could it be that that be true but it have but it have no effect on the decision to naturalize yes and i guess what I be say be that how do you use that phrase in a statute and not mean that there have to be a relationship between the illegal act and the procurement of naturalization be be that the false statement for the purpose of obtain an immigration benefit okay ,348.32,Roberts Court,"Apr 26, 2017",Divna Maslenjak,United States,16-309,"Jan 13, 2017","Jun 22, 2017",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2016,Perry v. Merit Systems Protection Board,114,Elena Kagan,"But say -- say you exhaust in the agency EEO. Do you still have your civil service claims that you can bring in district court? The government says not, but it doesn't cite anything when it says not. You -- you're being generous to the government, Mr. Landau. The government says that it's only by regulation that they will toll the discrimination claim and that they could get rid of that regulation tomorrow. And then the discrimination claim would not be tolled, and you could run out of time on it; isn't that right? Well, that's what -- That's what the -- the Board says, but we don't know that, right? Isn't it for the district court to make exactly that determination? He still -- he still thinks he has civil service claims, in addition to discrimination claims. Well, that's because the Board didn't -- said that it was not reviewing the merits of his civil service claims. But he still thinks he has civil service claims and discrimination claims, and so he is rejecting the idea that the Board -- the Board has said it's not a mixed case, but he think it's still a mixed case. And the question is, who decides that? Because if it is a mixed case -- yes. It's going to go back to the -- to the district court, eventually. So I don't see that, Mr. Fletcher, as addressed by this statutory language that you talk about. You know, you talk about 7702, and as Justice Alito said, you said (a) says, ""has been affected,"" and (b) says -- alleges that a basis for the action was discrimination. But all 7702 does, is it defines a category of cases, these mixed cases, and that's what defines them, that it -- that the employee has been affected by a certain kind of action and makes a certain kind of allegation and it says, well, the Board decides that. And then 7703 says that, afterwards, it goes to the district court. But what is left completely unaddressed in this is the question of who decides whether this is a mixed case as defined by 7702. 7702 doesn't tell you that. It's a -- it's a -- so -- so where in the statute do you think it tells you who decides whether something is a mixed case as defined by 7702? I'm just asking you -- you know, you point to this language. This language doesn't get you there. I'm just asking whether you have other language to point to that suggests that the ""who decides"" question ought to be in the Federal Circuit. No, it obviously -- No, it obviously makes a distinction between allegations and -- and being affected by an action, but only -- all that this provision does is it defines what a mixed case is, and says the -- the Merit System Protection Board will decide that mixed case. And the definition of a mixed case has one element, which is an actual thing, and another element, which is an allegation. But this is only the statement that the Board will address mixed cases. It doesn't say anything about what happens if there's a dispute as to whether there is a mixed case, who gets to decide that question. But that's -- But the whole point of this scheme, generally -- and we have said this, and it appears on the face of the statute -- is to make sure that the employee doesn't have to claim-split. And so we've said when the Board dismisses your claim on the merits, you can take it to the district court. And we have said that when it dismisses your case on procedure, you can take it to the district court. You can do everything in the district court, you don't have to split it up, do one thing in the Federal Circuit and one thing in the district court. And now, for this one category of thing, which you call ""jurisdictional,"" Mr. Landau says in this case it looks an awful lot like a merits determination, but anyway, for this one category of thing, we're going to treat it differently, we're going to insist that you split your claims and -- and not bring the discrimination claim in the Federal Circuit because you can't bring it there, but instead you have to go to the Federal Circuit on your CSRA claim. Well, the claim -- it's temporary claims-splitting. It's -- you know, you have to put your -- your discrimination claim on the back burner and proceed with respect only to your civil service claim and decide, you know, whether the -- the board can -- can review that or not. That's a kind of claim-splitting. I mean, you can say eventually it will all get into the same place, but eventually can be can be a long time. And as I said before, your discrimination claim may have lapsed by then, and you don't guarantee that it will survive. And so that seems to me something which is -- is -- you know, really cuts against the way this scheme works in the vast majority of cases, and the way we have said it should. Then why -- Well, Kloeckner certainly says it, but beyond Kloeckner, I mean, merits cases that -- that have been -- have been going to district court for years prior to Kloeckner; isn't that right? Right. This would be a kind of revolution, I mean, in -- in -- to the extent that you can have a revolution in this kind of case. (Laughter.) So but -- -- the question, Mr. Fletcher, is a contested one. Do you think he has to ask that? Suppose he asked something else. Suppose he said, I'd like the district court just to decide this. Could he do that? There are times where the district court does it without the Board's doing it first, right? When the Board -- when the time period lapses? ",but say say you exhaust in the agency eeo do you still have your civil service claim that you can bring in district court the government say not but it do not cite anything when it say not you you be be generous to the government mr landau the government say that it be only by regulation that they will toll the discrimination claim and that they could get rid of that regulation tomorrow and then the discrimination claim would not be toll and you could run out of time on it be not that right well that be what that be what the the board say but we do not know that right be not it for the district court to make exactly that determination he still he still think he have civil service claim in addition to discrimination claim well that be because the board do not say that it be not review the merit of his civil service claim but he still think he have civil service claim and discrimination claim and so he be reject the idea that the board the board have say it be not a mixed case but he think it have still a mixed case and the question be who decide that because if it be a mixed case yes it be go to go back to the to the district court eventually so i do not see that mr fletcher as address by this statutory language that you talk about you know you talk about and as justice alito say you say a say have be affect and b say allege that a basis for the action be discrimination but all do be it define a category of case these mixed case and that be what define them that it that the employee have be affect by a certain kind of action and make a certain kind of allegation and it say well the board decide that and then say that afterwards it go to the district court but what be leave completely unaddressed in this be the question of who decide whether this be a mixed case as define by do not tell you that it be a it be a so so where in the statute do you think it tell you who decide whether something be a mixed case as define by I be just ask you you know you point to this language this language do not get you there I be just ask whether you have other language to point to that suggest that the who decide question ought to be in the federal circuit no it obviously no it obviously make a distinction between allegation and and be affect by an action but only all that this provision do be it define what a mixed case be and say the the merit system protection board will decide that mixed case and the definition of a mixed case have one element which be an actual thing and another element which be an allegation but this be only the statement that the board will address mixed case it do not say anything about what happen if there be a dispute as to whether there be a mixed case who get to decide that question but that be but the whole point of this scheme generally and we have say this and it appear on the face of the statute be to make sure that the employee do not have to claim split and so we have say when the board dismiss your claim on the merit you can take it to the district court and we have say that when it dismiss your case on procedure you can take it to the district court you can do everything in the district court you do not have to split it up do one thing in the federal circuit and one thing in the district court and now for this one category of thing which you call jurisdictional mr landau say in this case it look an awful lot like a merit determination but anyway for this one category of thing we be go to treat it differently we be go to insist that you split your claim and and not bring the discrimination claim in the federal circuit because you can not bring it there but instead you have to go to the federal circuit on your csra claim well the claim it be temporary claim splitting it be you know you have to put your your discrimination claim on the back burner and proceed with respect only to your civil service claim and decide you know whether the the board can can review that or not that be a kind of claim splitting i mean you can say eventually it will all get into the same place but eventually can be can be a long time and as i say before your discrimination claim may have lapse by then and you do not guarantee that it will survive and so that seem to me something which be be you know really cut against the way this scheme work in the vast majority of case and the way we have say it should then why well kloeckner certainly say it but beyond kloeckner i mean merit case that that have be have be go to district court for year prior to kloeckner be not that right right this would be a kind of revolution i mean in in to the extent that you can have a revolution in this kind of case laughter so but the question mr fletcher be a contested one do you think he have to ask that suppose he ask something else suppose he say I would like the district court just to decide this could he do that there be time where the district court do it without the board s do it first right when the board when the time period lapse ,320.95,Roberts Court,"Apr 17, 2017",Anthony W.

2016,Life Technologies Corp. v. Promega Corp.,114,Elena Kagan,"Where -- where do you get that from? What's the principle there? Well, how do we know that that's all Congress wanted to do? I mean, that might have been the -- the -- the scenario in Deepsouth, but Congress used language that could refer to much more than that, that could refer to a majority, that even could refer to a substantial minority. Well, I'm not sure if that's -- I'm not sure if that's true, Mr. Phillips. I mean, you're reading (f)(2) as having a negative implication, that this is the only time when one component can create liability, is when it's especially made or especially adapted. But these might be just independent clauses. In other words, (f)(2) talks about a component that's especially made, whether or not it's a substantial portion of the product. And then (f)(1) comes in and says -- independently creates a rule for a component or components that are a substantial portion of the product. So I'm not sure why we have to read (f)(2) as creating this negative implication as to any product, any single product, as opposed to just saying (f)(2) is about specially made stuff, and it has nothing to do with (f)(1), which is not about specially made stuff, and provides a different test about substantial -- substantiality. Because there's a reason why it's that almost all. I mean, if I said to you, Mr. Tripp, a substantial portion of my former clerks have gone into government work, how many would I mean? So you're not pinning this on the -- on the language here, the substantial portion means almost all? You are finding it from someplace else? And where are you finding it from?

2016,"Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer",114,Elena Kagan,"But -- So do you think, Mr. Cortman, suppose there was an application and a -- from a -- a church that used its playground for religious activities. Had prayer services there, for example. Could the State, in your view, deny the money on that ground, or at least would you think that that was a significantly different case? That they -- I'm sorry. They don't think they should -- How would you -- for example, one of the things that the Court has -- has thought about in the past is like computers for education. So I guess somebody could make the same argument about computers. Well, it doesn't really -- it's separate from the religious instruction that might be carried out over those computers. Do you think that that's the same, or is it different? Would you say -- Well, I'm sorry -- Mr. Cortman, my questions about religious uses, I think, was to get at a -- a broader point, a broader distinction, and asked -- ask what you think of it. And as it seems that you are on strongest ground when you say, look, the State has decided to fund some activity, and it's denying that -- that funding to a particular party based solely on that party's religious status. And that's the way you briefed the case. I hear you making a different argument, or a broader argument now, that extends into a State's decision to deny some uses -- to deny funding to some uses at the same time as it gives funding to other uses, and a State's decision to say, look, we really just don't want to fund religious exercise. They can do religious exercise. We don't want to fund religious exercise. And I understand that you might think that's out of bounds, too. But what I'm trying to figure out is, is there a distinction between these two things. Okay. So you don't disagree with that. But the State is entitled to say you can't use this money for religious activity, and maybe I'll bring you a little bit further, we're entitled to take certain prophylactic measures to make sure that you don't use the money for religious activity. Well, then how about the -- May I take you back to the substance, Mr. Cortman, unless anybody -- it's -- let's talk a little bit about federalism, and here's what I would like to know. You know, usually when we see these funding cases, it comes in a different context. It comes where the State wants to give money and somebody is objecting. And this case comes in the converse way, where a State says we just don't want to fund -- -- this institution. And these -- these church/States divide, it's a -- it's a fraught issue. It's a hard issue. It's a -- it's an issue in which States have their own very longstanding law. It's an issue on which I -- I guess I'm going to say nobody is completely sure that they have it right. And -- and so I guess there's something attractive about having some play in the joints where States can go their own way and make their own choices. And why shouldn't this be one of those cases? Well, that's, of course, true, that if there's a -- a constitutional right at stake, that trumps. But the question is, how are we going to interpret the constitutional right? What are we -- so -- so I guess what I'm asking is, do you see value in the other side in having some flexibility here for States to make these sorts of choices? But one last -- I know your white light is on. But might the State think that here's the problem. The problem is this church has come in with a very competitive application. We want to give money to this church. Let's say, you know, a Protestant church. There's a Catholic church across the street. Catholic church applies, doesn't get money, this happens five years running. And people start thinking, well, why is the Protestant church keeping on getting the money and the Catholic church never gets the money? And the State says, we just won't -- don't want to sow that kind of division, that kind of mistrust, that kind of -- well, that -- Mr. Layton -- Mr. Layton, could we go back to where Justice Alito started -- -- and -- and you said no money to churches. Why can the State provide police protection or fire protection? Mr. Layton, I understand that -- So, Mr. Layton, let's say I -- I accept that the State might have an interest in saying we just don't want to be seen as giving money to one church and not another in these selective programs. I -- I think that that's legitimate. But here's the thing. There's a constitutional principle. It's as strong as any constitutional principle that there is, that when we have a program of funding -- and here we're funding playground surfaces -- that everybody is entitled to that funding, to -- to that particular funding, whether or not they exercise a constitutional right; in other words, here, whether or not they are a religious institution doing religious things. As long as you're using the money for playground services, you're not disentitled from that program because you're a religious institution doing religious things. And I would have thought that that's a pretty strong principle in our constitutional law. And how is that the State says that that's not violated here? I think -- But here's the deal. You're right that this is a selective program. It's not a general program in which everybody gets money. But still the question is whether some people can be disentitled from applying to that program and from receiving that money if they are qualified based on other completely nonreligious attributes, and they're disqualified solely because they are a religious institution doing religious things. Even though they're not -- they could -- they could promise you, we're not going to do religious things on this playground surface, and you're still saying, well, no, you -- you can't get the money. But I don't understand -- I -- I think I understand how the States' interests might differ some, but essentially this is a program open to everyone. Happens to be a competitive program, but everyone is open to compete on various neutral terms, and you're depriving one set of actors from being able to compete in the same way everybody else can compete because of their religious identification. Yes. And those are interests. I don't mean to say that those are not valid interests. But it does seem as though this is a clear burden -- looked at that way, this is a clear burden on a constitutional right. And then your interests have to rise to an extremely high level. It's a burden on constitutional right, in other words, because people of a certain religious status are being prevented from competing in the same way everybody else is for a neutral benefit. ",but so do you think mr cortman suppose there be an application and a from a a church that use its playground for religious activity have prayer service there for example could the state in your view deny the money on that ground or at least would you think that that be a significantly different case that they I be sorry they do not think they should how would you for example one of the thing that the court have have think about in the past be like computer for education so i guess somebody could make the same argument about computer well it do not really it be separate from the religious instruction that might be carry out over those computer do you think that that be the same or be it different would you say well I be sorry mr cortman my question about religious us i think be to get at a a broad point a broad distinction and ask ask what you think of it and as it seem that you be on strong ground when you say look the state have decide to fund some activity and it be deny that that funding to a particular party base solely on that party s religious status and that be the way you brief the case i hear you make a different argument or a broad argument now that extend into a state s decision to deny some us to deny funding to some us at the same time as it give fund to other us and a state s decision to say look we really just do not want to fund religious exercise they can do religious exercise we do not want to fund religious exercise and i understand that you might think that be out of bound too but what I be try to figure out be be there a distinction between these two thing okay so you do not disagree with that but the state be entitle to say you can not use this money for religious activity and maybe I will bring you a little bit further we be entitle to take certain prophylactic measure to make sure that you do not use the money for religious activity well then how about the may i take you back to the substance mr cortman unless anybody it be let us talk a little bit about federalism and here s what i would like to know you know usually when we see these funding case it come in a different context it come where the state want to give money and somebody be object and this case come in the converse way where a state say we just do not want to fund this institution and these these churchstates divide it be a it be a fraught issue it be a hard

if there be a a constitutional right at stake that trump but the question be how be we go to interpret the constitutional right what be we so so i guess what I be ask be do you see value in the other

2016,Manuel v. City of Joliet,114,Elena Kagan,"You would be in. I wasn't sure.  I that you were arguing. A claim for detention. Now, what the statute limitations is on that claim or what the accrual period is on that claim is something that we don't have to decide in order to say, yes, you have a claim under the Constitution for improper detention. Mr. Scodro, I -- I just to say I read this differently, so you can tell me why I'm wrong. But I'm -- in the last column of the Seventh Circuit's opinion, so there are twice where the Seventh Circuit says what it thinks.  The first time it says, when after the arrest a particular person is not let go when he should be -- so it's after the initial seizure, and then the person is not let go, the Fourth Amendment gives way to the due process clause as a basis for challenging his detention. And then in the last paragraph it says, ""Once detention by reason of arrest turns into detention by reason of arraignment, the Fourth Amendment falls out of the picture."" So it seems to me that twice, the Seventh Circuit says very clearly that you have this Fourth Amendment claim until arraignment or legal process, and after that, the Fourth Amendment falls out of the picture. And at the very basic level, before you get into these questions of what's the accrual date or anything else, it seems that that's the thing that the Petitioner is saying is wrong, that the Fourth Amendment claim continues after arraignment or after legal process.  Now, when it accrues, when it doesn't accrue is a different question, but it's still a Fourth Amendment claim, and -- and -- and that's what the Seventh Circuit rejected. Mr. Scodro, can I ask -- might be misunderstanding this, so you'll tell me if I am.  But it seems as though the position that you're taking now is diametrically opposed to the position that you took in the Seventh Circuit.  So I'll just read you something, and this is from oral argument, but my clerk tells me that this is what happened.  I think it is not a transcript, but maybe there is.  But at least this is what my clerk tells me happened at oral argument. Judge Rovner says there are ten other circuits that have now recognized this kind of claim, this kind of Fourth Amendment claim.  And she said, let's just assume that we do what those ten other circuits have done, which, of course, they didn't do, but she says let's just assume it. At what point would you think the statute of limitations would begin to run?  And then you -- or maybe not you, but you -- (Laughter.) You say, well, if you to recognize such a claim -- -- the accrual is the at which the proceedings are terminated in favor of that individual. So in this case it would be -- I think the date would have been May 4, 2011. And then Chief Judge Woods says, so you're assuming that the constitutional tort would follow the same pattern that State law does and require the favorable termination, because if there's no favorable termination for all the policy reasons the States have considered, there's no injury. And again, whoever the lawyer was said, that's correct. So am I misunderstanding this, or are you saying that's not correct; that's wrong? Is there no transcript this? Oh, I don't think that's -- I mean, maybe, I guess.  I mean, it seems to me that the much more natural way of understanding this is to say, look, if we do what every other circuit has done in the sense that we acknowledge that there is a Fourth Amendment claim here, post-legal process, something which you yourself have now acknowledged today, that if we acknowledge that, what would the accrual date be?  And then the lawyer says the accrual date would be the date of termination. And -- and now you're it wouldn't be.  And I actually don't know whether it should be or it shouldn't be.  I don't think the Seventh Circuit for a moment considered that question.  And I guess it's -- it's another reason why I think we should just send the whole thing back.  The Seventh Circuit can figure out whether you forfeited this claim.  The Seventh Circuit can figure out, if you didn't forfeit this claim, what the right answer is.  But to me, this language -- and I have not listened to the tape myself, so I have to admit that -- but to me, this language suggests that you forfeited this. ",you would be in i be not sure i that you we be argue a claim for detention now what the statute limitation be on that claim or what the accrual period be on that claim be something that we do not have to decide in order to say yes you have a claim under the constitution for improper detention mr scodro i i just to say i read this differently so you can tell me why I be wrong but I be in the last column of the seventh circuit s opinion so there be twice where the seventh circuit say what it think the first time it say when after the arrest a particular person be not let go when he should be so it be after the initial seizure and then the person be not let go the fourth amendment give way to the due process clause as a basis for challenge his detention and then in the last paragraph it say once detention by reason of arrest turn into detention by reason of arraignment the fourth amendment fall out of the picture so it seem to me that twice the seventh circuit say very clearly that you have this fourth amendment claim until arraignment or legal process and after that the fourth amendment fall out of the picture and at the very basic level before you get into these question of what be the accrual date or anything else it seem that that be the thing that the petitioner be say be wrong that the fourth amendment claim continue after arraignment or after legal process now when it accrue when it do not accrue be a different question but it be still a fourth amendment claim and and and that be what the seventh circuit reject mr scodro can i ask might be misunderstand this so you will tell me if i be but it seem as though the position that you be take now be diametrically oppose to the position that you take in the seventh circuit so I will just read you something and this be from oral argument but my clerk tell me that this be what happen i think it be not a transcript but maybe there be but at least this be what my clerk tell me happen at oral argument judge rovner say there be ten other circuit that have now recognize this kind of claim this kind of fourth amendment claim and she say let us just assume that we do what those ten other circuit have do which of course they do not do but she say let us just assume it at what point would you think the statute of limitation would begin to run and then you or maybe not you but you laughter you say well if you to recognize such a claim the accrual be the at which the proceeding be terminate in favor of that individual so in this case it would be i think the date would have be may and then chief judge wood say so you be assume that the constitutional tort would follow the same pattern that state law do and require the favorable termination because if there be no favorable termination for all the policy reason the state have consider there be no injury and again whoever the lawyer be say that be correct so be i misunderstanding this or be you say that be not correct that be wrong be there no transcript this oh i do not think that be i mean maybe i guess i mean it seem to me that the much more natural way of understand this be to say look if we do what every other circuit have do in the sense that we acknowledge that there be a fourth amendment claim here post legal process something which you yourself have now acknowledge today that if we acknowledge that what would the accrual date be and then the lawyer say the accrual date would be the date of termination and and now you be it would not be and i actually do not know whether it should be or it should not be i do not think the seventh circuit for a moment consider that question and i guess it be it be another reason why i think we should just send the whole thing back the seventh circuit can figure out whether you forfeit this claim the seventh circuit can figure out if you do not forfeit this claim what the right answer be but to me this language and i have not listen to the tape myself so i have to admit that but to me this language suggest that you forfeit this ,259.94000000000005,Roberts Court,"Oct 5, 2016",Elijah Manuel,"City of Joliet, Illinois, et al.",14-9496,"Jan 15, 2016","Mar 21, 2017",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2016,Matal v. Tam,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Stewart, please. Assume government speech itself is not involved. I always thought that government programs were subject to one extremely important constraint, which is that they can't make distinctions based on viewpoint. So why isn't this doing exactly that? Yes. Well, that's absolutely true. It -- it precludes disparagement of Democrats and Republicans alike, and so forth and so on, but it makes a very important distinction, which is that you can say good things about some person or group, but you can't say bad things about some person or group. So, for example, let's say that I wanted a mark that expressed the idea that all politicians are corrupt, or just that Democrats are corrupt. Either way, it doesn't matter. I couldn't get that mark, even though I could get a mark saying that all politicians are virtuous, or that all Democrats are virtuous. Either way, it doesn't matter. You see the point. The point is that I can say good things about something, but I can't say bad things about something. And I would have thought that that was a fairly classic case of viewpoint discrimination. Well, that's libelism, one of our historically different, but very distinct categories. And you don't make the claim that this falls into a category of low value speech in the way that libel laws and the way that defamation does or fighting words or something like that. And you're not looking to create a new category. So in that case, it seems that the viewpoint-based ban applies, and -- and this -- as I said, I would be interested to hear your answer of why the example that I stated is not viewpoint-based. It says you can say something bad about -- you can say something good about somebody, but not something bad about somebody or something. But why isn't that this? No, no, no. That's -- it -- as I said, even in a government program, even assuming that this is not just a classic speech restriction, you're still subject to the constraint that you can't discriminate on -- on the basis of viewpoint. There are potential -- there are potential First Amendment problems, too, if the nature of the distinction was based on the person's speech; isn't that right? So absolutely clearly if it was based on viewpoint. And -- and so I guess I don't want to interrupt your answer to Justice Alito, if -- but I want to get back to -- because I don't really understand the answer that you gave me before. You said a government regulation that distinguished between saying politicians are good and virtuous and politicians are corrupt would clearly be viewpoint-based; is that right? So -- and similarly, if you said that the flag is a wonderful emblem, this -- this applies to national symbols -- -- but you could say that the flag is a wonderful emblem, but you can't say that the flag is a terrible emblem. That would be viewpoint-based. I mean, that's what this -- this regulation does. It says you can say one of those things, but you can't say the other and get trademark. But that's like saying it does so much viewpoint-based discrimination that it becomes all right. Yes, yes. And -- and I'm willing to give you that. But even government programs, again, assuming it's not government speech itself, even government programs are subject to this constraint, which is that you can't distinguish based on the viewpoint of a speaker. But why does that -- -- matter? I mean, maybe the government just decides we want to celebrate everything. We want to be relentlessly positive. (Laughter.) Can I -- Well, one of the things, Mr. Connell, that troubles me about this case is that it's not quite as simple as just saying, well, here's a government program and the government is discriminating on the basis of viewpoint, because there are aspects of this program that seem like government speech itself, maybe not quite that, but something approaching it, which is the program says that anything that's registered, the government publishes in its own publication. The government sends to foreign countries, again, in its own publication. So the whole program is geared in such a way that individual marks that are registered end up being -- I doubt anybody would ascribe them to the government, but the government republishes them, communicates them and so forth. And doesn't that aspect of the program give the government greater leeway here than it would in a typical program in which no government speech itself is involved? Well, Mr. Connell, this can't be right, because think of all the other things, the other -- I mean, I'll call them content distinctions because they are -- that trademark law just makes. I mean, Section 2 prohibits the registration of any mark that's falsely suggestive of a connection with persons likely to cause confusion, descriptive, misdescriptive, functional, a geographic indication for wine or spirits, government insignia, a living person's name, portrait, or signature. You couldn't make any of those distinctions in a -- in a -- in a public park, and yet, of course, you can make them in trademark law, can't you? Well, these might be viewpoint-neutral, but they're certainly not content-neutral, and yet we would -- I mean, I think that a challenge to many of these would fall flat. Because -- like, how is trademark law supposed to function unless it can make these kinds of distinctions? Well -- -- okay. If those would survive, then this is not a public park, because those would not survive in a public park. There's something different here, in other words, that this is coming up in the context of a government program -- -- which provides certain benefits that the government doesn't have to provide at all. ",mr stewart please assume government speech itself be not involve i always think that government program we be subject to one extremely important constraint which be that they can not make distinction base on viewpoint so why be not this do exactly that yes well that be absolutely true it it preclude disparagement of democrat and republican alike and so forth and so on but it make a very important distinction which be that you can say good thing about some person or group but you can not say bad thing about some person or group so for example let us say that i want a mark that express the idea that all politician be corrupt or just that democrat be corrupt either way it do not matter i could not get that mark even though i could get a mark say that all politician be virtuous or that all democrat be virtuous either way it do not matter you see the point the point be that i can say good thing about something but i can not say bad thing about something and i would have think that that be a fairly classic case of viewpoint discrimination well that be libelism one of our historically different but very distinct category and you do not make the claim that this fall into a category of low value speech in the way that libel law and the way that defamation do or fight word or something like that and you be not look to create a new category so in that case it seem that the viewpoint base ban applies and and this as i say i would be interested to hear your answer of why the example that i state be not viewpoint base it say you can say something bad about you can say something good about somebody but not something bad about somebody or something but why be not that this no no no that be it as i say even in a government program even assume that this be not just a classic speech restriction you be still subject to the constraint that you can not discriminate on on the basis of viewpoint there be potential there be potential first amendment problem too if the nature of the distinction be base on the person s speech be not that right so absolutely clearly if it be base on viewpoint and and so i guess i do not want to interrupt your answer to justice alito if but i want to get back to because i do not really understand the answer that you give me before you say a government regulation that distinguish between say politician be good and virtuous and politician be corrupt would clearly be viewpoint base be that right so and similarly if you say that the flag be a wonderful emblem this this apply to national symbol but you could say that the flag be a wonderful emblem but you can not say that the flag be a terrible emblem that would be viewpoint base i mean that be what this this regulation do it say you can say one of those thing but you can not say the other and get trademark but that be like say it do so much viewpoint base discrimination that it become all right yes yes and and I be willing to give you that but even government program again assume it be not government speech itself even government program be subject to this constraint which be that you can not distinguish base on the viewpoint of a speaker but why do that matter i mean maybe the government just decides we want to celebrate everything we want to be relentlessly positive laughter can i well one of the thing mr connell that trouble me about this case be that it be not quite as simple as just say well here s a government program and the government be discriminate on the basis of viewpoint because there be aspect of this program that seem like government speech itself maybe not quite that but something approach it which be the program say that anything that be register the government publish in its own publication the government send to foreign country again in its own publication so the whole program be gear in such a way that individual mark that be register end up be i doubt anybody would ascribe them to the government but the government republish them communicate them and so forth and do not that aspect of the program give the government great leeway here than it would in a typical program in which no government speech itself be involve well mr connell this can not be right because think of all the other thing the other i mean I will call them content distinction because they be that trademark law just make i mean section prohibit the registration of any mark that be falsely suggestive of a connection with person likely to because confusion descriptive misdescriptive functional a geographic indication for wine or spirit government insignia a live person s name portrait or signature you could not make any of those distinction in a in a in a public park and yet of course you can make them in trademark law can not you well these might be viewpoint neutral but they be certainly not content neutral and yet we would i mean i think that a challenge to many of these would fall flat because like how be trademark law suppose to function unless it can make these kind of distinction well okay if those would survive then this be not a public park because those would not survive in a public park there be something different here in other word that this be come up in the context of a government program which provide certain benefit that the government do not have to provide at all ,344.44000000000005,Roberts

2016,Davila v. Davis,114,Elena Kagan,"Could you respond to that first? Is that okay, Justice Sotomayor? Because -- because there is -- there's no right -- there's no need to have an appellate process, but once the State has given an appellate process, there is a right to have effective assistance of counsel on appeal. So that seems an important right. But in -- in most States it does apply; isn't that right? Yeah. Yeah. And then, General, I think that your brief did the right thing in terms of thinking about Martinez to say why did Martinez make the exception that it did and ask whether those same factors suggest an analogous exception here. I think that that's the right way to go about thinking about this question. So, I mean, it seems to me that your main theme here is this idea that you did get one shot; is -- is that -- is that correct? Yeah -- Okay. Okay. So the unique right, I mean, I think we've talked about. It's -- trial counsel, for sure, is the most, most, most important, but appellate counsel is pretty important too. But just let's think about this you -- you got one shot already. I guess I'm just not sure I understand it, because it seems to me what Martinez said is, you wouldn't -- you wouldn't get a shot to make your trial -- ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim, your IATC claim, and only if we made the exception that we did would you get a shot to make that trial counsel claim. And here, similarly, only if we do the same thing will you ever get a shot to make a claim that your appellate counsel was deficient. And people do have an independent, freestanding constitutional right to effective appellate counsel. I think if you read -- -- Martinez, Martinez basically does not talk at all about the underlying error. It talks about the ineffective assistance claim. Now, of course, ineffective assistance is important because, you know, it's not just the lawyers there for show, it's -- it's to remedy or prevent some underlying claim. But the same is true here. If Martinez was trying to figure out how to ensure the fairness of the trial process, this would be trying to figure out how to ensure, through effective counsel, the fairness of the appellate process. And it seems to me quite analogous, indeed identical -- -- just on a different level. But here -- but here it's an appellate error. But, again -- -- General, you're sort of -- -- redefining it so that it fits your position. But Martinez was about having some court evaluate the ineffective assistance of trial claim, and this is about having some court evaluate the ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim. And is there an underlying thing that we're trying to get at? Sure. In Martinez, it was ineffective assistance of trial counsel to ensure that the trial process was fair. Here, it's -- it's -- it's having some court litigate the ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim in order to ensure that the appellate counsel is fair. So the two are quite analogous. It -- it ends, I think -- you're exactly right. And I think it ends where the Constitution gives out. Because we've said that although the State does not have to set up an appeals process, once it sets up an appeals process, you are entitled to effective counsel in it. And so that's where it ends. Yes. And then there was Martinez. And as you said, in Martinez and in Trevino, we really went through the three factors that you talk about in your brief: How important is this? Is this the only shot? And, you know, does the State have something to do with this, or something. Is that the third one? And, you know, I'm -- I'm suggesting it's pretty important, and this is your only shot. But this claim -- -- is not about the underlying trial error. This claim is about effective assistance of appellate counsel. And -- and -- and that's about ensuring that the appellate process has integrity and fairness attached to it. But, General, that assumes that a -- that some court is going to say, if there was a trial error that we can see out there, then there was ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. But that's not correct for many of the reasons that people on -- I mean, that everybody acknowledges. To have ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, it's not because you failed to make an argument about any old trial error; it's going to be a special and rare thing. General, could I just -- I guess I got a little bit confused in your exchange with Justice Alito, because you had been pressing this is just going to be an infinitesimally small -- infinitesimally small, I think that that was your phrase. And Justice Alito said he thought it would happen all the time, and then you said yes, and then you went back to infinitesimally small. So, which is it? Right. Okay. I thought that his point was different, that it was actually not going to be infinitesimally small. But let's say that it is going to be pretty rare, as you say. You know, then I think it really is Justice Breyer's question. It's like, okay, it will be rare. But the alternative is that those rare, good claims, where there really has been a defective appellate process and a violation of the constitutional right to a fair appellate process has been violated, and there's no way to correct for that in the same way that there was no way to correct for the -- the trial -- the ineffective trial counsel that we talked about in Martinez and Trevino. It did reaffirm the general rule of Coleman except to the extent that this was your only shot. And this is your only shot to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, which is a violation of a constitutional right. That's all we're dealing with here. ",could you respond to that first be that okay justice sotomayor because because there be there be no right there have no need to have an appellate process but once the state have give an appellate process there be a right to have effective assistance of counsel on appeal so that seem an important right but in in most state it do apply be not that right yeah yeah and then general i think that your brief do the right thing in term of think about martinez to say why do martinez make the exception that it do and ask whether those same factor suggest an analogous exception here i think that that be the right way to go about think about this question so i mean it seem to me that your main theme here be this idea that you do get one shot be be that be that correct yeah okay okay so the unique right i mean i think we have talk about it be trial counsel for sure be the most most most important but appellate counsel be pretty important too but just let us think about this you you get one shot already i guess I be just not sure i understand it because it seem to me what martinez say be you would not you would not get a shot to make your trial ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim your iatc claim and only if we make the exception that we do would you get a shot to make that trial counsel claim and here similarly only if we do the same thing will you ever get a shot to make a claim that your appellate counsel be deficient and people do have an independent freestanding constitutional right to effective appellate counsel i think if you read martinez martinez basically do not talk at all about the underlying error it talk about the ineffective assistance claim now of course ineffective assistance be important because you know it be not just the lawyer there for show it be it be to remedy or prevent some underlying claim but the same be true here if martinez be try to figure out how to ensure the fairness of the trial process this would be try to figure out how to ensure through effective counsel the fairness of the appellate process and it seem to me quite analogous indeed identical just on a different level but here but here it be an appellate error but again general you be sort of redefine it so that it fit your position but martinez be about have some court evaluate the ineffective assistance of trial claim and this be about have some court evaluate the ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim and be there an underlying thing that we be try to get at sure in martinez it be ineffective assistance of trial counsel to ensure that the trial process be fair here it be it have it be have some court litigate the ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim in order to ensure that the appellate counsel be fair so the two be quite analogous it it end i think you be exactly right and i think it end where the constitution give out because we have say that although the state do not have to set up an appeal process once it set up an appeal process you be entitle to effective counsel in it and so that be where it end yes and then there be martinez and as you say in martinez and in trevino we really go through the three factor that you talk about in your brief how important be this be this the only shot and you know do the state have something to do with this or something be that the third one and you know I be I be suggest it be pretty important and this be your only shot but this claim be not about the underlying trial error this claim be about effective assistance of appellate counsel and and and that be about ensure that the appellate process have integrity and fairness attach to it but general that assume that a that some court be go to say if there be a trial error that we can see out there then there be ineffective assistance of appellate counsel but that be not correct for many of the reason that people on i mean that everybody acknowledge to have ineffective assistance of appellate counsel it be not because you fail to make an argument about any old trial error it be go to be a special and rare thing general could i just i guess i get a little bit confuse in your exchange with justice alito because you have be press this be just go to be an infinitesimally small infinitesimally small i think that that be your phrase and justice alito say he think it would happen all the time and then you say yes and then you go back to infinitesimally small so which be it right okay i think that his point be different that it be actually not go to be infinitesimally small but let us say that it be go to be pretty rare as you say you know then i think it really be justice breyer s question it be like okay it will be rare but the alternative be that those rare good claim where there really have be a defective appellate process and a violation of the constitutional right to a fair appellate process have be violate and there be no way to correct for that in the same way that there be no way to correct for the the trial the ineffective trial counsel that we talk about in martinez and trevino it do reaffirm the general rule of coleman except to the extent that this be your only shot and this be your only shot to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel which be a violation of a constitutional right that be all we be deal with here ,363.36999999999983,Roberts Court,"Apr

2016,Sessions v. Morales-Santana,114,Elena Kagan,"But why do we look, Mr. Kneedler, to the moment of birth? Why shouldn't we look to the moment when citizenship is sought? Why couldn't that have been done, Mr. Kneedler? Why couldn't these objectives have been served through entirely gender neutral language? For example, I know that there was a proposal that the Secretary of State made earlier than this statute was passed in the 1930s, which talked just about legal parents, which didn't refer to mothers and fathers at all. That would get rid of the gender inequality that is at the heart of his complaint. Whether or not he in the end benefits from it, the question here is whether the statute makes -- constitutes a violation of equal protection. One question we ask when we think about a question like that is, could Congress have written the statute? Could Congress have served its objectives in an entirely gender neutral way? And it seems as though here we have the -- the Secretary of State presented a statute to Congress that actually did that. Could I -- I'm sorry. Were you finished? Could I -- I mean, we generally have a rule that when we find an equal protection violation, we level up rather than level down. That's been the Court's consistent practice. Wouldn't you agree? Well, I find one compelling reason to do it -- and I just thought I'd offer this up to you and see what you have to say -- is that in this case, unlike in some cases, there really isn't a choice between leveling up and leveling down in one sense, because if you level down, this party gets no relief. In other words, you say, well, you level -- you just apply it prospectively. But then this party gets absolutely no relief. And so isn't that a problem? Isn't it the kind of the same problem as Justice Harlan recognized in -- in Welsh when he was dealing with a criminal matter? He said, you know, you can't level down because you can't give everybody the exact same benefit. So how do we deal with that? But not really a situation like this. Not a situation where we say, uh, there is an equal protection violation, and if we extend the benefit to everybody, we can take care of that equal protection violation, we can remedy the problem. But if we do not, if we try to level down, the effect of that is that the -- the party before us who has proved an equal protection violation gets absolutely no relief at all. I mean, the problem, isn't it, Mr. Broome, that the very inequality that you are complaining of would remain, because it's impossible to claw back everybody else's citizenship, so it's really impossible to level down. And the very inequality that we've just found would remain. But it's not just that it doesn't give you citizenship, it's that it doesn't cure the inequality at all. Either by leveling down or by leveling up. Mr. Kneedler -- But before you -- before you do that, Mr. Broome, just on the remedy question, very occasionally this Court has faced a situation when the natural remedy of something that it is holding. We were concerned a little bit about how -- whether Congress would prefer a different remedy. So, for example, in the Northern Pipeline case, what we did in a situation like that was we stayed our judgment for a period of time and allowed Congress essentially to do it a different way if it wanted to. And I'm wondering whether you had considered that possibility here, that we could order a kind of leveling-up judgment but stay it for some period of time so that Congress could decide whether it instead preferred some other way of dealing with the problem, whether that would be appropriate? ",but why do we look mr kneedler to the moment of birth why should not we look to the moment when citizenship be seek why could not that have be do mr kneedler why could not these objective have be serve through entirely gender neutral language for example i know that there be a proposal that the secretary of state make earlier than this statute be pass in the s which talk just about legal parent which do not refer to mother and father at all that would get rid of the gender inequality that be at the heart of his complaint whether or not he in the end benefit from it the question here be whether the statute make constitute a violation of equal protection one question we ask when we think about a question like that be could congress have write the statute could congress have serve its objective in an entirely gender neutral way and it seem as though here we have the the secretary of state present a statute to congress that actually do that could i I be sorry we be you finish could i i mean we generally have a rule that when we find an equal protection violation we level up rather than level down that be be the court s consistent practice would not you agree well i find one compel reason to do it and i just think I would offer this up to you and see what you have to say be that in this case unlike in some case there really be not a choice between level up and level down in one sense because if you level down this party get no relief in other word you say well you level you just apply it prospectively but then this party get absolutely no relief and so be not that a problem be not it the kind of the same problem as justice harlan recognize in in welsh when he be deal with a criminal matter he say you know you can not level down because you can not give everybody the exact same benefit so how do we deal with that but not really a situation like this not a situation where we say uh there be an equal protection violation and if we extend the benefit to everybody we can take care of that equal protection violation we can remedy the problem but if we do not if we try to level down the effect of that be that the the party before us who have prove an equal protection violation get absolutely no relief at all i mean the problem be not it mr broome that the very inequality that you be complain of would remain because it be impossible to claw back everybody else s citizenship so it be really impossible to level down and the very inequality that we have just find would remain but it be not just that it do not give you citizenship it be that it do not cure the inequality at all either by level down or by level up mr kneedler but before you before you do that mr broome just on the remedy question very occasionally this court have face a situation when the natural remedy of something that it be hold we we be concern a little bit about how whether congress would prefer a different remedy so for example in the northern pipeline case what we do in a situation like that be we stay our judgment for a period of time and allow congress essentially to do it a different way if it want to and I be wonder whether you have consider that possibility here that we could order a kind of level up judgment but stay it for some period of time so that congress could decide whether it instead prefer some other way of deal with the problem whether that would be appropriate ,228.24,Roberts Court,"Nov 9, 2016","Jeffrey B.

2016,Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions,114,Elena Kagan,"I'm -- I'm sorry, Mr. Fisher. You just said something that I think you did not say in your briefs, so let me ask you about that. You just gave us your definition of what the generic offense is. It's understand 16. Because I understood in your briefs you just said whatever the generic offense is, it doesn't include this activity. But do you have a definition of what the generic offense is? And if so, did you just say it? Do you have any further views of what the generic offense is? Are there other elements of the generic offense that you're willing to tell us you think? I mean usually, in these cases, first we define the generic offense, and then we see whether the State statute in question fits within that or doesn't. And so what is the generic offense? It's under 16. Anything else? But why would you think that, Mr. Fisher? I mean, there -- in this statute, there are loads of cross-references. And this one is not a cross-reference. So doesn't that tell us something? Are you suggesting, Mr. Fisher, that if we turn Chevron off, we have to turn lenity on? Couldn't there be a middle ground between the two; in other words, some space where you say, because of this -- the -- the criminal application of this statute, we don't apply ordinary Chevron deference, but at the same time, we don't go straight into the kind of grievous ambiguity that -- that triggers lenity? There's some middle area where the Court gets to decide just what is -- it thinks is the best construction of the statute? It works -- it works, if you think that ambiguity doesn't necessarily mean the same thing for Chevron purposes and for lenity purposes. The lenity purposes really demands grievous ambiguity, and but there's some sense in which there's -- there's a of lack clarity, a lack of clear meaning that allows the Court to decide what the best interpretation of the language is. I don't really understand that -- that canon, because that canon would suggest that we never give the BIA deference as to its interpretation of this statute. And, in fact, when it comes to noncriminal things, we give the BIA very substantial deference. Well, Mr. Kedem, you don't disagree, do you, with the premise that the first thing that we should do is to define the generic crime; is that right? Okay. So you say that's step one. And then you say, well, you define the generic -- in this case you say the generic crime is whatever is illegal under State law. That's one of your -- Yeah. So that seems to be like just not what generic crimes are. In other words, you're just saying, well, it's whatever the States consider illegal, when the whole idea of a generic crime is that it's not just anything that's illegal, it's the prototypical case, even though that differs from what some States do. Yes. But you're carving out one element, which is the age element -- -- and saying whatever a State does goes. So I thought that that was sort of the antithesis of the generic offense approach. It's really like a freshman in college going out with a junior in college. Mr. Kedem, you have here -- you have a federal statute. You have the Model Penal Code, which goes the same way. You have 30-plus State laws. So at the least, am I right that -- that you concede that you can't win unless Chevron applies; is that correct? You think it's unambiguous, this kind of pragmatic construction about -- what did you say -- like power differentials -- I -- I guess I don't understand that. You're saying that it would be the -- the clearly better reading to go -- to -- to say notwithstanding the Federal statute, notwithstanding 30-plus State statutes, notwithstanding the Model Penal Code, we just know that when somebody talks about sexual abuse of a minor, they're talking about age 18 with a three-year differential? Well, I'm asking -- -- about normal statutory interpretation. The normal statutory interpretation get you to think that out of, like -- out of our heads pops 18 plus a three-year differential -- -- looking at -- as opposed to looking at 30-plus States, the Model Penal Code, and the Federal statute, which all define it differently. Mr. Kedem, can I say that -- -- I think you disagree with two parts of that. Because the first thing you said to me was that you agree that the first thing that has to be done is to define a generic offense. So Justice Alito was suggesting that, in this case, we shouldn't do that at all. So you disagree there. And then Justice Alito said, in this case you just have to think like, what does the BIA think about this? But you said to me, even without deference, you win. So -- so you're taking a very different view than Justice Alito is. You're saying that what the BIA interpretation was is the best understanding of the generic offense. So, Mr. Kedem, Mr. Fisher said and I just want to make sure that this is right, that you no longer rely on the statute that the BIA relied on; is that correct? Okay. So the answer is no. So what -- what do you rely on? What are the sources that you rely on to generate this definition? Because you're not relying on the Federal statute. You're not relying on the most common State statutes. You're not relying on the other Federal statute that the BIA relied on. What are you relying on to generate this definition? I'm asking for ordinary -- The term -- So the -- the dictionary definition that you pull out is illegal sex acts performed against a minor by a parent, guardian, relative, or acquaintance. Is that the one? Yeah. But you're not using by a parent, guardian, relative, or acquaintance; is that right? No, no, no, no, no. But this -- this limits it to those relationships. That's what this does -- Okay. Anything else? Dictionary definition. What else? What are -- what are those? One -- one's -- one deals with the rights of child witnesses. The other is a rule for calculating the duration of unlawful presence. Are those the two? So those two, which really have nothing to do with the generic meaning of sexual abuse of a minor. A single dictionary -- a single dictionary definition, and some legislative history that even you indicate is sparse. ",I be I be sorry mr fisher you just say something that i think you do not say in your brief so let me ask you about that you just give us your definition of what the generic offense be it be understand because i understood in your brief you just say whatever the generic offense be it do not include this activity but do you have a definition of what the generic offense be and if so do you just say it do you have any further view of what the generic offense be be there other element of the generic offense that you be willing to tell us you think i mean usually in these case first we define the generic offense and then we see whether the state statute in question fit within that or do not and so what be the generic offense it be under anything else but why would you think that mr fisher i mean there in this statute there be load of cross reference and this one be not a cross reference so do not that tell us something be you suggest mr fisher that if we turn chevron off we have to turn lenity on could not there be a middle ground between the two in other word some space where you say because of this the the criminal application of this statute we do not apply ordinary chevron deference but at the same time we do not go straight into the kind of grievous ambiguity that that trigger lenity there be some middle area where the court get to decide just what be it think be the best construction of the statute it work it work if you think that ambiguity do not necessarily mean the same thing for chevron purpose and for lenity purpose the lenity purpose really demand grievous ambiguity and but there be some sense in which there be there be a of lack clarity a lack of clear meaning that allow the court to decide what the best interpretation of the language be i do not really understand that that canon because that canon would suggest that we never give the bia deference as to its interpretation of this statute and in fact when it come to noncriminal thing we give the bia very substantial deference well mr kedem you do not disagree do you with the premise that the first thing that we should do be to define the generic crime be that right okay so you say that be step one and then you say well you define the generic in this case you say the generic crime be whatever be illegal under state law that be one of your yeah so that seem to be like just not what generic crime be in other word you be just say well it be whatever the state consider illegal when the whole idea of a generic crime be that it be not just anything that be illegal it be the prototypical case even though that differs from what some state do yes but you be carve out one element which be the age element and say whatever a state do go so i think that that be sort of the antithesis of the generic offense approach it be really like a freshman in college go out with a junior in college mr kedem you have here you have a federal statute you have the model penal code which go the same way you have plus state law so at the least be i right that that you concede that you can not win unless chevron applies be that correct you think it be unambiguous this kind of pragmatic construction about what do you say like power differential i i guess i do not understand that you be say that it would be the the clearly well reading to go to to say notwithstanding the federal statute notwithstanding plus state statute notwithstanding the model penal code we just know that when somebody talk about sexual abuse of a minor they be talk about age with a three year differential well I be ask about normal statutory interpretation the normal statutory interpretation get you to think that out of like out of our head pop plus a three year differential look at as oppose to look at plus state the model penal code and the federal statute which all define it differently mr kedem can i say that i think you disagree with two part of that because the first thing you say to me be that you agree that the first thing that have to be do be to define a generic offense so justice alito be suggest that in this case we should not do that at all so you disagree there and then justice alito say in this case you just have to think like what do the bia think about this but you say to me even without deference you win so so you be take a very different view than justice alito be you be say that what the bia interpretation be be the best understanding of the generic offense so mr kedem mr fisher say and i just want to make sure that this be right that you no longer rely on the statute that the bia rely on be that correct okay so the answer be no so what what do you rely on what be the source that you rely on to generate this definition because you be not rely on the federal statute you be not rely on the most common state statute you be not rely on the other federal statute that the bia rely on what be you rely on to generate this definition I be ask for ordinary the term so the the dictionary definition that you pull out be illegal sex act perform against a minor by a parent guardian relative or acquaintance be that the one yeah but you be not use by a parent guardian relative or acquaintance be that right no no no no no but this this limit it to those relationship that be what this do okay anything else dictionary definition what else what be what be those one one s one deal with the right of child witness the other be a rule for calculate the duration of unlawful presence be those the two so those two which really have nothing to do with the generic meaning of sexual abuse of a minor a single dictionary a single dictionary definition and some legislative history that even you indicate be sparse ,383.47000000000014,Roberts Court,"Feb 27,

2016,Salman v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"Ms. Shapiro, you're asking us to ignore some extremely specific language in Dirks, which of course, was decided quite some time ago. So I'm just going read in Dirks. The Court is talking about when it would be proper under the statute to convict somebody for insider trading, it's because there might be a relationship between the insider and the recipient, or an intention to benefit the particular recipient. And then it goes on to say, ""When an insider makes a gift of confidential information to a trading relative or friend,"" and then in the last paragraph of the opinion, where it's really summing up everything that it's done, the Court says, ""The tippers received no monetary or personal benefit, nor was their purpose to make a gift of valuable information to the tippee."" So there's a lot of language in Dirks which is very specific about, it's not only when there's a quid pro quo from the tippee to the tipper, but when the tipper makes a gift to the tippee, and in particular a relative or friend. More than mention. This is like half their holding. I don't know what ""dictum"" -- what ""dictum"" means. The court is very clearly setting out a test here. And this is part of the test. Ms. Shapiro, let me give you a hypothetical. Let's suppose I would like to give a gift to a friend of mine, but it's just too expensive for me to give it. And then I pass a coworker's desk, and I see a hundred dollar bill sitting there, and I take the hundred dollar bill; and now I can give a gift that I had wanted to give, but I couldn't. Now, have I benefitted from stealing the hundred dollar bill? Yes, you have. And why should the issue be any different if, instead of stealing the hundred dollar bill off my coworker's desk, I instead steal information and give the gift of that information rather than give a gift of cash? I think what I'm suggesting by the hypothetical is that we all have our own interests and purposes behind giving gifts. Some of those might be very practical and pragmatic. Some of them might be more altruistic. But we give gifts for individual interests and purposes. And here, I'm stealing corporate information. It's essentially a kind of embezzlement or conversion. I'm stealing information to give a gift to somebody I know. It might be, as in this case, a family member. It might be a friend. And I benefit from that because -- I mean, it's the -- I personally benefit. It's the exact opposite of using corporate information for corporate purposes. I'm using it for my own personal purposes. Ms. Shapiro, here is not a question of expanding it further. You're asking us to cut back significantly from something that we said several decades ago, something that Congress has shown no indication that it's unhappy with, and in a context in which, I mean, obviously the integrity of the markets are a very important thing for this country. And you're asking us essentially to change the rules in a way that threatens that integrity. No, I wasn't suggesting that there was -- there are easy answers to the question of what contributes to the integrity of the market. I was suggesting that it's a reason for caution in changing a 30-year-old rule that everybody has understood and lived by, and that -- that Congress has shown no indication it's unhappy with. Let's look at -- on the other side, if you think about the tipper now. You've used a couple of times the phrase ""knowledge"" or ""anticipation."" That there would be trading. So is -- is that something more than he thinks there could be -- -- he thinks there -- I mean, he thinks there would be? Is it as strong as that? Is anticipated the same as he knew he would? But it's not enough. It's like, well, I think he might or -- -- or, you know, I'm sort of betting that he would, but I don't really know. Mr. Dreeben, I get your -- your theory and why it doesn't make any particular difference. And indeed, in that same paragraph where the Court says relatives or friends, the Court, just a sentence before, just talks about an intention to benefit a recipient -- -- without any sense of who that recipient has to be. On the other hand, as you say, almost all of these cases are relatives and friends. And things might look different if we had a case that was not a relative or friend. And why not separate out that strange, unusual, hardly-ever-prosecuted situation and say we're not dealing with that here? We have nothing to say about it.

2016,"California Public Employees’ Retirement System v. ANZ Securities, Inc.",114,Elena Kagan,"As a practical matter or as a formal matter? Mr. Goldstein, could I ask you to speak to this question of your alternative theories, because in your briefing, the non-tolling theory, if I can call it that, took pride of place. But you haven't really spoken in those terms today. So what am I to make of that? The two-tiered structure can be where the second tier just cuts off the discovery rule. So that would perfectly well explain the two-tiered structure just as that, and say, yeah, usually it's one year after discovery, but if you discover it five years later, that's too much. So it just cuts off the discovery rule. And that's the only thing that the two-tiered structure means perhaps. I suppose one question is, what exactly do -- have we meant when we say a statute of repose? And we've certainly meant something different from a statute of limitations. But I think what we were talking about in Lampf was the cutoff of the discovery rule. It -- it sort of didn't matter whether your claim was going to accrue in the normal way, consistent with the statute of limitations. At some point, we were going to cut it off. And that's what we meant when we said statute of repose, as opposed to some term that cut off a variety of claims that just weren't before us and that we weren't thinking about. Well, you're suggesting we -- there's only one view of the word ""action,"" and -- and the case stops there. And perhaps that's right, but let's say it's not right. Let's just suppose that ""action"" is a word that sometimes it's used one way, and sometimes it's used another way, and we should look a little bit as to the practical consequences of what you're doing. And it seems as though -- and tell me if you think this is wrong -- that the consequences go something like this: If we go your way in this case, any future suit like this, all large investors, the kind of investors CalPERS -- CalPERS is not going to make this mistake again. CalPERS is going to file a protective action for itself, and then it can do what it wants. Opt out, don't opt out, wait and see, whatever. Well, small investors are not going to do that. They're not going to have the faintest idea that they should be doing that. So this is a rule that's kind of guaranteed to create make-work for district courts to be essentially irrelevant for large investors, and for small investors to lose their claims. I know you think that -- But just to -- It puts tremendous pressure on the opt-out right, right? We're used to thinking that the opt-out right is a very important part of class actions; it's what saves them from a due process problem, that people actually do get to say, I don't want any part of this. And you're saying they only get to say that within 3 years, which may be not within 3 years of the time the suit was brought; it may be 6 months of the time the suit was brought, or 1 month or something like that. And, you know, if -- if you haven't decided within that month or 6 months that these lawyers are not doing a good job, you've lost your ability forever to do it for yourself. All power to you, but, you know, a lot of those settlement hearings are awfully tough. But Rule 23 did not want that to happen. Rule 23 wanted to allow people to opt out rather than to be confined in the suit for the entire pendency of the suit and then to start fighting the outcome at the -- at the last moment. It's not much of an opt-out right. Go ahead, opt out, but -- but you can't bring your own claim. ",as a practical matter or as a formal matter mr goldstein could i ask you to speak to this question of your alternative theory because in your briefing the non toll theory if i can call it that take pride of place but you have not really speak in those term today so what be i to make of that the two tiered structure can be where the second tier just cut off the discovery rule so that would perfectly well explain the two tiered structure just as that and say yeah usually it be one year after discovery but if you discover it five year later that be too much so it just cut off the discovery rule and that be the only thing that the two tiered structure mean perhaps i suppose one question be what exactly do have we mean when we say a statute of repose and we have certainly mean something different from a statute of limitation but i think what we we be talk about in lampf be the cutoff of the discovery rule it it sort of do not matter whether your claim be go to accrue in the normal way consistent with the statute of limitation at some point we we be go to cut it off and that be what we mean when we say statute of repose as oppose to some term that cut off a variety of claim that just be not before us and that we be not think about well you be suggest we there be only one view of the word action and and the case stop there and perhaps that be right but let us say it be not right let us just suppose that action be a word that sometimes it be use one way and sometimes it be use another way and we should look a little bit as to the practical consequence of what you be do and it seem as though and tell me if you think this be wrong that the consequence go something like this if we go your way in this case any future suit like this all large investor the kind of investor calpers calpers be not go to make this mistake again calpers be go to file a protective action for itself and then it can do what it want opt out do not opt out wait and see whatever well small investor be not go to do that they be not go to have the faint idea that they should be do that so this be a rule that be kind of guarantee to create make work for district court to be essentially irrelevant for large investor and for small investor to lose their claim i know you think that but just to it put tremendous pressure on the opt out right right we be use to think that the opt out right be a very important part of class action it be what save them from a due process problem that people actually do get to say i do not want any part of this and you be say they only get to say that within year which may be not within year of the time the suit be bring it may be month of the time the suit be bring or month or something like that and you know if if you have not decide within that month or month that these lawyer be not do a good job you have lose your ability forever to do it for yourself all power to you but you know a lot of those settlement hearing be awfully tough but rule do not want that to happen rule want to allow people to opt out rather than to be confine in the suit for the entire pendency of the suit and then to start fight the outcome at the at the last moment it be not much of an opt out right go ahead opt out but but you can not bring your own claim ,200.72,Roberts Court,"Apr 17, 2017",California Public Employees' Retirement System,"ANZ Securities, Inc., et al.",16-373,"Jan 13, 2017","Jun 26, 2017",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2016,Turner v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, why wouldn't that have happened anyway? I mean, even if you had this alternative-perpetrator theory, there's still a lot of defendants with a lot of lawyers with -- seems still a strong incentive to point at the other folks and say it was them, it wasn't me. Ms. Rice -- The matter of Eleby that you were talking about, this is what the government says about that, and I just wondered whether, what your reaction was to it. The government responds Eleby was not fabricating evidence, rather she was creating false corroboration for something that was true. You're kind Ms. Rice, I would have said creating false corroboration is fabricating evidence. Well, Mr. Dreeben, of course that's right because that was the only theory in the case. And the question is, what would have happened if the prosecutors had given over this evidence such that an alternative theory of the case could have been proposed? I mean, one of the things that you get when you read these briefs and when you read the transcripts is, this was kind of guaranteed to be bad for the defendants in the sense that, without any alternative theory, it was -- it was a circular firing squad, and it was, you know, you should believe the guy who doesn't incriminate me, but of course you should believe him as to everybody else. And all ten of these people saying this, it created the worst of all possible worlds for the defendants. And I think what they are saying now is as compared to that, of course we would have run with this alternative theory and it would have been an -- a completely different trial. Mr. Dreeben, can I ask about the facts of this? And it's a -- it's a similar question on the other side to the one Justice Alito asked about the garage. Just when I sort of think of the fact it -- it's 5 o'clock on a Monday, it's on H Street, a busy thoroughfare. There -- in -- in the prosecution's view of this there are 15 or 20 people carrying out this pincer movement, as you describe it. There's an alleyway, but it's backed up by houses on both sides. Why is it that in the end, the government's witnesses were two people who were charged and were making a deal with the government and who had reasons to make a deal with the government, a couple of really drug-addled people and a 14-year-old boy? I mean, you would think that in this community there would be so many people who would see the kind of attack that the government suggests happened here, and why wasn't that the case? Of course, the prosecutors did not know this, but in the end McMillan commits a crime very much like this. Why does Michelle Roberts, who has a client who the evidence is quite weak against, say that she certainly would have run with this evidence. And she's -- you know, when you read some aspects of this transcript again, you see that although the ten lawyers had ten different sets of interests, to the extent that there is a lead lawyer in this case, it's Michelle Roberts who was the PDS lawyer, who was a woman of incredible skill and experience, and says she clearly would have gone with this evidence. ",well why would not that have happen anyway i mean even if you have this alternative perpetrator theory there be still a lot of defendant with a lot of lawyer with seem still a strong incentive to point at the other folk and say it be them it be not me ms rice the matter of eleby that you we be talk about this be what the government say about that and i just wonder whether what your reaction be to it the government respond eleby be not fabricating evidence rather she be create false corroboration for something that be true you be kind ms rice i would have say create false corroboration be fabricate evidence well mr dreeben of course that be right because that be the only theory in the case and the question be what would have happen if the prosecutor have give over this evidence such that an alternative theory of the case could have be propose i mean one of the thing that you get when you read these brief and when you read the transcript be this be kind of guarantee to be bad for the defendant in the sense that without any alternative theory it be it be a circular firing squad and it be you know you should believe the guy who do not incriminate me but of course you should believe him as to everybody else and all ten of these people say this it create the bad of all possible world for the defendant and i think what they be say now be as compare to that of course we would have run with this alternative theory and it would have be an a completely different trial mr dreeben can i ask about the fact of this and it be a it be a similar question on the other side to the one justice alito ask about the garage just when i sort of think of the fact it it be of the clock on a monday it be on h street a busy thoroughfare there in in the prosecution s view of this there be or people carry out this pincer movement as you describe it there be an alleyway but it be back up by house on both side why be it that in the end the government s witness we be two people who we be charge and we be make a deal with the government and who have reason to make a deal with the government a couple of really drug addle people and a year old boy i mean you would think that in this community there would be so many people who would see the kind of attack that the government suggest happen here and why be not that the case of course the prosecutor do not know this but in the end mcmillan commit a crime very much like this why do michelle robert who have a client who the evidence be quite weak against say that she certainly would have run with this evidence and she be you know when you read some aspect of this transcript again you see that although the ten lawyer have ten different set of interest to the extent that there be a lead lawyer in this case it be michelle robert who be the pds lawyer who be a woman of incredible skill and experience and say she clearly would have go with this evidence ,192.68,Roberts Court,"Mar 29, 2017","Charles S.

2016,Czyzewski v. Jevic Holding Corp.,114,Elena Kagan,"Why do you think -- Why do you think, though, it isn't mentioned someplace in the Code? I mean, did Congress just not think that this might happen? May I ask, Ms. Spinelli, just quickly: What's the scope of the holding that you would like us to issue? I suppose this comes back to Justice Alito's question of what's actually on the table. All settlements? All structured dismissals? Just this particular kind? And if just this particular kind, how would you characterize it? So a settlement that is a -- a -- that -- that distributes protest -- proceeds. Just to make sure I understand the scope of what you're saying we should decide: Would that also knock out the thing that was approved in Iridium itself? Let me ask you -- -- Mr. Ernest, sort of a similar question. You -- here's two different kinds of bankruptcy schemes. One scheme just says every time you distribute assets, you have to follow the following order: one, two, three, four, five. That's -- and that's it. You just have to follow that order. That's one Bankruptcy Code. Here's another Bankruptcy Code: It says presumptively, you have to follow one, two, three, four, five, but if there is a Pareto-superior solution, in other words, a solution in which some people are made off and nobody -- in which some people are -- get better outcomes and nobody gets a worse outcome -- -- if there is such a solution, you can go with that. And that might be a completely sensible bankruptcy provision -- -- for Congress to have enacted. The question is whether Congress did enact it and what you can point to in the Bankruptcy Code that suggests that the continual statement that it's just one, two, three, four, five is subject to a kind of equitable exception for Pareto-superior outcomes. But, Mr. Landau -- I mean, you might be right or you might be wrong about that. Let's just assume that you are right, that -- that this is one of these extraordinary circumstances in which some people can be made better off and nobody will be made worse off. Still the question is, where is the authorization for that in the Bankruptcy Code? Because that's like a big principle. I mean -- and I think we would have known about it if that's the way bankruptcy proceedings were supposed to go. And -- and you suggest while it's in this ""for cause"" language, but this ""for cause"" language, I mean, this is a pretty specific provision that we're talking about. What it says is that when you can't reach a plan and the case has to be dismissed, this is attached to a provision that says everything has to be rolled back. And -- and this says, well, not -- you know, maybe, if there is a good reason, not everything has to be -- -- rolled back to exactly the way it was. But that's a really different kind of provision than saying, in courts, you get to decide or -- or -- or parties, really, you get to decide, and then courts get to -- get to approve an outcome of a bankruptcy proceeding that does not follow the usual priority rules just because these particular parties, not all of them, but these particular parties think it will make some people better off without making other peoples worse off. But then doesn't that run into -- this is what Ms. Harrington ended her remarks by saying, is that you're just saying the plans that the Bankruptcy Code declare not confirmable are, in fact, going to be confirmed through this alternative procedure? ",why do you think why do you think though it be not mentioned someplace in the code i mean do congress just not think that this might happen may i ask ms spinelli just quickly what be the scope of the hold that you would like us to issue i suppose this come back to justice alito s question of what be actually on the table all settlement all structure dismissal just this particular kind and if just this particular kind how would you characterize it so a settlement that be a a that that distribute protest proceeds just to make sure i understand the scope of what you be say we should decide would that also knock out the thing that be approve in iridium itself let me ask you mr ernest sort of a similar question you here s two different kind of bankruptcy scheme one scheme just say every time you distribute asset you have to follow the following order one two three four five that be and that be it you just have to follow that order that be one bankruptcy code here s another bankruptcy code it say presumptively you have to follow one two three four five but if there be a pareto superior solution in other word a solution in which some people be make off and nobody in which some people be get good outcome and nobody get a bad outcome if there be such a solution you can go with that and that might be a completely sensible bankruptcy provision for congress to have enact the question be whether congress do enact it and what you can point to in the bankruptcy code that suggest that the continual statement that it be just one two three four five be subject to a kind of equitable exception for pareto superior outcome but mr landau i mean you might be right or you might be wrong about that let us just assume that you be right that that this be one of these extraordinary circumstance in which some people can be make good off and nobody will be make bad off still the question be where be the authorization for that in the bankruptcy code because that be like a big principle i mean and i think we would have know about it if that be the way bankruptcy proceedings we be suppose to go and and you suggest while it be in this for because language but this for because language i mean this be a pretty specific provision that we be talk about what it say be that when you can not reach a plan and the case have to be dismiss this be attach to a provision that say everything have to be roll back and and this say well not you know maybe if there be a good reason not everything have to be roll back to exactly the way it be but that be a really different kind of provision than say in court you get to decide or or or party really you get to decide and then court get to get to approve an outcome of a bankruptcy proceed that do not follow the usual priority rule just because these particular party not all of them but these particular party think it will make some people better off without make other people bad off but then do not that run into this be what ms harrington end her remark by say be that you be just say the plan that the bankruptcy code declare not confirmable be in fact go to be confirm through this alternative procedure ,202.3,Roberts Court,"Dec 7, 2016","Casimir Czyzewski, et al.","Jevic Holding Corp., et al.",15-649,"Jun 28, 2016","Mar 22, 2017",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2017,Minnesota Voters Alliance v. Mansky,114,Elena Kagan,"Do you think more -- Do you -- do you think, Mr. Breemer, that a statute could target only electoral speech, in other words, ""Clinton for President,"" ""Trump for President,"" that sort of thing? Could a statute say that that speech cannot be worn in the polling place? No, I know. But it -- could a statute constitutionally say that? If it were limited to that, would that be permissible, or is it impermissible? I know, but I'm just asking your view. And -- and what would be the justification for that line, in your view? In other words, why would we put one -- all the materials that Justice Alito talked about on one side of the line and all the materials that you think a state cannot restrict on the other side of the line? In your view, what's the difference? It -- it just is a little bit hard, Mr. Breemer, to evaluate an argument of overbreadth unless we have a clear view from you as to how far you think a state could go. So I'm not sure that you've given us that view. I mean, are you -- do you want to accept Justice Alito's suggestion, or do you want to draw the line at some other place so that we know, okay, that's permissible, this is impermissible, how does this relate to that? That's the usual way overbreadth analysis goes. If -- if that were where we drew the line, I mean, what -- what would be encompassed in advocacy material? Would it be only things that named a candidate's name? How about if it said ""Resist""? ""Make America Great Again""? Do you know how often, Mr. Rogan, people are asked to cover things up? I mean, do people know about this statute and act accordingly, or do you often find, is it, you know, every other voter is wearing something? What -- what -- or something in between? Mr. Rogan, could you explain that for me a little bit more? Because, I mean, there are clearly some places where we think -- you know, the courtroom is a good example, where we don't want anybody to be wearing buttons or wearing shirts of -- of the kind that you're talking about. But why should a polling place be that sort of place? In other words, you talk about the decorum, the solemnity. Makes it sound a little bit church-like. Why is a polling place that? Why isn't it just the culmination of what is often a rowdy political process? Mr. Rogan, I assume that the real work of this statute is being done by the fact that people know about it and so people just don't wear these things for the most part. And you're always going to have cases where people don't know about it or maybe they want to challenge it, but those are going to be few and far between, and -- and the real work is that people just approach the polling place in a different kind of way. Maybe you should make it broader. (Laughter.) ",do you think more do you do you think mr breemer that a statute could target only electoral speech in other word clinton for president trump for president that sort of thing could a statute say that that speech can not be wear in the polling place no i know but it could a statute constitutionally say that if it we be limited to that would that be permissible or be it impermissible i know but I be just ask your view and and what would be the justification for that line in your view in other word why would we put one all the material that justice alito talk about on one side of the line and all the material that you think a state can not restrict on the other side of the line in your view what be the difference it it just be a little bit hard mr breemer to evaluate an argument of overbreadth unless we have a clear view from you as to how far you think a state could go so I be not sure that you have give us that view i mean be you do you want to accept justice alito s suggestion or do you want to draw the line at some other place so that we know okay that be permissible this be impermissible how do this relate to that that be the usual way overbreadth analysis go if if that we be where we draw the line i mean what what would be encompass in advocacy material would it be only thing that name a candidate s name how about if it say resist make america great again do you know how often mr rogan people be ask to cover thing up i mean do people know about this statute and act accordingly or do you often find be it you know every other voter be wear something what what or something in between mr rogan could you explain that for me a little bit more because i mean there be clearly some place where we think you know the courtroom be a good example where we do not want anybody to be wear button or wear shirt of of the kind that you be talk about but why should a polling place be that sort of place in other word you talk about the decorum the solemnity make it sound a little bit church like why be a polling place that why be not it just the culmination of what be often a rowdy political process mr rogan i assume that the real work of this statute be be do by the fact that people know about it and so people just do not wear these thing for the most part and you be always go to have case where people do not know about it or maybe they want to challenge it but those be go to be few and far between and and the real work be that people just approach the polling place in a different kind of way maybe you should make it broad laughter ,174.39999999999995,Roberts Court,"Feb 28, 2018","Minnesota Voters Alliance, et al.","Joe Mansky, et al.",16-1435,"Nov 13, 2017","Jun 14, 2018",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2017,McCoy v. Louisiana,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Waxman, can I take you back to the Chief Justice's question? Because here we do have a case where the defendant is saying you can't admit the actus reus, which is killing. I didn't kill my family. You can't say I killed my family. But there are different levels of generality, right? One is you can't say that I didn't kill my family. One is you -- you -- you can't say that I committed the actus reus no matter what the actus reus is. And another is you can't say that I committed any element of the offense, actus reus or otherwise. And if I understood your argument, you're saying that the logic of your position takes you from this case, which is an actus reus of killing, to any actus reus and then further from there to any element. And I guess I wonder, why is it that the logic of your position insists that we go up that chain? Well, for sure we've given lawyers a lot of leeway to make quite a number of decisions when they're representing a defendant, troubled and untroubled, and the idea is that lawyers know better, sometimes, than their clients and that we should want to lodge a great many strategic decisions in their hands rather than in the client's. But you're not talking about here, or we're not talking about here, about how to pursue a set of objectives. Is it better to pursue it this way or is it better to pursue it that way? We're talking about a client saying: You have to follow -- I have -- I have an overriding objective in this case, and that's to avoid the opprobrium that comes with admitting that I killed family members. And that's my overriding objective. And you're saying that the lawyer can say it doesn't matter that that's your overriding objective. And I guess what I want to know is why. But the client is saying that -- that his ultimate objective is not to defeat the death penalty. In other words, you just have conflicting objectives. I mean, I totally understand that this lawyer was in a terrible position because this lawyer wants to defeat the death penalty. And he has a client who says: That's not my goal here. But the question is, when that happens, does the lawyer have to step back and say: You know what? That's not his goal. His goal is to avoid admitting that he killed his family members. He -- But, Ms. Murrill, I -- I think all these questions go to the same point, which is Strickland seems a very awkward fit here because there's nothing wrong with what this lawyer did if the goal is avoiding the death penalty. This lawyer probably did the best thing, the thing that a good lawyer would do if the goal were avoiding the death penalty. The problem that this case presents is something different. It's the lawyer's substitution of his goal of avoiding the death penalty for the client's goal, as the Chief Justice said, I don't care about that. I don't want to avoid the death penalty. I -- I -- that's not my paramount goal. My paramount goal is to insist until my last breath that I didn't kill my family members. ",mr waxman can i take you back to the chief justice s question because here we do have a case where the defendant be say you can not admit the actus reus which be kill i do not kill my family you can not say i kill my family but there be different level of generality right one be you can not say that i do not kill my family one be you you you can not say that i commit the actus reus no matter what the actus reus be and another be you can not say that i commit any element of the offense actus reus or otherwise and if i understand your argument you be say that the logic of your position take you from this case which be an actus reus of kill to any actus reus and then far from there to any element and i guess i wonder why be it that the logic of your position insist that we go up that chain well for sure we have give lawyer a lot of leeway to make quite a number of decision when they be represent a defendant troubled and untroubled and the idea be that lawyer know well sometimes than their client and that we should want to lodge a great many strategic decision in their hand rather than in the client s but you be not talk about here or we be not talk about here about how to pursue a set of objective be it good to pursue it this way or be it good to pursue it that way we be talk about a client say you have to follow i have i have an override objective in this case and that be to avoid the opprobrium that come with admit that i kill family member and that be my override objective and you be say that the lawyer can say it do not matter that that be your override objective and i guess what i want to know be why but the client be say that that his ultimate objective be not to defeat the death penalty in other word you just have conflict objective i mean i totally understand that this lawyer be in a terrible position because this lawyer want to defeat the death penalty and he have a client who say that be not my goal here but the question be when that happen do the lawyer have to step back and say you know what that be not his goal his goal be to avoid admit that he kill his family member he but ms murrill i i think all these question go to the same point which be strickland seem a very awkward fit here because there be nothing wrong with what this lawyer do if the goal be avoid the death penalty this lawyer probably do the best thing the thing that a good lawyer would do if the goal we be avoid the death penalty the problem that this case present be something different it be the lawyer s substitution of his goal of avoid the death penalty for the client s goal as the chief justice say i do not care about that i do not want to avoid the death penalty i i that be not my paramount goal my paramount goal be to insist until my last breath that i do not kill my family member ,207.32,Roberts Court,"Jan 17, 2018",Robert McCoy,State of Louisiana,16-8255,"Sep 28, 2017","May 14, 2018",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2017,Benisek v. Lamone,114,Elena Kagan,"But is your theory that that would be a compelling interest that could defeat strict scrutiny? In other words, the way I understand your theory is that you would put the state in that position to the test of -- of saying this is a compelling interest, this is the only way we can achieve that interest, and -- and sort of put it through the strict scrutiny hoops, even when the state, you know, wants to achieve balanced districts or wants to undo a former gerrymander, so you would still put the state through a very strict scrutiny test in that case? But, Mr. Kimberly -- Well, may I give you a hypothetical that gets to Justice Ginsburg's question? Suppose you had a district and there was a reapportionment and we realized we have to add 15,000 votes -- voters to this district. And they looked at the numbers and they said: You know what, if -- this is a solid Republican district, but if we add 15,000 voters from a Democratic area, we're going to turn this into a highly competitive district. Would -- you would now force the state to meet a strict scrutiny burden on that, wouldn't you? We are taking 15,000 of the bluest blue voters, and we're parking them in this district in order to convert the district from a safe Republican district to a competitive district. How do you analyze that? We want another Democratic senator. Well, Mr. Sullivan, let's say you're right, that they have not shown us how much is too much, that they have suggested that in any forum, when there's partisan advantage, the courts should be intervening. But we don't have to say something like that to deal with this case because, however much you think is too much, this case is too much. (Laughter.) I mean, I think. You'll tell me I'm wrong. But, as Justice Sotomayor said, you know, from the Governor, from Congressman Hoyer, people were very upfront about what they were trying to do here, which was to create another Democratic district. And they did that. Only 10,000 people had to be removed from this district as a result of one person/one vote. What -- what the Maryland legislature did was to shuffle 360,000 people out and bring in 350,000 people. The result of that is that the district went from 47 percent Republican and 36 percent Democratic to exactly the opposite, 45 percent Democratic and 34 percent Republican. I mean, how much more evidence of partisan intent could we need? Plus 2. You're referring to the single election? Is -- is that what you're referring to? I mean, Democrats have now prevailed in three straight elections, including in an election which was a wave Republican election. So the effects were exactly what the intent would suggest: A long-standing Republican incumbent is unseated by a Democratic newcomer, who withstands a wave election, who prevails three straight times. I mean, it appears that the Maryland legislature got exactly what it intended, which was you took a Republican district, like a safe Republican district, and made it into not the safest of Democratic districts but a pretty safe one. Well, suppose, Mr. Sullivan, that the Maryland legislature passed a statute. What is -- Maryland is about a 60/40 Democratic/Republican state? Is that right? Yes, 60 -- 60/40. Suppose the Maryland legislature passed a statute and said, in the next round of reapportionment, we're going to create seven Democratic districts and one Republican district. Well, that is what then -- I mean, the Chief Justice said the -- the reapportionment statute is that statute. The districting statute is that. But isn't -- isn't it true, Mr. Sullivan, just as a matter of fact, that most people who are independents tend to lean pretty strongly one way or the other over many election cycles? I wasn't suggesting that they were anything in particular, just, you know, people who call themselves independents and who, in fact, are not members of a political party, you know, tend to -- not all of them, but many of them, tend to vote pretty consistently one way. And this is why when mapmakers do their mapmaking, they look not only to party registration; they look to the way people vote, and what they find is that more members than just the members of the political party -- more voters vote pretty consistently. I guess I don't quite understand that, Mr. Sullivan. In the racial gerrymander cases, this is exactly what we do in much harder circumstances, actually. I mean, it's the same in the sense that we look to what legislators say. We look to what mapmakers say. We look to a variety of pieces of circumstantial evidence about how the districting turned out, about what was done. And the reason I say it's harder there than it is here is because there we have to deal with the kind of confluence of race and politics. But here, when you look at this kind of maneuvering and it's all about -- what else is it, except about politics? And we would look to the exact same things that we look to in our consistent line of racial gerrymandering cases. I think my main point was that we just -- we do this, we -- we -- we -- we do it when we deal with racial gerrymandering cases, even if you want to say to me that this is no easier than that, I would say back -- I guess I would argue with that, but -- but my main point was even if it's no easier, we do it all the time. Well, we -- we would be looking at the same things. We would be looking at the same kind of direct evidence, the same kind of statements. We would be looking at the same circumstantial evidence that has to do with where the lines were drawn and how they were drawn. So it's -- it's all the same kind of evidence, isn't it? I guess -- I guess what I was suggesting was that we're looking to the same things to discover intent in each circumstance. ",but be your theory that that would be a compelling interest that could defeat strict scrutiny in other word the way i understand your theory be that you would put the state in that position to the test of of say this be a compelling interest this be the only way we can achieve that interest and and sort of put it through the strict scrutiny hoop even when the state you know want to achieve balanced district or want to undo a former gerrymander so you would still put the state through a very strict scrutiny test in that case but mr kimberly well may i give you a hypothetical that get to

2017,Ayestas v. Davis,114,Elena Kagan,"The things, the examples that you just gave to Sotomayor, is that why you think the word ""may"" is in the statute? What is the effect of that word? What is it covering and what discretion does it allow? But what -- And the finite means business is just to make sure that, like a reasonable attorney for Bill Gates, would scour the earth and not care about it. Uh-huh. If I could -- Well, Mr. Keller, if I can just -- I mean, suppose, this is the kind of language which routinely gives rise to circuit splits, you know, one circuit interprets it one way and a second another way and a third another way, and it can go on and on. And you're essentially saying that we have no way to decide which standard is the standard that Congress meant when it said this. So another circuit tomorrow could say, you know, we're just not giving any funds for any mitigation investigations at all under this standard, and we would be, like, whatever. (Laughter.) Well, take this case as an example, right? So it seems to me if a judge looks at this case, a judge would say: I -- look, I don't know what you're going to find in your investigation, and it's unreasonable for me to make a judgment about what you're going to find in your investigation because that's the whole point of an investigation. But I do know that here no social history was done at all and you've got like a schizophrenic defendant, somebody who has had a mental health diagnosis of a very serious order. Well, of course, that's the kind of thing that a reasonable attorney would investigate in determining how to spend their limited resources, isn't it? Putting aside whether those particular witnesses and what -- what -- what cross -- whether the -- and maybe just even putting those people aside, I mean, go and figure out whether there's a history of mental health issues. Yes, but I know, you know, if you have a -- a person who has since the incident in question been diagnosed as schizophrenic, you know, some bell goes off that says I think maybe we should do some investigation and try to figure out whether he was suffering from mental health issues at the time of the incident. I mean, what better purposes would you spend this money on? It seems to me in this case, it's like the only thing you want to spend your money on is a mitigation investigation. There's nothing else, really, to spend your money on. But, Mr. Keller, this is the language that Martinez used. Martinez said that these sorts of claims often require investigative work. It said, I'm quoting again, ""they depend on evidence outside the trial record."" So the whole exception that Martinez set out, you know, seems to be premised on the idea that there's an opportunity to develop the factual basis for the IAT -- IATC claim. Well, we said all this. It often requires investigative work and it depends on evidence outside the trial record, and now you're saying we'll just take a look at this statute and say that of course it doesn't allow investigative work or evidence outside the trial record. I mean, this is precisely what we said. ",the thing the example that you just give to sotomayor be that why you think the word may be in the statute what be the effect of that word what be it cover and what discretion do it allow but what and the finite mean business be just to make sure that like a reasonable attorney for bill gate would scour the earth and not care about it uh huh if i could well mr keller if i can just i mean suppose this be the kind of language which routinely give rise to circuit split you know one circuit interpret it one way and a second another way and a third another way and it can go on and on and you be essentially say that we have no way to decide which standard be the standard that congress mean when it say this so another circuit tomorrow could say you know we be just not give any fund for any mitigation investigation at all under this standard and we would be like whatever laughter well take this case as an example right so it seem to me if a judge look at this case a judge would say i look i do not know what you be go to find in your investigation and it be unreasonable for me to make a judgment about what you be go to find in your investigation because that be the whole point of an investigation but i do know that here no social history be do at all and you have get like a schizophrenic defendant somebody who have have a mental health diagnosis of a very serious order well of course that be the kind of thing that a reasonable attorney would investigate in determine how to spend their limited resource be not it put aside whether those particular witness and what what what cross whether the and maybe just even put those people aside i mean go and figure out whether there be a history of mental health issue yes but i know you know if you have a a person who have since the incident in question be diagnose as schizophrenic you know some bell go off that say i think maybe we should do some investigation and try to figure out whether he be suffer from mental health issue at the time of the incident i mean what good purpose would you spend this money on it seem to me in this case it be like the only thing you want to spend your money on be a mitigation investigation there be nothing else really to spend your money on but mr keller this be the language that martinez use martinez say that these sort of claim often require investigative work it say I be quote again they depend on evidence outside the trial record so the whole exception that martinez set out you know seem to be premise on the idea that there be an opportunity to develop the factual basis for the iat iatc claim well we say all this it often require investigative work and it depend on evidence outside the trial record and now you be say we will just take a look at this statute and say that of course it do not allow investigative work or evidence outside the trial record i mean this be precisely what we say ,187.08,Roberts Court,"Oct 30, 2017",Carlos Manuel Ayestas,"Lorie Davis, Director, Texas Department of Criminal Justice (Institutional Division)",16-6795,"Apr 3, 2017","Mar 21, 2018",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2017,Trump v. Hawaii,114,Elena Kagan,"May I turn, General, to the constitutional claims in this case? And your principal response to the Establishment Clause claim is to cite Mandel and to say that, once the government comes forward with a legitimate reason -- of course, national security is the most important reason one can come forward with -- the game is over, essentially. And I just want to press on that a little bit. So, first, I want to ask whether that means -- you started off by talking a lot about the process of this proclamation. But I -- I take it that that argument would apply irrespective of what process was used. In other words, you would have made the same Mandel argument to the first executive order in this case, or would you not? Well, I guess I wonder why that is, just because, when I read Mandel, I don't see anything about process or you have to meet a certain kind of bar. Mandel really is kind of you state a reason and this Court stops. So let me give you a hypothetical, and it's just -- you know, I think that there are ways to distinguish Mandel in this case, but -- but -- but, you know, just in terms of thinking about what Mandel really forecloses here. I agree. So this is a hypothetical that you've heard a variant of before that the government has, at any rate, but I want to just give you. So let's say in some future time a -- a President gets elected who is a vehement anti-Semite -- -- and says all kinds of denigrating comments about Jews and provokes a lot of resentment and hatred over the course of a campaign and in his presidency and, in the course of that, asks his staff or his cabinet members to issue a proc -- to issue recommendations so that he can issue a proclamation of this kind, and they dot all the i's and they cross all the t's. And what emerges -- and, again, in the context of this virulent anti-Semitism -- what emerges is a proclamation that says no one shall enter from Israel. Do you say Mandel puts an end to judicial review of that set of facts? Well, the question is -- Well -- Yes. General, I'm -- let's -- this is a out-of-the-box kind of President in my hypothetical. And -- (Laughter.) And -- and, you know, he thinks that there are good diplomatic reasons, and there might -- who knows what the future holds, that there might be good diplomatic reasons to put pressure on Israel or to say we want Israel to vote a certain way in the U.N. and this is a way to better our diplomatic hand, and so this is what he does. And -- and who knows what his heart of hearts is. I mean, I take that point. But the question is not really what his heart of hearts is. The question is what are reasonable observers to think -- -- given this context, in which this hypothetical President -- -- is making virulent anti-Semitic comments. You -- you said something earlier, General, I want to make sure that I got it right. You said if at the time the President had said we don't want Muslims coming into this country -- -- that that would undermine the proclamation. Did I get you right? So I -- I think, you know, honestly, the difference here then seems to be is everything that the President said effectively that? Well, you might think -- I -- I guess the question, though, Mr. Katyal, is maybe you're entirely right that 1182(f) needs to have some limits to prevent the President from doing something that's completely contrary to another section of the statute. But you're suggesting, well, the President can't do anything that's not contemplated by the rest of the statute. Okay. So then I want to know, what are you saying this is directly contrary to? Because it seems to me you would have to point to some kind of clear and direct conflict -- -- between what the President is doing and another statutory provision. And -- and yet, Mr. Katyal, you have a proclamation that says there are important national security interests at stake. And the question is how to do the kind of analysis that you want us to do without in some sense evaluating the adequacy of those national security interests, which for the most part we've said courts are not equipped to do. ",may i turn general to the constitutional claim in this case and your principal response to the establishment clause claim be to cite mandel and to say that once the government come forward with a legitimate reason of course national security be the most important reason one can come forward with the game be over essentially and i just want to press on that a little bit so first i want to ask whether that mean you start off by talk a lot about the process of this proclamation but i i take it that that argument would apply irrespective of what process be use in other word you would have make the same mandel argument to the first executive order in this case or would you not well i guess i wonder why that be just because when i read mandel i do not see anything about process or you have to meet a certain kind of bar mandel really be kind of you state a reason and this court stop so let me give you a hypothetical and it be just you know i think that there be way to distinguish mandel in this case but but but you know just in term of think about what mandel really foreclose here i agree so this be a hypothetical that you have hear a variant of before that the government have at any rate but i want to just give you so let us say in some future time a a president get elect who be a vehement anti semite and say all kind of denigrate comment about jew and provoke a lot of resentment and hatred over the course of a campaign and in his presidency and in the course of that ask his staff or his cabinet member to issue a proc to issue recommendation so that he can issue a proclamation of this kind and they dot all the i s and they cross all the t s and what emerges and again in the context of this virulent anti semitism what emerge be a proclamation that say no one shall enter from israel do you say mandel put an end to judicial review of that set of fact well the question be well yes general I be let us this be a out of the box kind of president in my hypothetical and laughter and and you know he think that there be good diplomatic reason and there might who know what the future hold that there might be good diplomatic reason to put pressure on israel or to say we want israel to vote a certain way in the youn and this be a way to better our diplomatic hand and so this be what he do and and who know what his heart of heart be i mean i take that point but the question be not really what his heart of heart be the question be what be reasonable observer to think give this context in which this hypothetical president be make virulent anti semitic comment you you say something earlier general i want to make sure that i get it right you say if at the time the president have say we do not want muslim come into this country that that would undermine the proclamation do i get you right so i i think you know honestly the difference here then seem to be be everything that the president say effectively that well you might think i i guess the question though mr katyal be maybe you be entirely right that f need to have some limit to prevent the president from do something that be completely contrary to another section of the statute but you be suggest well the president can not do anything that be not contemplate by the rest of the statute okay so then i want to know what be you say this be directly contrary to because it seem to me you would have to point to some kind of clear and direct conflict between what the president be do and another statutory provision and and yet mr katyal you have a proclamation that say there be important national security interest at stake and the question be how to do the kind of analysis that you want us to do without in some sense evaluate the adequacy of those national security interest which for the most part we have say court be not equip to do ,281.0399999999999,Roberts Court,"Apr 25, 2018","Donald J.

2017,"Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, Council 31",114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Messenger, may I ask you about reliance interests here? I don't think that we have ever overruled a case where reliance interests are remotely as strong as they are here. So just a few things to put on the table. Twenty-three states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, all would have their statutes declared unconstitutional at once. Thousands of municipalities would have contracts invalidated. Those contracts probably cover millions, maybe up to over 10 million, workers. So property and contract rights, the -- the -- the -- the statutes of many states and the livelihoods of millions of individuals affected all at once. When have we ever done something like that? What would be the justification for doing something like that? But that would be to flip our usual stare decisis doctrine. Our usual stare decisis doctrine makes it quite clear that reliance is an important consideration on the scales. Well, why is that? How many of these contracts have severability clauses, do you know? Of course, even if that's true, presumably they're bargained-for provisions. The contract would have been different if the unions and the employers had known that this was going to be declared unconstitutional. So to leave the contract as is, except for one particular bargained-for provision, is to do something that's inequitable for the union. Please. General, an important part of Mr. Messenger's argument is the idea that all speech about employment conditions, about pay, about vacation, you know, about all of the various employee benefits that -- that are subjects of collective bargaining, that are really the heart of collective bargaining, that all speech about that is -- are matters of public concern when it happens in the public workplace because they all cost money and, as taxpayers, we would be interested in things that cost money. Is that the government's position as well, that all of that speech is a matter of public concern? Can I ask -- it strikes me as a very unusual position for the government to be taking, looking after the long-term interests of the United States government, because essentially what that means is that you will have to litigate all employee/employer disputes under the -- -- second step of Pickering rather than under the first -- -- which is quite a striking thing for the government to be saying that it agrees with. So you're saying that when a union collectively bargains, it's a matter of public concern but that if employees in their workplace, 10 or 20 of them, get together without the formal collective bargaining that a union does, that that's not a matter of public concern? Well, that union is a representative of the employees and has been chosen to represent the employees so that the employees can better wield their power -- -- over terms and conditions of employment. So why should it matter -- I mean, that's -- I'm -- I'm trying to understand this because it struck me as a quite amazing thing -- -- for the government to be saying that these were matters of public concern. Why should it matter if 50 employees get together and say we want higher wages and then, on the other hand, if employees get together and say, you know what, we think it's right to elect a union so that the union can say that, it's the exact same subjects and the exact same speech that's going to be involved. Mr. -- Mr. Franklin, Mr. Messenger has suggested, and -- and -- and General Francisco, that if we overruled Abood, things would in a few years get back to normal. The state would pass a new statute, and these municipal contracts would all be renegotiated, and it wouldn't be any real issue. So could you -- what do you think about that? What would the difficulties be, if any, if the state -- if -- if the Court were to overrule Abood? Mr. -- Mr. Franklin, I mean, you just addressed what you considered to be the harmful effects of a different rule, but I was trying to get at a slightly different question. I was asking you, even beyond that, what are the effects on -- given that this rule has been in place for so long? If I understood -- Mr. Frederick, if I understood General Francisco's argument, it's that speech as to matters of pay and benefits and employment conditions and so forth are matters of public concern when they are addressed in a collective bargaining framework but are not matters of public concern when they are addressed outside of a collective bargaining framework by individual employees. Tell -- tell me about that. What do you think of that? ",mr messenger may i ask you about reliance interest here i do not think that we have ever overrule a case where reliance interest be remotely as strong as they be here so just a few thing to put on the table twenty three state the district of columbia puerto rico all would have their statute declare unconstitutional at once thousand of municipality would have contract invalidate those contract probably cover million maybe up to over million worker so property and contract right the the the the statute of many state and the livelihood of million of individual affect all at once when have we ever do something like that what would be the justification for do something like that but that would be to flip our usual stare decisis doctrine our usual stare decisis doctrine make it quite clear that reliance be an important consideration on the scale well why be that how many of these contract have severability clause do you know of course even if that be true presumably they be bargain for provision the contract would have be different if the union and the employer have know that this be go to be declare unconstitutional so to leave the contract as be except for one particular bargain for provision be to do something that be inequitable for the union please general an important part of mr messenger s argument be the idea that all speech about employment condition about pay about vacation you know about all of the various employee benefit that that be subject of collective bargaining that be really the heart of collective bargaining that all speech about that be be matter of public concern when it happen in the public workplace because they all cost money and as taxpayer we would be interested in thing that cost money be that the government s position as well that all of that speech be a matter of public concern can i ask it strike me as a very unusual position for the government to be take look after the long term interest of the united state government because essentially what that mean be that you will have to litigate all employeeemployer dispute under the second step of pickering rather than under the first which be quite a striking thing for the government to be say that it agree with so you be say that when a union collectively bargain it be a matter of public concern but that if employee in their workplace or of them get together without the formal collective bargaining that a union do that that be not a matter of public concern well that union be a representative of the employee and have be choose to represent the employee so that the employee can better wield their power over term and condition of employment so why should it matter i mean that be I be I be try to understand this because it strike me as a quite amazing thing for the government to be say that these we be matter of public concern why should it matter if employee get together and say we want high wage and then on the other hand if employee get together and say you know what we think it be right to elect a union so that the union can say that it be the exact same subject and the exact same speech that be go to be involve mr mr franklin mr messenger have suggest and and and general francisco that if we overrule abood thing would in a few year get back to normal the state would pass a new statute and these municipal contract would all be renegotiate and it would not be any real issue so could you what do you think about that what would the difficulty be if any if the state if if the court we be to overrule abood mr mr franklin i mean you just address what you consider to be the harmful effect of a different rule but i be try to get at a slightly different question i be ask you even beyond that what be the effect on give that this rule have be in place for so long if i understood mr frederick if i understand general francisco s argument it be that speech as to matter of pay and benefit and employment condition and so forth be matter of public concern when they be address in a collective bargaining framework but be not matter of public concern when they be addressed outside of a collective bargaining framework by individual employee tell tell me about that what do you think of that ,302.16,Roberts Court,"Feb 26, 2018",Mark Janus,"American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, Council 31, et al.",16-1466,"Sep 28, 2017","Jun 27, 2018",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2017,"Lozman v. City of Riviera Beach, Florida",114,Elena Kagan,"You -- you said, Ms. Karlan, that this would not -- never apply. You think that in serious crimes this would never get to a jury. Did I -- did I mishear you? Why is that? Do you think it would be appropriate for us to say something, if we were to rule in your client's favor, that with respect to felonies, this -- this should -- we don't expect this to go to juries much, if at all? But serious crimes. So I think, Ms. Karlan, that the -- the reference in Reichle that Justice Breyer was referring to talks about swift on-the-spot decisions where the safety of persons is in jeopardy. Is that the sort of language that you think would be appropriate to -- -- guard against the kind of hypotheticals that Justice Breyer and Justice Kennedy are talking about? Mr. Dvoretzky, I want to give you an opportunity to address each of your four if you want, but -- but if I may say, I mean, Ms. Karlan was having some difficulty with hypotheticals. But you might have some difficulty with the facts of your case. So if I could -- (Laughter.) -- move you to the facts of your case and suggest the kind of dangers that it poses, which is that in a local government, there are people who become real sort of pains to local officials, and -- and local officials want to retaliate against them, for all the various things they say, charging corruption, doing whatever Mr. Lozman did. I'm sure that there's one in every town. And just the nature of our lives and the nature of our criminal statute books, there's a lot to be arrested for. (Laughter.) So you follow somebody around and they commit a traffic violation of a pretty minor kind, and all of a sudden you're sitting in jail for 48 hours before they decide to release you. So that's a pretty big problem, it seems to me, and it's right here in kind of the facts of this case. So I guess I'd like you to respond to that. Mr. Wall, we allow people to sue under 1983 for discriminatory arrests under the equal protection clause and without showing anything about whether probable cause exists or not. What has been the experience with respect to those cases? And why is this area -- why should the rule be any different than that one? But one reason they -- One reason they are different is because, in Hartman, you had an indictment and you just looked at the indictment and said: Is there probable cause for that or not? I mean, here we have this ridiculous spectacle of going through the statute books for a month, trying to find something that this man may have violated. And there's just got to be a big difference between those two inquiries. Mr. Wall, you keep on saying one-in-a-thousand, but might there not be a problem that now that we have this case and we have to decide this case, and if we decide it your way, you know, maybe it's a green light to everybody to make it not the one-in-a-thousand case and to start really going -- you know, there are lots of small towns in America and there are lots of cranks in those small towns, and there are lots of relationships that go sour between officials and some members of the populace. And, you know, what about that? What about, you know, finding that guy every time he doesn't quite stop when he makes a right on red and putting him in jail for a while? ",you you say ms karlan that this would not never apply you think that in serious crime this would never get to a jury do i do i mishear you why be that do you think it would be appropriate for us to say something if we we be to rule in your client s favor that with respect to felony this this should we do not expect this to go to jury much if at all but serious crime so i think ms karlan that the the reference in reichle that justice breyer be refer to talk about swift on the spot decision where the safety of person be in jeopardy be that the sort of language that you think would be appropriate to guard against the kind of hypothetical that justice breyer and justice kennedy be talk about mr dvoretzky i want to give you an opportunity to address each of your four if you want but but if i may say i mean ms karlan be have some difficulty with hypothetical but you might have some difficulty with the fact of your case so if i could laughter move you to the fact of your case and suggest the kind of danger that it pose which be that in a local government there be people who become real sort of pain to local official and and local official want to retaliate against them for all the various thing they say charge corruption do whatever mr lozman do I be sure that there be one in every town and just the nature of our life and the nature of our criminal statute book there be a lot to be arrest for laughter so you follow somebody around and they commit a traffic violation of a pretty minor kind and all of a sudden you be sit in jail for hour before they decide to release you so that be a pretty big problem it seem to me and it be right here in kind of the fact of this case so i guess I would like you to respond to that mr wall we allow people to sue under for discriminatory arrest under the equal protection clause and without show anything about whether probable because exists or not what have be the experience with respect to those case and why be this area why should the rule be any different than that one but one reason they one reason they be different be because in hartman you have an indictment and you just look at the indictment and say be there probable because for that or not i mean here we have this ridiculous spectacle of go through the statute book for a month try to find something that this man may have violate and there be just get to be a big difference between those two inquiry mr wall you keep on say one in a thousand but might there not be a problem that now that we have this case and we have to decide this case and if we decide it your way you know maybe it be a green light to everybody to make it not the one in a thousand case and to start really go you know there be lot of small town in america and there be lot of crank in those small town and there be lot of relationship that go sour between official and some member of the populace and you know what about that what about you know find that guy every time he do not quite stop when he make a right on red and put him in jail for a while ,210.55,Roberts Court,"Feb 27, 2018",Fane Lozman,"The City of Riviera Beach, Florida",17-21,"Nov 13, 2017","Jun 18, 2018",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2017,Patchak v. Zinke,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Gant, when -- when you say ""directed that a case shall be dismissed,"" are you referring only to the last few words of this statute or are you referring more broadly? Right. ""And shall be promptly dismissed."" Are you suggesting that if those five words were not in the statute, that the case would come out differently? But -- but if you had 2(b), finished, just ""shall not be filed or maintained in a Federal court,"" full stop, you're saying that would be the same statute as the one we actually have? Yeah. Well, if that's so, I mean, I thought that you were suggesting a rule that said, well, when you direct one case, that's unconstitutional, but now you've just said you're not saying that. So, again, coming back to Justice Alito's question, I mean, we know that Congress can alter the jurisdiction of the federal courts. And we know that Congress can alter that jurisdiction and apply it to pending cases. We've said that over and over again. So what makes -- what would make this unconstitutional if we assumed that this is a jurisdiction-stripping statute? Well, the law is the jurisdictional law. That's what Congress is changing. Congress is changing jurisdiction. In so doing, Congress is changing the law. We haven't said Congress has to change, you know, substantive law. Here Congress is changing jurisdictional law. It's saying, you know, yesterday you had jurisdiction over a certain category of cases. Today you don't. Now, why is that unconstitutional or when is that unconstitutional? I don't think that's the question, Mr. Gant. I think the question is, and this was what I started with, would you be making the same constitutional argument if the last five words were not there? And I took you to say, yes, you would be making the same constitutional argument, and in so doing, you separated yourself from your amici because I understand your amici, as Justice Gorsuch does, as saying that everything hangs on that last five words. And you're suggesting that not everything hangs on that last five words, that you would have the exact same constitutional objections if those five words weren't in the picture. Do I have you right? It's like bad atmospherics? But then you do get, again, and I think that this is the underlying premise of Justice Gorsuch's question, so take out the last five words, and you were trying to explain why what then just seems a jurisdiction-stripping statute is unconstitutional, in that -- against the backdrop of very consistent precedent that we have that says that Congress can take away the jurisdiction of the federal courts and can do so in a way that affects pending cases. And -- and so why and when is that unconstitutional? Mr. Gant, could I -- I'm sorry to drag you around like this, but the Chief Justice asked you a question and you indicated that you agreed with his understanding of when a jurisdictional statute violated the Constitution, and -- and then you were interrupted. I just want to hear a little bit more about what you think of his question. Well, I'm interested in that question, the Chief Justice's question, because he gave you a theory; you said yes. But what does that mean, ""yes""? Yes why? So why -- why is it substantially similar to that situation? That makes it sound like it's because it's about a single case, but you said that that wasn't your theory. So what is your theory? But doesn't Congress always do that when it strips the federal courts of jurisdiction over a category of cases? Because we have said that that applies to pending suits. So I guess the question is: Why aren't you saying that every time we said that, we were wrong; that any time Congress changes the jurisdiction of the federal court and then applies to pending cases, that that's a separation-of-powers issue? Well, it's certain -- I'm sorry. Your light's on. Fine. I was just following up on Justice Alito's because you -- you say directing the outcome of these cases, but any time Congress jurisdiction strips, and that applies to pending cases, it does direct the outcome of those cases. Once upon a time those cases could proceed. Now they can't. So Congress is directing the outcome of those cases in some sense that we've consistently held to be perfectly fine. We might have been wrong in saying that's perfectly fine, but we've said it a lot of times. Well, what if it were? What -- what if they -- the Congress had said the Secretary's decision to make the Bradley Property is confirmed, and David Patchak's suit shall not be maintained and shall be dismissed. Well, what's the difference between -- Is there a difference between Smith wins and there's no jurisdiction over Jones's suit? And, therefore, Smith wins? I guess I don't understand, Mr. Shah, how that helps you. I mean, doesn't this just exclude the power of the federal courts? I -- I see. Got it. Could I ask you to -- Ms. O'Connell said when you were looking at that -- if you had a piece of legislation that said in Jones v. Smith, Smith loses, that that would be unconstitutional. And she has to say that because nine of us said it. So then the question is why is it different -- -- if Congress instead says in Jones v. Smith, there shall be no jurisdiction, and Smith loses. Why -- why is that different? In Jones v. Smith, there shall be no jurisdiction -- -- and ergo, Smith loses. I don't think Smith much cares. Why would Smith care? I guess I'm -- I'm not quite sure what you're reserving there, Mr. Shah, so here is a hypothetical. There's a very large corporation, commits a lot of employment discrimination. Because it does, it has a lot of employment discrimination suits filed against it. And so the CEO of this big corporation goes to Congress and says: These suits are getting to be a real hassle, and so I'd like a piece of legislation. And Congress says: Good enough, and it says there shall be no jurisdiction over any employment discrimination suits filed against that corporation. All right? And -- and -- and -- and -- and -- and in so doing, it knocks out all these employment litigation -- all these employment discrimination suits that have been filed against that corporation. Is that constitutional? So, if this had said just David Patchak's suit, different case? ",mr gant when when you say direct that a case shall be dismiss be you refer only to the last few word of this statute or be you refer more broadly right and shall be promptly dismiss be you suggest that if those five word we be not in the statute that the case would come out differently but but if you have b finish just shall not be file or maintain in a federal court full stop you be say that would be the same statute as the one we actually have yeah well if that be so i mean i think that you we be suggest a rule that say well when you direct one case that be unconstitutional but now you

2017,Hall v. Hall,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Simpson, I guess I don't understand your answer to Justice Sotomayor or Justice Ginsburg because, although this suit does present this different kind of issue, I took it that your argument would apply just as well to a suit in which somebody has five claims, splits them up into five different lawsuits. And you're saying that should be treated the same way that one claim with -- one suit with those five claims is. I -- I guess the -- the bigger point that I'm making is that it seems to me that your argument applies whenever there is consolidation of cases, regardless of exactly how those cases look and what's in them. Am I -- am I right about that, the breadth of your argument? Do you think -- Mr. -- Could you explain a little bit more how you're reading Rule 58? And that was what Justice Ginsburg asked you; is that right, when you said yes, it authorizes the court to do that. What -- how does it do that? May I ask you a different kind of question, Mr. Simpson? It just really goes back to the language here. I mean, would you agree that your understanding of what it means to consolidate cases is different from the ordinary meaning of that term? Well, suppose I said to you that a company was going to consolidate two offices. Are they going to have two offices or one office? So -- and it's not just laymen, right? I mean, if you look at Black's Law Dictionary, it says a consolidation in civil procedure, it defines as ""the court-ordered unification of two or more actions into a single action."" So that's the Black's Law Dictionary definition. Same thing. Two becomes one. I mean, it did. And -- and then, in Johnson, Johnson tells us that ""consolidate"" for the purpose of that predecessor statute did not mean a complete merger. So Johnson is very much on your side. But -- but Johnson was interpreting a statute which, although it similarly used the word ""consolidate,"" was different in other respects. And I'm wondering whether now that we're on a kind of blank slate, we have a new rule, it's different from the statute in a number of ways, why we have to keep on giving this quite unusual understanding of the word ""consolidate,"" why we have to keep on the same track; why we can't just say, you know what, ""consolidate"" means consolidate. It means two becomes one. Well, there is -- lots of courts say, look, we're going to consolidate for some purposes but not all purposes. And when a court does that, of course, it means something else. It means just segments of these two lawsuits are going to come together. But when a court says we're going to consolidate for all purposes, I mean, just the usual understanding of that is, okay, now we have one lawsuit in front of us. And that would have consequences as to what we think the final judgment is, when it comes, and when your appellate rights would kick in. I know. But where -- we kind of get to figure out what's right and what's wrong as to all these courts that are all confused. That's why we're here. Mr. -- Mr. Katyal -- And was that in the prior statute, Mr. Katyal, that 42(a)(1), which really does lead you to think about the term consolidation differently. Could you also add 42(a)(3)? Because 42(a)(1) is about, you know, joint hearings and trials. 42(a)(3) says, look, you can also issue any other kind of order you want to minimize delay. And then, separate from that, you have this consolidation provision. Well, Mr. Katyal, what do you think we should do if, on the one hand, we think your rule makes a lot of sense for cases that are consolidated completely for all purposes, but, on the other hand, we're concerned that this case should not have been? What should we do with that? It just does seem to me that many of the questions that have been put to you really do deal with the question of whether consolidation was proper here. ",mr simpson i guess i do not understand your answer to justice sotomayor or justice ginsburg because although this suit do present this different kind of issue i take it that your argument would apply just as well to a suit in which somebody have five claim split them up into five different lawsuit and you be say that should be treat the same way that one claim with one suit with those five claim be i i guess the the big point that I be make be that it seem to me that your argument apply whenever there be consolidation of case regardless of exactly how those case look and what be in them be i be i right about that the breadth of your argument do you think mr could you explain a little bit more how you be read rule and that be what justice ginsburg ask you be that right when you say yes it authorize the court to do that what how do it do that may i ask you a different kind of question mr simpson it just really go back to the language here i mean would you agree that your understanding of what it mean to consolidate case be different from the ordinary meaning of that term well suppose i say to you that a company be go to consolidate two office be they go to have two office or one office so and it be not just layman right i mean if you look at black s law dictionary it say a consolidation in civil procedure it define as the court order unification of two or more action into a single action so that be the black s law dictionary definition same thing two become one i mean it do and and then in johnson johnson tell us that consolidate for the purpose of that predecessor statute do not mean a complete merger so johnson be very much on your side but but johnson be interpret a statute which although it similarly use the word consolidate be different in other respect and I be wonder whether now that we be on a kind of blank slate we have a new rule it be different from the statute in a number of way why we have to keep on give this quite unusual understanding of the word consolidate why we have to keep on the same track why we can not just say you know what consolidate mean consolidate it mean two become one well there be lot of court say look we be go to consolidate for some purpose but not all purpose and when a court do that of course it mean something else it mean just segment of these two lawsuit be go to come together but when a court say we be go to consolidate for all purpose i mean just the usual understanding of that be okay now we have one lawsuit in front of us and that would have consequence as to what we think the final judgment be when it come and when your appellate right would kick in i know but where we kind of get to figure out what be right and what be wrong as to all these court that be all confused that be why we be here mr mr katyal and be that in the prior statute mr katyal that a which really do lead you to think about the term consolidation differently could you also add a because a be about you know joint hearing and trial a say look you can also issue any other kind of order you want to minimize delay and then separate from that you have this consolidation provision well mr katyal what do you think we should do if on the one hand we think your rule make a lot of sense for case that be consolidate completely for all purpose but on the other hand we be concern that this case should not have be what should we do with that it just do seem to me that many of the question that have be put to you really do deal with the question of whether consolidation be proper here ,249.44000000000003,Roberts Court,"Jan 16, 2018","Elsa Hall, as Personal Representative of the Estate of Ethlyn Louise Hall and as Successor Trustee of the Ethlyn Louise Hall Family Trust","Samuel H.

2017,District of Columbia v. Wesby,114,Elena Kagan,"Just to make sure I understand, Mr. Kim. The tip was a neighbor saying that home is supposed to be vacant and yet there's a party going on. It's not just a neighbor calling and saying there's a very loud party, it's disturbing my sleep. That the tippee, tipper -- that the tipper specifically said it's supposed to be vacant; is that correct? Multiple? Mr. Kim, could you tell me a little bit about how you think the summary judgment posture of this case does or doesn't matter? I mean, usually in summary judgment cases, we say we need to view the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. And many of these facts, you could see it one way or you could see it another way. It has one explanation or it has another explanation. So how does the summary judgment standard fit with the probable cause standard and also with the qualified immunity standard? How do those three things work together here? Mr. Parker -- -- you know, you're exactly right, that, of course, we have to view this through the eyes of the officer. And there is much that an officer could look at here and say, I think I have probable cause. And, certainly, when the qualified immunity standard is laid on top of that, makes it even easier for the officer. I guess one of the things that -- that strikes me as why there's resistance here, is that when looked at from the point of view of the reasonable partygoer, it looks a little bit different. And I -- I take the point that that's not the standard, but we are setting rules and those rules are going to affect how police officers act in the future as well. And when looked at from the reasonable partygoer's view, there are these parties that, once long ago, I used to be invited to -- (Laughter.) -- where you didn't -- don't know the host, but you know Joe is having a party. And can I say that long, long ago, marijuana was maybe present at those parties? And, you know, so -- and, you know, it just is not obvious that the reasonable partygoer is supposed to walk into this apartment and say: Got to get out of here. And -- and it seems a little bit hard that they're subject to arrest. So -- so how do I think about that question? Right, but they don't know that, as I said. I mean, from the partygoers' point of view, they just know that Joe is having a big party, and it's a good time, and -- and maybe there will be some liquor and maybe there will be some recreational drugs. And -- and they're having a good time. Well, Mr. Garrett, as you say, it is an objective standard. And there are all these cases in the District of Columbia; Tillman is the one that gets the most emphasis in the briefs, but there are others, right? There's this Artisst, Smith, McGloin, Bowman. And all of these cases, which are D.C. court cases, say if they upheld convictions, they upheld convictions for trespass, even though the person gave some excuse about how they didn't know or they didn't -- or they -- and they -- and they shouldn't -- they had no reason to know that they were there. And I'm -- I'm just wondering, you're a D.C. police officer and there are all these cases that say, you know, we're going to uphold convictions even though people like the partygoers here have -- get up on the stand and say: This is why I thought I had a right to be here. And, you know, what is a police officer supposed to make of all that law? Are all the others unlawful entry statutes? Mr. Kim, realizing that this is not the legal question before us, I'm just curious as to what your answer is. If you were giving counsel to the Police Department, and they said in a situation like this what should we do, a very different question from the legal question before us, but what would be the answer to that question? These -- these -- it's these circumstances. ",just to make sure i understand mr kim the tip be a neighbor say that home be suppose to be vacant and yet there be a party go on it be not just a neighbor call and say there be a very loud party it be disturb my sleep that the tippee tipper that the tipper specifically say it be suppose to be vacant be that correct multiple mr kim could you tell me a little bit about how you think the summary judgment posture of this case do or do not matter i mean usually in summary judgment case we say we need to view the fact in the light most favorable to the non move party and many of these fact you could see it one way or you could see it another way it have one explanation or it have another explanation so how do the summary judgment standard fit with the probable because standard and also with the qualified immunity standard how do those three thing work together here mr parker you know you be exactly right that of course we have to view this through the eye of the officer and there be much that an officer could look at here and say i think i have probable because and certainly when the qualify immunity standard be lay on top of that make it even easier for the officer i guess one of the thing that that strike me as why there be resistance here be that when look at from the point of view of the reasonable partygoer it look a little bit different and i i take the point that that be not the standard but we be set rule and those rule be go to affect how police officer act in the future as well and when look at from the reasonable partygoer s view there be these party that once long ago i use to be invite to laughter where you do not do not know the host but you know joe be have a party and can i say that long long ago marijuana be maybe present at those party and you know so and you know it just be not obvious that the reasonable partygoer be suppose to walk into this apartment and say get to get out of here and and it seem a little bit hard that they be subject to arrest so so how do i think about that question right but they do not know that as i say i mean from the partygoer point of view they just know that joe be have a big party and it be a good time and and maybe there will be some liquor and maybe there will be some recreational drug and and they be have a good time well mr garrett as you say it be an objective standard and there be all these case in the district of columbia tillman be the one that get the most emphasis in the brief but there be others right there be this artisst smith mcgloin bowman and all of these case which be dc court case say if they uphold conviction they uphold conviction for trespass even though the person give some excuse about how they do not know or they do not or they and they and they should not they have no reason to know that they we be there and I be I be just wondering you be a dc police officer and there be all these case that say you know we be go to uphold conviction even though people like the partygoer here have get up on the stand and say this be why i thought i have a right to be here and you know what be a police officer suppose to make of all that law be all the others unlawful entry statute mr kim realize that this be not the legal question before us I be just curious as to what your answer be if you we be give counsel to the police department and they say in a situation like this what should we do a very different question from the legal question before us but what would be the answer to that question these these it be these circumstance ,249.36000000000004,Roberts Court,"Oct 4, 2017","District of Columbia, et al.","Theodore Wesby, et al.",15-1485,"Jan 19, 2017","Jan 22, 2018",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2017,Sveen v. Melin,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Unikowsky -- -- on the retroactivity point, here, the statute precedes both the divorce and the death. But what would happen if the divorce happened first and then the enactment of the statute and then the death? Would the statute have applied? Please. So this might be an unfair question, but one of the things that struck me in reading your brief and now in listening to you, it's a -- it's an unusual thing we see in your brief, this kind of we have five arguments in varying levels. You know, it's -- it's the police power; it's not a contractual obligation; it's not an impairment at all; it's not a substantial impairment; maybe it is, but it's justified. Did I get all those five right? Really, which one do you think? Because -- (Laughter.) -- you know, you're answering some of our questions like, oh, that's an answer from column 1. And no, now I can give you an answer from column 3. But when we have to decide this case, we presumably have to pick one. And if we were to go with you, I mean, where do you really think that the -- this -- this is -- the question is here? Well, that might be true -- I'm sorry to -- that might be true if the divorce preceded the statute, right, because, presumably, the time when even an inattentive person is going to come upon this problem is when the divorce occurs. And as long as the divorce is subsequent to the statute, I don't see how you can make that argument. But, Mr. Dvoretzky, if I could come back to Justice Alito's question because, in answering Justice Alito, you say we don't look to Mr. Sveen in particular, even if we know a lot about him. We look to this broad class of people who are in this situation. And if that's true -- I mean, I guess I had sort of conceptualized your argument as the exact opposite. Well, we don't know anything about Mr. Sveen, so even if it's true that people generally want to give their life insurance policy to their children, that doesn't matter because we don't know that about Mr. Sveen. But if you're saying: Really, we look to the broad class of people, then why shouldn't the broad class of people that we look to be -- you know, why shouldn't we make the same judgment that the -- or -- that the legislature made or at least accept that judgment that if we look to the broad class of people, most of them would rather give their life insurance policy to their children than to the -- their divorced spouse? Well, but you just said we're not -- I mean, if -- if -- if the question is the class, rather than the individual, then what option do we have other than to say something in general about the class?

2017,Upper Skagit Indian Tribe v. Lundgren,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, Mr. Hawkins -- Mr. Hawkins, I mean, I guess the question is, what is sovereign immunity and what does it entail? Even beyond the footnote in Bay Mills that the Chief Justice referenced, I think when you look at language of the kind that appears in Bay Mills and in other cases, what -- which says that, you know, if Congress wants to change it, it's up to Congress to change it, but the question is, what is the ""it""? In other words, what's up to Congress to change is deviations from the general law of sovereign immunity. And I think what the Lundgrens are saying here is that this is not part of the general law of sovereign immunity. And this goes back to Justice Ginsburg's question, that sovereign immunity typically, by common law and historically, includes this exception for immovable property. And so that's the baseline. It's, well, sovereign immunity, as it historically exists, except as it historically exists, it just didn't include immunity from suits that related to immovable property. But I thought that we explained in Kiowa that foreign sovereign immunity actually started as a judicial doctrine. It was only later that it was taken over by the political branches. But if you look at two cases, Ms. O'Connell, one is Schooner Exchange, which talks about foreign states, and then the other is this Georgia v. Chattanooga, which is individual states in another state's jurisdiction, I mean, both of those seem to be indicating that there's this long-standing rule that when the prince goes someplace else and buys land there, he's just going to be treated like anybody else. And it doesn't have much to do with any kind of executive action. It doesn't have much to do with the states all agreeing about something at the Constitutional Convention. It's just a sort of rule that when the prince pops up in some other jurisdiction and buys a piece of land, he's no longer the prince. I guess what my point is -- is not whether it should be denominated an exception or not an exception but whether this is the kind of historic, traditional, long-standing rule that we -- we shouldn't expect Congress to have to put in, that it just sort of goes into the doctrine because that is part of the doctrine from long, long ago, which is a very different thing from saying, look, it's up to Congress to really -- to -- to treat -- you know, to -- to -- to start modifying terms of the doctrine that have existed for a long time. I don't think that -- -- that's quite true, Mr. Miller, unless -- I mean, tell me if I'm wrong, but I made a little Venn diagram for myself, and it turns out that immovable property and in rem jurisdiction, there's a large sphere of overlap, but there are definitely places where the two do not overlap. So, you know, you have your in rem about land, that's this sphere of overlap, but you can have immovable property that the action is about land and have an in personam suit, that -- tjat would be a typical trespass, something like that. And then, on the other side, you could have an in rem suit that's about movable property or you could have an in rem suit that's about land within the jurisdiction. And that would not fall within the sphere -- with -- excuse me, within the reservation itself, within the Indian reservation, and that would not fall within the sphere of overlap. So I think that there are real differences in the scope of the immovable property exception on the one hand and an in rem exception on the other hand. And -- and, clearly, the Washington court talked about the in rem exception. Now you're coming in and you have an extremely strong argument about this immovable property rule, but it's not the same argument that the court in Washington made. It's not the same theory as Justice Gorsuch pointed out. It's also just not the same categorization. Even if it's land -- -- there's still a question of where is the land, is the land on the reservation or is the land outside the reservation? If the land is on the reservation, I took you to agree with the point that that's the prince's land, and so the prince would be immune from suit. I guess what I'm saying is that it becomes much -- a -- a different question, a more complicated question if you ask about a broad in rem exception or, you know, in some ways the in rem exception is broader, in some ways it's narrower. It just becomes a different question if you ask about in rem exception, one which does take you into this question of: What happens if the land is on the reservation? Then, if you say: Look, under the immovable property rule, if one sovereign owns land in another sovereign's territory, that sovereign is subject to suit there. That's not -- that's not a general in rem question. It's a question about the immovable property rule. But Mr. -- this is the way I sort of see what's happened in this case, and, again, you can tell me if I'm wrong. But you took over this case and you read this opinion and you said this is not a very good theory. (Laughter.) There is a really good theory here, and I'm going to make that. And that's what good lawyers do. I'm not at all criticizing you. It's just it's a new theory and a new -- it's not just even a new argument. It's just a new -- it's a completely new way to win this case. Did that happen because you had a conversation with the Solicitor General -- (Laughter.) -- in which the Solicitor General knew which sort of arguments you were going to make? Yeah, I mean, as I said, I -- I think you have a -- a pretty strong, not -- you know, it looks pretty good to me right now. (Laughter.) I -- I -- I am a little bit worried about what Justice Sotomayor said, which is, you know -- you know, if we really looked harder, maybe there would be something else that would cut against this theory. I'm a little bit worried that there aren't amici who knew about this theory. The only one who did is really the Solicitor General, because the Solicitor General generally talks to parties as the litigation goes forward. And I think it would be, I have to say, just a bad way of dealing on our part if we allowed parties to come in, even with the best of faith, and said I have a new theory for you that -- that really the only people who got a chance to reply are the Petitioners in a 20-page yellow brief. ",well mr hawkins mr hawkins i mean i guess the question be what be sovereign immunity and what do it entail even beyond the footnote in bay mill that the chief justice reference i think when you look at language of the kind that appear in bay mill and in other case what which say that you know if congress want to change it it be up to congress to change it but the question be what be the it in other word what be up to congress to change be deviation from the general law of sovereign immunity and i think what the lundgrens be say here be that this be not part of the general law of sovereign

2017,National Association of Manufacturers v. Department of Defense,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Bishop, could I step back just for a bit? I mean, I understand that your basic argument is the list is the list and what's on the list controls. But if I said to you what was Congress's theory behind the list, do you think Congress had one? So your basic view is, look, you should just resign yourself to thinking of this as having no particular rationale. Congress said what it said. Nobody can figure out what the reasons are that Congress included those things and not other things. It's all a themeless pudding and that's just what it is? Is that -- is that the idea? In the -- in the government's brief, they ask -- they say, well, what if we had just done it the following way? We, you know, issued a rule saying don't discharge -- you can't discharge more than a certain amount of a certain pollutant in these following waters. And just list the waters in the rule that says how much of the pollutant you can't discharge. And they say, under your rule, that would come out differently, but it shouldn't come out differently. So let me make sure I understand. On -- on -- on that rule, if the -- if somebody challenged that rule, where would it go? You -- you can't discharge more than X amount of Y pollutant in the following waters. Well, it's an effluent limitation, but you say it's not under 1311. So then it goes to the district court? Do you -- do you think general -- I mean, does your interpretation depend very much on a specific understanding of the word ""under""? In other words, you are reading this to say something like under the specific authority of Section 1311, 1312. But ""under"" is a kind of nebulous word. It doesn't say under the specific authority here. It just says ""under."" You might read ""under"" a little bit differently. You might read ""under"" to say something like limitations regulating actions taken under Sections 1311, 1312, et cetera. So why should we read ""under"" your way, rather than in some other way? But how about -- I take the point, but how about promulgating a limitation, regulating actions taken under 1311, 1312? If you did it that way, it would come out the government's way. Yes, but, on -- on the other hand, you yourself treat this rule as very much limiting your activities. It is a limitation on activities. It's combined with another limitation, to -- to say you can't discharge pollutants where you want to discharge pollutants, but it's very much part and parcel of the limitation that you're objecting to. Ms. -- So, Ms. Kovner -- So, Ms. Kovner -- Ms. -- Let's assume for -- for a moment that your view of any other limitation is right, that it's quite a broad phrase, but General Murphy, as I understood it -- him, made -- made a point that said, well, still, I mean, there's this under these following sections. And suppose he's right, that in the context of this whole provision, which starts out about ""promulgating limitations,"" that ""under"" is -- is best taken to mean under the specific authority of. So is -- do you have any argument that this rule was promulgated under the authority of Section 11, or was it pretty clearly promulgated under the authority of Section 1361? Now, in your own brief in responding to some other argument in a footnote, you say the CWA authorized the Administrator to issue the Clean Water Rule, and then you have a citation, and it gives 1361 as the authority for that. And that seems, you know, pretty right to me, that you were relying on general rule-making authority, rather than relying on the provision that talked about specific effluent restrictions. And -- and, Ms. Kovner, suppose that the -- the rule had restricted the class of ""waters of the United States"". Would that still count as a limitation under your view? ",mr bishop could i step back just for a bit i mean i understand that your basic argument be the list be the list and what be on the list control but if i say to you what be congress s theory behind the list do you think congress have one so your basic view be look you should just resign yourself to think of this as have no particular rationale congress say what it say nobody can figure out what the reason be that congress include those thing and not other thing it be all a themeless pudding and that be just what it be be that be that the idea in the in the government s brief they ask they say well what if we have just do it the follow way we you know issue a rule say do not discharge you can not discharge more than a certain amount of a certain pollutant in these following water and just list the water in the rule that say how much of the pollutant you can not discharge and they say under your rule that would come out differently but it should not come out differently so let me make sure i understand on on on that rule if the if somebody challenge that rule where would it go you you can not discharge more than x amount of y pollutant in the following water well it be an effluent limitation but you say it be not under so then it go to the district court do you do you think general i mean do your interpretation depend very much on a specific understanding of the word under in other word you be read this to say something like under the specific authority of section but under be a kind of nebulous word it do not say under the specific authority here it just say under you might read under a little bit differently you might read under to say something like limitation regulate action take under section et cetera so why should we read under your way rather than in some other way but how about i take the point but how about promulgate a limitation regulate action take under if you do it that way it would come out the government s way yes but on on the other hand you yourself treat this rule as very much limit your activity it be a limitation on activity it be combine with another limitation to to say you can not discharge pollutant where you want to discharge pollutant but it be very much part and parcel of the limitation that you be object to m so ms kovner so ms kovner m let us assume for for a moment that your view of any other limitation be right that it be quite a broad phrase but general murphy as i understand it him make make a point that say well still i mean there be this under these following section and suppose he be right that in the context of this whole provision which start out about promulgating limitation that under be be best take to mean under the specific authority of so be do you have any argument that this rule be promulgate under the authority of section or be it pretty clearly promulgate under the authority of section now in your own brief in respond to some other argument in a footnote you say the cwa authorize the administrator to issue the clean water rule and then you have a citation and it give as the authority for that and that seem you know pretty right to me that you we be rely on general rule make authority rather than rely on the provision that talk about specific effluent restriction and and ms kovner suppose that the the rule have restrict the class of water of the united state would that still count as a limitation under your view ,242.13,Roberts Court,"Oct 11, 2017",National Association of Manufacturers,"Department of Defense, et al.",16-299,"Jan 13, 2017","Jan 22, 2018",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

2017,"U.S. Bank National Association v. Village at Lakeridge, LLC",114,Elena Kagan,"Well, Mr. Cross -- -- if you take two different kinds of opinions. One says the test is an arm's length transaction. Here are the following considerations that we think should be applied in determining whether something is an arm's length transaction. And the second opinion says the test is arm's length transaction, doesn't talk about considerations or factors, just assumes that everybody knows what that arm's length is, and just says here are the facts in this case and then reaches a conclusion, well, this either is or isn't an arm's length transaction. Now, it seems to me that on the first case you would have a good reason for saying: Well, when the court tries to elaborate a test and considers factors and considerations, those things are more a part of the legal inquiry. But when the court just says here is our test, now here is the facts, and then reaches a conclusion, it seems like all of those facts, they're just facts. Well, sometimes there are tests that we think are better formulated at a certain level of generality. And then we want to, you know, do case-by-case-by-case analysis to figure out what exactly that test means and how it applies in particular circumstances. We don't think the right thing is to set out, you know, a more specific legal test. We think that it will be filled in by factual development. And that seems what this is, isn't it? Well, it's not really the legal test according to the Ninth Circuit, right? Because the -- the Ninth Circuit has the arm's length component of its legal test, but it also has this question whether the closeness of the relationship with the debtor is comparable to that of the enumerated insider classifications in the statute. And -- and how any particular set of facts does or does not meet that prong of the test does not seem much of a factual question. I mean, assume a particular set of facts that everybody agrees to. And then the question is: Well, is that sufficiently close that it's comparable to the enumerated insider classifications? That doesn't seem like any factual question I've ever heard of. But -- But one way of thinking of this is that once you have the facts and the facts are uncontested and you're trying to figure out whether those facts satisfy a given legal standard, here whether they are comparably close to the statutory insiders, that then -- what the court is then doing is trying to figure out how important each fact is, given the legal test. And that sounds like a legal inquiry to me or a -- or, you know, how important is this fact in terms of what we should be looking to, in terms of what the legal test is. But that seems easier to say about the arm's length part of the test than about the sufficiently close to a statutory insider part. So Ms. -- Ms. Goodspeed, in your brief, you put a lot of emphasis on the idea that the question of arm's length transaction is one of intent. And you just said again there what were the parties' motives. But suppose that was not true. Suppose that our understanding of what is or is not an arm's length transaction is more objective in character. Would your argument still carry the day? Does -- does the government have a view as to what the correct legal test is? ",well mr cross if you take two different kind of opinion one say the test be an arm s length transaction here be the following consideration that we think should be apply in determine whether something be an arm s length transaction and the second opinion say the test be arm s length transaction do not talk about consideration or factor just assume that everybody know what that arm s length be and just say here be the fact in this case and then reach a conclusion well this either be or be not an arm s length transaction now it seem to me that on the first case you would have a good reason for say well when the court try to elaborate a test and considers factor and consideration those thing be more a part of the legal inquiry but when the court just say here be our test now here be the fact and then reach a conclusion it seem like all of those fact they be just fact well sometimes there be test that we think be well formulate at a certain level of generality and then we want to you know do case by case by case analysis to figure out what exactly that test mean and how it apply in particular circumstance we do not think the right thing be to set out you know a more specific legal test we think that it will be fill in by factual development and that seem what this be be not it well it be not really the legal test accord to the ninth circuit right because the the ninth circuit have the arm s length component of its legal test but it also have this question whether the closeness of the relationship with the debtor be comparable to that of the enumerated insider classification in the statute and and how any particular set of fact do or do not meet that prong of the test do not seem much of a factual question i mean assume a particular set of fact that everybody agree to and then the question be well be that sufficiently close that it be comparable to the enumerate insider classification that do not seem like any factual question I have ever hear of but but one way of thinking of this be that once you have the fact and the fact be uncontested and you be try to figure out whether those fact satisfy a give legal standard here whether they be comparably close to the statutory insider that then what the court be then do be try to figure out how important each fact be give the legal test and that sound like a legal inquiry to me or a or you know how important be this fact in term of what we should be look to in term of what the legal test be but that seem easy to say about the arm s length part of the test than about the sufficiently close to a statutory insider part so ms ms goodspeed in your brief you put a lot of emphasis on the idea that the question of arm s length transaction be one of intent and you just say again there what we be the party motif but suppose that be not true suppose that our understanding of what be or be not an arm s length transaction be more objective in character would your argument still carry the day do do the government have a view as to what the correct legal test be ,223.11999999999995,Roberts Court,"Oct 31, 2017",U.S. Bank National Association,"Village at Lakeridge, LLC",15-1509,"Mar 27, 2017","Mar 5, 2018",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1

2017,"Digital Realty Trust, Inc. v. Somers",114,Elena Kagan,"But isn't that disjunction quite odd? Right? A typical anti-retaliation provision, you would think, well, if I report internally and I'm fired for it, then I get my protection. But here you're saying they don't get protection, except if they do something completely unrelated, they might have made a report to the SEC about a completely different topic, they might have made it 10 years earlier, and that's going to give them protection even though they haven't been fired for anything remotely to do with that. But if I could just -- I guess I just don't understand what the theory is. There are two employees, and they both internally report, and they're both fired. And one of them, tough luck, but the other one is going to get protection because he's filed a report with the SEC about some different matter entirely 10 years earlier. Why does he get extra protection? So, Mr. Michel, I do think that that's a real anomaly. And I -- I -- I also think if you really look at the way this statute came to be, it's quite possible the way this provision gets in very late in the game, that they didn't know that they'll -- they forgot about this definitional provision, and they were meaning it more in the ordinary language sense. But there you are, you have this definitional provision, and it says what it says. And it says it applies to this section. And you have to have a really, really severe anomaly to get over that.

2017,National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra,114,Elena Kagan,"But you're -- but you're saying that if there is a non-medical facility -- I mean, I don't want to put words in your mouth. This is a question. If there is a non-medical facility that the state has reason to think is a -- is telling women about only one set of options and not another set of options, but here, the case would be they're only telling women about abortion providers, and they're not telling women about other ways that they may be able to complete their pregnancy, that the state could not impose a requirement that that facility post a notice saying, in fact, there are many kinds of facilities in the world and some are abortion providers and some are crisis pregnancy centers and some are something else, that -- that that would not be permissible? I guess I'm not sure, licensed, unlicensed. You -- you were suggesting that everything turned on whether a medical procedure was going to be performed. And my hypothetical was designed to take out the medical procedure; in other words, this is a facility that just refers women, but it refers women only to abortion providers. And the state decides we don't want facilities that refer women only to abortion providers. We want facilities that will tell women about the full range of their options. And so the question is: Would a requirement that such a facility post a notice saying there actually are a lot of options and here's how you can access them, would that be unconstitutional? Mr. -- Mr. Farris, can I ask -- you've been pinning a lot when you've tried to distinguish Casey on the idea of informed consent. And certainly some of the requirements in Casey are informed consent in the way we would understand that, talking about the risks of various procedures, all the things that we want doctors to talk about when we go to them and seek medical care. But there were definitely requirements in Casey that don't have much to do with informed consent, as I've ever understood it. You know, the -- the -- the doctor having to inform patients about -- that medical assistance benefits may be available for childbirth in neonatal care, inform women that the father would be liable to pay child support. So those kinds of requirements, they -- they just don't seem to have much to do about informed consent. And they are, and this goes back to Justice Breyer's sauce for the goose point, they're really the exact flip side of the requirements in this case. So how am I supposed to think about that? Well, I realize that that's a factual difference, that there's a doctor in the room, and in one case, there's not, but these are not informed consent requirements. But, Mr. Wall, why -- go ahead. I'm sorry. But I think the question is why shouldn't there -- a state says, you know what, this is the regime we want. We want to say to family planning clinics that they should put up a poster saying we do family planning; we do not do adoption. And we want to say to crisis pregnancy centers, along the lines of Petitioners here, we do adoption; we do not do family planning or abortion. And -- and -- and -- and -- and the state thinks that would be a good system because, when a woman goes in to either one of these kinds of places, they'll know what's there and they'll know what's not there. And what -- why would that be problematic? There is a -- a sense when you read this statute, Mr. Klein, there's at least a question that arises as to whether this statute has been gerrymandered. So would you speak to that? Because if it has been gerrymandered, that's a serious issue. In other words, if, you know, it's like, look, we have these general disclosure requirements, but we don't really want to apply them generally, we just want to apply them to some speakers whose speech we don't much like. Well, could you say -- could you say a few words about how these boundaries came about? In other words, you have these various lines that the statute draws and then it has these exemptions. And what was the state thinking -- I mean, you know, and I realize that the state -- you know, there are lots of people who were thinking different things, but is there -- give me a little bit more about your theory of the case even as to why these exemptions exist and why these lines are drawn. You've been saying, well, we go where the problem is. But tell me how you knew where the problem was. Tell me how -- what you thought the problem actually was. What were you doing? What were you trying to do? I mean, one way to think about how a statute like this gets enacted is to say we're -- you know, we're really concerned that there are low-income women, don't have a lot of access to information, don't realize what all their options are, want to make sure in general and across the board that they get the best information that's available to them. Another way to think about what the problem is and how a statute like this comes about is more targeted. It's to say there are these crisis pregnancy centers all over California and we know that women just go into them and they don't realize what they are, and they're being subject to being misled and we think that this is a terrible problem. And it might be that the -- you know, that the state could legitimately view that as a problem. It's a much more targeted problem. Whether it's a problem or not, it's much more targeted than the first. And I guess what I'm asking is, is this the second kind of statute or is it the first kind of statute? Yeah. Yeah, I don't -- I don't even remember which was the first kind of statute anymore and which was the second kind of statute. But I was saying a state could really be responding to a sort of generalized -- a feeling that, in general, poor women don't have access to information, or a state could be responding to a -- a feeling that there are a particular kind of a center that is misleading women as to what they do and don't provide. And I can see this statute arising in either of those two ways, and wanted you to tell me why you thought it arose in the first way and not in the second. ",but you be but you be say that if there be a non medical facility i mean i do not want to put word in your mouth this be a question if there be a non medical facility that the state have reason to think be a be tell woman about only one set of option and not another set of option but here the case would be they be only tell woman about abortion provider and they be not tell woman about other way that they may be able to complete their pregnancy that the state could not impose a requirement that that facility post a notice say in fact there be many kind of facility in the world and some be

turn on whether a medical procedure be go to be perform and my hypothetical be design to take out the medical procedure in other word this be a facility that just refers woman but it refer woman only to abortion provider and the state decide we do not want facility that refer woman only to abortion provider we want facility that will tell woman about the full range of their option and so the question be would a requirement that such a facility post a notice say there actually be a lot of option and here s how you can access them would that be unconstitutional mr mr farris can i ask you have be pin a lot when you have try to distinguish casey on the idea of informed consent and certainly some of the requirement in casey be inform consent in the way we would understand that talk about the risk of various procedure all the thing that we want doctor to talk about when we go to them and seek medical care but there we be definitely requirement in casey that do not have much to do with

doctor in the room and in one case there be not but these be not inform consent requirement but mr wall why go ahead I be sorry but i think the question be why should not there a state say you know what this be the regime we want we want to say to family plan clinic that they should put up a poster say we do family planning we do not do adoption and we want to say to crisis pregnancy center along the line of petitioner here we do adoption we do not do family planning or abortion and and and and and the state think that would be a good system because when a woman go in to either one of

realize that the state you know there be lot of people who we be think different thing but be there give me a little bit more about your theory of the case even as to why these exemption exist and why these line be draw you have be say well we go where the problem be but tell me how you know where the problem be tell me how what you think the problem actually be what we be you do what we be you try to do i mean one way to think about how a statute like this get enact be to say we be you know we be really concerned that there be low income woman do not have a lot of access to information do not

problem whether it be a problem or not it be much more targeted than the first and i guess what I be ask be be this the second kind of statute or be it the first kind of statute yeah yeah i do not i do not even remember which be the first kind of statute anymore and which be the second kind of statute but i be say a state could really be respond to a sort of generalize a feeling that in general poor woman do not have access to information or a state could be respond to a a feeling that there be a particular kind of a center that be mislead woman as to what they do and do not provide and i can see this statute arise in either of those two way and want you to tell me why you think it arise in the first way and not in the second ,372.56000000000006,Roberts Court,"Mar 20, 2018","National

2017,Hamer v. Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago,114,Elena Kagan,"Do you think a rule can ever be jurisdictional without being codified in a statute? But that's a flat rule, there are no exceptions to it? What if the rule, for example, interpreted statutory language? What -- what would those circumstances be? Mr. Stewart, do I understand you to no longer be relying on the argument that this is a jurisdictional rule? Because you've been standing up there for a while now making arguments that would be true if it weren't a jurisdictional rule. I mean, so which is it? Do you think that this is a jurisdictional -- that this is a jurisdictional rule or that it wasn't but still we should accept what the Seventh Circuit did? But I think what Justice Ginsburg said a while ago is that when we have used that term in the past, what we've meant is that it's -- it's a -- it's a mandatory claims processing rule that you have to follow unless the party, the other party forfeits the issue -- -- or unless there's a very good reason, you know, there's some kind of extra special excuse that you have. But, you know, where there is a forfeiture and where the -- that's the end of the matter, you can call it a mandatory claims processing rule or not, but you forfeited it. So suppose there is a congressional statute which does set forth a jurisdictional rule, and Congress wakes up one day and decides, you know what, we don't think that this rule should be jurisdictional anymore. How does it change that? Yes. So Congress would presumably pass a piece of legislation which no longer included the rule, right? But that's what Congress did here, I guess. I mean, what else do you expect Congress to do if it changes its mind? Like -- -- we're taking away this jurisdictional rule and we really mean it? ",do you think a rule can ever be jurisdictional without be codify in a statute but that be a flat rule there be no exception to it what if the rule for example interpret statutory language what what would those circumstance be mr stewart do i understand you to no longer be rely on the argument that this be a jurisdictional rule because you have be stand up there for a while now make argument that would be true if it be not a jurisdictional rule i mean so which be it do you think that this be a jurisdictional that this be a jurisdictional rule or that it be not but still we should accept what the seventh circuit do but i think what justice ginsburg say a while ago be that when we have use that term in the past what we have mean be that it be it be a it be a mandatory claim process rule that you have to follow unless the party the other party forfeit the issue or unless there be a very good reason you know there be some kind of extra special excuse that you have but you know where there be a forfeiture and where the that be the end of the matter you can call it a mandatory claim process rule or not but you forfeit it so suppose there be a congressional statute which do set forth a jurisdictional rule and congress wake up one day and decides you know what we do not think that this rule should be jurisdictional anymore how do it change that yes so congress would presumably pass a piece of legislation which no longer include the rule right but that be what congress do here i guess i mean what else do you expect congress to do if it change its mind like we be take away this jurisdictional rule and we really mean it ,111.07999999999998,Roberts Court,"Oct 10, 2017",Charmaine Hamer,Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago,16-658,"Feb 27, 2017","Nov 8, 2017",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2017,Wisconsin Central Ltd. v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Dupree, in the way you talked about it, it's not just that we have to give meaning to the term ""money."" I think you're quite right to say that the term we have to look at is ""money remuneration."" Is that correct? And so that's really money in a -- in a compensation scheme, right? I mean, that's what that means. Remuneration. So let's even take your own definition, which I think that there's a lot to be said for. Your definition tends -- of money tends to be the one that's first in the dictionaries. So you said a generally accepted medium of exchange. But now you put that with the word ""remuneration"", in other words, in a compensation scheme, and then the question becomes: Is stock a generally accepted medium of exchange in a compensation scheme? And I would think that the answer to that is yes. I mean, we see this all over the place, that companies give stock as well as cash in a compensation scheme, that it is a generally accepted medium of exchange for compensation. Well, I think partly it's because, you know, some companies might give free lunches and other companies might not give free lunches, and -- and you -- I mean, this is -- this is a kind -- instead of getting a check, you're getting stock. Isn't that right? Well -- right. But you can -- -- you can take it in stock. You can take it in cash. Ninety-three percent of -- of some of these companies' employees just take it in cash; forget about the stock. So why isn't it just, you know, you can get it in cash, you can get it as a stock option or in stock when that matures; it's a generally accepted medium of exchange? But that's why -- I mean, in your briefs, you keep on saying you can't take a stock option to a grocery store. But I think -- and that's obviously right. But I think what I'm saying is that would be a relevant question if all we were asking is what's the definition of money. But that's not what we're asking. We're asking what's the definition of money remuneration. So the fact that you can't take a stock option to a grocery store is irrelevant to that question. The question is that, when it comes to compensation, is a stock option used interchangeably with money? And, I think in this company and many others, it is. Isn't it? Well, let me ask another question, Mr. Dupree, just to test this a little bit. So let's say a company has two employees, and one employee makes $200,000 in cash and is granted $5 million in stock-based compensation. Two hundred thousand plus five million. And the other employee is just given $250,000 in cash. Now who makes more money? Right. So the answer to my question is, of course, the guy who gets the $5 million in stock makes more money. Mr. -- Mr. Dupree, just asking a question, not about the text but about reasons and purposes: What would be your best reason for why there should be a distinction between FICA and the railroad system with respect to stock options? Well, I understand the government to be saying that that did exclude certain kinds of things that were clearly not cash-based, but -- you know, lunches or something like that, but that's a different question from the one I'm asking. I'm just saying look at this thing, stock options, and say why -- why would Congress want it to be taxable in FICA but not taxable in the railroad system? I guess I'm still waiting for a difference that would -- would -- would match why Congress would make this different treatment of stock options. Ms. -- Ms. Kovner, in what circumstances do you think we are allowed to look at what is clearly the natural import of that exemption? In other words, that exemption came about later, so do we have to find that ""money remuneration"" is an ambiguous phrase in order to look at it, or do we take the statute as a whole just generally? I mean, I suppose your answer would -- Ms. Kovner, would your answer to the Chief Justice's question be different if a -- if a company said you can take a bushel of wheat or its equivalent in cash value? And -- -- and, Ms. Kovner -- But if I -- If you could just go back to some answers you gave to prior questions about how to work this on privately listed companies, did -- did I get it right that you're just saying that -- that the how and exactly -- the -- the method by which this is understood as taxable in this context is the same as in the income tax context? Is that right? ",mr dupree in the way you talk about it it be not just that we have to give meaning to the term money i think you be quite right to say that the term we have to look at be money remuneration be that correct and so that be really money in a in a compensation scheme right i mean that be what that mean remuneration so let us even take your own definition which i think that there be a lot to be say for your definition tends of money tends to be the one that be first in the dictionary so you say a generally accepted medium of exchange but now you put that with the word remuneration in other word in a compensation scheme and then the question become be stock a generally accepted medium of exchange in a compensation scheme and i would think that the answer to that be yes i mean we see this all over the place that company give stock as well as cash in a compensation scheme that it be a generally accepted medium of exchange for compensation well i think partly it be because you know some company might give free lunch and other company might not give free lunch and and you i mean this be this be a kind instead of get a check you be get stock be not that right well right but you can you can take it in stock you can take it in cash ninety three percent of of some of these company employee just take it in cash forget about the stock so why be not it just you know you can get it in cash you can get it as a stock option or in stock when that mature it be a generally accepted medium of exchange but that be why i mean in your brief you keep on say you can not take a stock option to a grocery store but i think and that be obviously right but i think what I be say be that would be a relevant question if all we we be ask be what be the definition of money but that be not what we be ask we be ask what be the definition of money remuneration so the fact that you can not take a stock option to a grocery store be irrelevant to that question the question be that when it come to compensation be a stock option use interchangeably with money and i think in this company and many others it be be not it well let me ask another question mr dupree just to test this a little bit so let us say a company have two employee and one employee make in cash and be grant million in stock base compensation two hundred thousand plus five million and the other employee be just give in cash now who make more money right so the answer to my question be of course the guy who get the million in stock make more money mr mr dupree just ask a question not about the text but about reason and purpose what would be your best reason for why there should be a distinction between fica and the railroad system with respect to stock option well i understand the government to be say that that do exclude certain kind of thing that we be clearly not cash base but you know lunch or something like that but that be a different question from the one I be ask I be just say look at this thing stock option and say why why would congress want it to be taxable in fica but not taxable in the railroad system i guess I be still wait for a difference that would would would match why congress would make this different treatment of stock option ms ms kovner in what circumstance do you think we be allow to look at what be clearly the natural import of that exemption in other word that exemption come about later so do we have to find that money remuneration be an ambiguous phrase in order to look at it or do we take the statute as a whole just generally i mean i suppose your answer would ms kovner would your answer to the chief justice s question be different if a if a company say you can take a bushel of wheat or its equivalent in cash value and and ms kovner but if i if you could just go back to some answer you give to prior question about how to work this on privately list company do do i get it right that you be just say that that the how and exactly the the method by which this be understood as taxable in this context be the same as in the income tax context be that right ,285.12999999999994,Roberts Court,"Apr 16, 2018","Wisconsin Central Ltd., et al.",United States of America,17-530,"Jan 12, 2018","Jun 21, 2018",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2017,Pereira v. Sessions,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Zimmer, you just said defines the notice of appear. Why do you think that those 10 requirements of what have to be in a notice to appear define a notice to appear? You could imagine a case where somebody says, well, look, Requirement 7 isn't in the notice. That was a mistake. So it's a flawed notice to appear, but it's still a notice to appear. It doesn't become not a notice to appear because there's a flaw in it. Mr. Zimmer, can I take you back to the language of the statute and just ask about your assertion that this is clearly definitional in nature? I mean, one question is, is that necessary to your argument? And then the other question is, you know, here's an alternative view of this language, which is this language is a -- it's -- it's -- it's a notice of shorthand, it's -- you know, we need to call this thing something, this -- this thing which tells you to appear in -- at removal proceedings, and this is what we're going to call it. But it doesn't suggest that everything that we say about this document is -- defines what a notice to appeal is. So, you know, respond to that, and then tell me whether it's crucial that I agree with your response to that. Yes. I mean, it's obvious that the document is called a notice to appear. But the question is whether, if the document is flawed in some way, that it becomes not a notice to appear, as opposed to just a notice to appear which is flawed in some way. I mean, nobody had any doubt that what was filed here or what was sent here was a notice to appear, isn't that right? But, Mr. Liu, this might be the same question and, if so, I -- I apologize for beating you over the head with it, but a -- a notice to appear, it's a special kind of charging document. It's telling you that the government wants you to appear. And then, if the government wants you to appear, the first thing you need to know is, where am I supposed to appear? When am I supposed to appear? So that there will be somebody who will do what they want to do with me when I appear. So it's -- I mean, it would -- it would seem actually even more than the charges itself that a notice to appear, you know, the sine qua non is telling you where you should appear. Well, you talk about it as a charging document. And I hate to interrupt you, but I'll just -- it's not any old charging document. It's a notice to appear, which means somebody has to know where they're supposed to appear and when. Mr. Liu -- Could we go back, Mr. Liu, to the text of the statute, and could you tell me what your best response is to Mr. Zimmer's argument about this parenthetical ""(in this section -- -- referred to as a ""notice to appear"")"", which he says makes it clear that everything that follows is part of the definition of a notice to appear. So then what do we look to? When you were giving your sense of it has to include this, but it doesn't have to include that -- -- if -- if -- if we don't look to that parenthetical for the reason that you said, what do we look to to decide what is definitionally part of a notice to appear? ",mr zimmer you just say defines the notice of appear why do you think that those requirement of what have to be in a notice to appear define a notice to appear you could imagine a case where somebody say well look requirement be not in the notice that be a mistake so it be a flawed notice to appear but it be still a notice to appear it do not become not a notice to appear because there be a flaw in it mr zimmer can i take you back to the language of the statute and just ask about your assertion that this be clearly definitional in nature i mean one question be be that necessary to your argument and then the other question be you know here s an alternative view of this language which be this language be a it be it be it be a notice of shorthand it be you know we need to call this thing something this this thing which tell you to appear in at removal proceeding and this be what we be go to call it but it do not suggest that everything that we say about this document be define what a notice to appeal be so you know respond to that and then tell me whether it be crucial that i agree with your response to that yes i mean it be obvious that the document be call a notice to appear but the question be whether if the document be flaw in some way that it become not a notice to appear as oppose to just a notice to appear which be flaw in some way i mean nobody have any doubt that what be file here or what be send here be a notice to appear be not that right but mr liu this might be the same question and if so i i apologize for beat you over the head with it but a a notice to appear it be a special kind of charge document it be tell you that the government want you to appear and then if the government want you to appear the first thing you need to know be where be i suppose to appear when be i suppose to appear so that there will be somebody who will do what they want to do with me when i appear so it be i mean it would it would seem actually even more than the charge itself that a notice to appear you know the sine qua non be tell you where you should appear well you talk about it as a charge document and i hate to interrupt you but I will just it be not any old charging document it be a notice to appear which mean somebody have to know where they be suppose to appear and when mr liu could we go back mr liu to the text of the statute and could you tell me what your best response be to mr zimmer s argument about this parenthetical in this section refer to as a notice to appear which he say make it clear that everything that follow be part of the definition of a notice to appear so then what do we look to when you we be give your sense of it have to include this but it do not have to include that if if if we do not look to that parenthetical for the reason that you say what do we look to to decide what be definitionally part of a notice to appear ,178.84000000000003,Roberts Court,"Apr 23, 2018",Wescley Fonseca Pereira,"Jefferson B.

2017,Gill v. Whitford,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, if I could just stop you there for a second, because I was under the impression that legislators are capable of doing this actually pretty easily now. You know, the world of voting technology has changed a great deal, and when legislatures think about drawing these maps, they're not only thinking about the next election, they're thinking often -- not always -- but often about the election after that and the election after that and the election after that, and they do sensitivity testing, and they use other methods in order to ensure that certain results will obtain not only in the next one but eight years down the road. And it seems to me that, just as legislatures do that, in order to entrench majorities -- or minorities, as the case may be -- in order to entrench a party in power, so, too, those same techniques, which have become extremely sophisticated, can be used to evaluate what they're doing. What -- what I'm suggesting is that this is not kind of hypothetical, airy-fairy, we guess, and then we guess again. I mean, this is pretty scientific by this point. Well, there are plenty areas of law, Ms. Murphy, where we look at intent beyond the face of a statute. And, you know, sometimes that's harder than other times. We understand it can be difficult. We understand in other cases it can be easy. But we do it all over the place in our law. We don't -- we don't say, oh, if it's not on the face of the statute, we're never going to look at it. So, if your answer to Justice Alito is, well, on the face of the statute, that's certainly a manageable standard, I guess I would ask why not if it's not on the face of the statute? But you absolutely -- you know, but you have good evidence that there was the intent here, and you have good evidence that the intent led to a certain kind of effect, which was to entrench a party in power. But there is a difference -- Mr. Smith. In a one-person one-vote case, does one person in an overpopulated district have standing to challenge not only that district, those district lines, but the entire state map? And why is that, and does it -- is it an analogy to this case? Mr. Smith, may I -- I'm sorry. Please. I -- I think that this symmetry idea is both an intuitive and an attractive principle. So, if the first question was do you have a substantive principle, I actually think you do. The second question is, is there ways -- are there ways to make sure that not every district is subject to challenge as violating that principle? And so I'd like to hear you talk about that. How is it that we are not going to create a world in which in every district somebody can come in and say: A-ha, there's been a violation of partisan symmetry; we're entitled to a redrawn map? What's the threshold? Where do you draw the line? Because this -- this -- it seems to me that this map goes over pretty much every line you can name. But where do you draw the line in another case and another case? So are you suggesting that we should be looking for outliers or are you suggesting that we should be trying to filter out all manner of partisan consideration, or is it someplace in between? Would it be fair to require plaintiffs to provide those maps, many, many of them, so that one can tell whether the actual map is an outlier? So, for an example, that becomes a way to filter out the effects of geography from the effects of partisan advantage? ",well if i could just stop you there for a second because i be under the impression that legislator be capable of do this actually pretty easily now you know the world of vote technology have change a great deal and when legislature think about draw these map they be not only think about the next election they be think often not always but often about the election after that and the election after that and the election after that and they do sensitivity testing and they use other method in order to ensure that certain result will obtain not only in the next one but eight year down the road and it seem to me that just as legislature do that in order to entrench majority or minority as the case may be in order to entrench a party in power so too those same technique which have become extremely sophisticated can be use to evaluate what they be do what what I be suggest be that this be not kind of hypothetical airy fairy we guess and then we guess again i mean this be pretty scientific by this point well there be plenty area of law ms murphy where we look at intent beyond the face of a statute and you know sometimes that be hard than other time we understand it can be difficult we understand in other case it can be easy but we do it all over the place in our law we do not we do not say oh if it be not on the face of the statute we be never go to look at it so if your answer to justice alito be well on the face of the statute that be certainly a manageable standard i guess i would ask why not if it be not on the face of the statute but you absolutely you know but you have good evidence that there be the intent here and you have good evidence that the intent lead to a certain kind of effect which be to entrench a party in power but there be a difference mr smith in a one person one vote case do one person in an overpopulated district have stand to challenge not only that district those district line but the entire state map and why be that and do it be it an analogy to this case mr smith may i I be sorry please i i think that this symmetry idea be both an intuitive and an attractive principle so if the first question be do you have a substantive principle i actually think you do the second question be be there way be there way to make sure that not every district be subject to challenge as violate that principle and so I would like to hear you talk about that how be it that we be not go to create a world in which in every district somebody can come in and say a ha there be be a violation of partisan symmetry we be entitle to a redrawn map what be the threshold where do you draw the line because this this it seem to me that this map go over pretty much every line you can name but where do you draw the line in another case and another case so be you suggest that we should be look for outlier or be you suggest that we should be try to filter out all manner of partisan consideration or be it someplace in between would it be fair to require plaintiff to provide those map many many of them so that one can tell whether the actual map be an outlier so for an example that become a way to filter out the effect of geography from the effect of partisan advantage ,221.48,Roberts Court,"Oct 3, 2017",,,16-1161,,"Jun 18, 2018",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2017,Hughes v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Shumsky? I'm sorry. Please continue -- I mean, the question is, what is the second best? We're in a world in which the first-best option, which is five people agreeing on the reasoning, that doesn't exist. And so everything else is going to be -- is going to have some kind of problem attached to it, and we're really picking among problems. I guess what I wonder is why you say the -- the solution that we should pick is just a solution in which this Court is giving no guidance and courts are out there on their own and doing their own thing and splitting with each other, dividing with each other, not having any way to resolve these cases, which sounds like chaos to me. And the government -- what the government says is: Look, this isn't the best approach, but it's the second-best approach, is if you don't have common reasoning, just ask about results. And if you can look at a case and know that there are five justices on the Supreme Court who think X rather than Y, then you should go with X. And we can talk about how that counts dissenting votes or, you know, give various theoretical objections to that, but, in the end, we do try to get to five here. We know how to get to five in some of these cases, even if the five depend on different reasoning. Why isn't that just the second-best approach? Well, you carve out a set of cases, and then, when it's not completely nested in the way that you want it to be, you vote for chaos. And I guess I'm asking, why vote for chaos in all of these cases or even in some of these cases? Well, Mr. Shumsky, I think -- I think your approach relies on dissents sometimes too, because take one of these logical subset cases. You have a concurrence that is a logical subset of the plurality. And you say, well, the concurrence controls. And that's true even as to times where the concurrence splits off with the plurality and joins with the dissent. So you're counting dissents too, I think. It's necessary to the judgment, but the result of applying -- but, you know, the plurality would grant relief in this much -- this many cases. The concurrence would grant relief in many fewer cases and deny relief in lots of cases where the dissent would also deny relief. So, by privileging the concurrence, you're essentially saying that when the concurrence agrees with the dissent, the concurrence wins, which I take it is a way -- is -- is -- is because the concurrence plus the dissent equals five. I'm talking about a case in which it is completely nested, but the -- but -- it is completely nested, but the concurrence is sometimes granting the relief that the plurality would but sometimes, instead, reaching the result the dissent would. And by saying the concurrence controls in those cases, you're giving effect to the times when the concurrence plus the dissent equals five. So, in those circumstances, there is no result? That might be true, but it might not be. I mean, there are middle ground positions that, if --in a 4-1-4 case, where the four would say, well, if we can't get what we want, we'd rather have the middle ground position. But there are some cases where there are middle ground positions which seem utterly incoherent to anybody else, incoherent or maybe it's based on what you think is an impermissible criterion, or for some reason the middle ground is the worst of all possible worlds. So how do you deal with those sorts of cases? ",mr shumsky I be sorry please continue i mean the question be what be the second best we be in a world in which the first best option which be five people agree on the reasoning that do not exist and so everything else be go to be be go to have some kind of problem attach to it and we be really pick among problem i guess what i wonder be why you say the the solution that we should pick be just a solution in which this court be give no guidance and court be out there on their own and do their own thing and splitting with each other divide with each other not have any way to resolve these case which sound like chaos to me and the government what the government say be look this be not the best approach but it be the second best approach be if you do not have common reasoning just ask about result and if you can look at a case and know that there be five justice on the supreme court who think x rather than y then you should go with x and we can talk about how that count dissent vote or you know give various theoretical objection to that but in the end we do try to get to five here we know how to get to five in some of these case even if the five depend on different reasoning why be not that just the second best approach well you carve out a set of case and then when it be not completely nest in the way that you want it to be you vote for chaos and i guess I be ask why vote for chaos in all of these case or even in some of these case well mr shumsky i think i think your approach relies on dissent sometimes too because take one of these logical subset case you have a concurrence that be a logical subset of the plurality and you say well the concurrence control and that be true even as to time where the concurrence split off with the plurality and join with the dissent so you be count dissent too i think it be necessary to the judgment but the result of apply but you know the plurality would grant relief in this much this many case the concurrence would grant relief in many few case and deny relief in lot of case where the dissent would also deny relief so by privilege the concurrence you be essentially say that when the concurrence agree with the dissent the concurrence win which i take it be a way be be be because the concurrence plus the dissent equal five I be talk about a case in which it be completely nested but the but it be completely nested but the concurrence be sometimes grant the relief that the plurality would but sometimes instead reach the result the dissent would and by say the concurrence control in those case you be give effect to the time when the concurrence plus the dissent equal five so in those circumstance there be no result that might be true but it might not be i mean there be middle ground position that if in a case where the four would say well if we can not get what we want we would rather have the middle ground position but there be some case where there be middle ground position which seem utterly incoherent to anybody else incoherent or maybe it be base on what you think be an impermissible criterion or for some reason the middle ground be the bad of all possible world so how do you deal with those sort of case ,221.54,Roberts Court,"Mar 27, 2018",Erik Lindsey Hughes,United States of America,17-155,"Dec 8, 2017","Jun 4, 2018",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

2017,Ohio v. American Express Co.,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Stewart, you admit, as does General Murphy, that at the second stage it's appropriate for the courts to take into account how this all plays out on the cardholder side of the market. If that's the case, why doesn't that enter into the question of how you define the market in the first instance? Mr. Chesler -- Mr. Chelser -- I don't think that that's right, Mr. Chesler. I mean, I think that the Discover issue is about protecting low-cost products because the reason that we've -- that we've said vertical restraints are often perfectly fine -- indeed, better for competition -- is because it allows us to have some high-cost products and some low-cost products. High cost/high service, low cost/low service. The problem here is that the effect of these anti-steering provisions means a market where we will only have high cost/high service products. And any competitor that wants to come in and says, you know what, we want to compete in a different way, we want to compete in terms of cost, is going to find itself unable to do so. And that's the thing that makes this vertical restraint, it seems to me, different -- different from others. Mr. Chesler, if I'm a consumer -- I mean, it might be that I'm very altruistic and I just care about my local coffee shop and the kind of deal that the proprietors are getting, but more to the point, what I really care about is if that local coffee shop can past on -- pass on its decrease in price to me. And that's exactly what the anti-steering provisions prevent. It prevents the vendor from passing on the lower merchant fees to the consumer. And as long as that's the case, you're just not going to be able to construct a business strategy based on a low-cost card. And this is exactly -- I mean, this is not me making this up. I mean, there was a seven-week trial. And that's exactly what the district court found. And these are findings of fact about Discover, about the effect of -- of -- of -- of this anti-steering provision on the actual state of competition in the market, meaning on the ability of low-cost cards to compete. Well, Mr. Chesler, what the -- Mr. Chesler, I don't -- I don't have 42 years of antitrust experience, teaching or practicing, but -- So I just think of this in sort of simple-minded ways. Here's what the district court found. The district court found that merchants cannot steer customers to cheaper forms of payment. The district court found that all of the credit card firms have consistently raised their prices. Even when you look at these two-sided prices, the district court found that these price increases were not being passed on to consumers. And the district court found that it was impossible for a credit card company that wanted to offer a low cost/low price product to enter the market. So you put all of those things together, that sounds like a market that is not working in the way it's supposed to, at least sufficiently to get on to the second step where you can make all your arguments about why it is that a market where the prices only go up and where no low-price competition can emerge is, nonetheless, a good market. Well, it's the one hand where the government has the burden. And now, if you want to come in and you can say, look, there are all these great benefits that go beyond -- I mean, some of your benefits sort of seem to me to be benefits for American Express only. But if you want to say, no, that there are great benefits for the market generally, that's what step 2 is about. ",mr stewart you admit as do general murphy that at the second stage it be appropriate for the court to take into account how this all play out on the cardholder side of the market if that be the case why do not that enter into the question of how you define the market in the first instance mr chesler mr chelser i do not think that that be right mr chesler i mean i think that the discover issue be about protect low cost product because the reason that we have that we have say vertical restraint be often perfectly fine indeed good for competition be because it allow us to have some high cost product and some low cost product high costhigh service low costlow service the problem here be that the effect of these anti steer provision mean a market where we will only have high costhigh service product and any competitor that want to come in and say you know what we want to compete in a different way we want to compete in term of cost be go to find itself unable to do so and that be the thing that make this vertical restraint it seem to me different different from others mr chesler if I be a consumer i mean it might be that I be very altruistic and i just care about my local coffee shop and the kind of deal that the proprietor be get but more to the point what i really care about be if that local coffee shop can past on pas on its decrease in price to me and that be exactly what the anti steer provision prevent it prevent the vendor from pass on the low merchant fee to the consumer and as long as that be the case you be just not go to be able to construct a business strategy base on a low cost card and this be exactly i mean this be not me make this up i mean there be a seven week trial and that be exactly what the district court find and these be finding of fact about discover about the effect of of of of this anti steer provision on the actual state of competition in the market mean on the ability of low cost card to compete well mr chesler what the mr chesler i do not i do not have year of antitrust experience teaching or practicing but so i just think of this in sort of simple mind way here s what the district court find the district court find that merchant can not steer customer to cheap form of payment the district court find that all of the credit card firm have consistently raise their price even when you look at these two side price the district court find that these price increase we be not be pass on to consumer and the district court find that it be impossible for a credit card company that want to offer a low costlow price product to enter the market so you put all of those thing together that sound like a market that be not work in the way it be suppose to at least sufficiently to get on to the second step where you can make all your argument about why it be that a market where the price only go up and where no low price competition can emerge be nonetheless a good market well it be the one hand where the government have the burden and now if you want to come in and you can say look there be all these great benefit that go beyond i mean some of your benefit sort of seem to me to be benefit for american express only but if you want to say no that there be great benefit for the market generally that be what step be about ,233.64,Roberts Court,"Feb 26, 2018","State of Ohio, et al.","American Express Company, et al.",16-1454,"Oct 16, 2017","Jun 25, 2018",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2017,Collins v. Virginia,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Fitzgerald -- I'm sorry, did you -- Can I go back to the exchange that you had with Justice Alito? When you gave your hypothetical about the drugs and he said, well, that would be different, it would be -- it's very different in a home, but here you have the motorcycle parked out in the open, on the driveway in this enclosure, where you can see it from the street. And I guess this is the question I want to ask you. If -- if there is that difference, like in a home you better have a warrant. But here it's out on the street but in the curtilage, in the curtilage, and that's established. You know, it's not -- it's not disputed here. How far are we committed by Jardines to treat the curtilage exactly as we would the home? That seems to me to be important given the, I think, the -- the things that you and Justice Alito agreed on. So how far do we say: Look, what Jardines said or what we've said in other cases is we have to treat the curtilage exactly as we would the home, even though you can actually see the motorcycle on the curtilage. Mr. Cox, can -- Mr. Cox. I mean, one of the things you're saying is that we basically should give -- we shouldn't pay attention to the fact that this was on the curtilage, and you said earlier -- to a different question, you said, well, you're committed by Jardines to treat the curtilage as the home for purposes of expectation of privacy, but for other purposes, you can make a distinction between the two. And I'd like to know more about that. For what other purposes can you make a distinction between the two? And why can you make a distinction between the two for those purposes when you can't make a distinction between the two for this fundamental question of where you have an expectation of privacy? I'm sorry. You're -- I just want to get the answer to my question, which is: For what purposes would you treat the curtilage differently from the home and why there but not for the -- for the reasonable expectation of privacy question? So, for what purposes first, and then why? It -- it's just -- Mr. Cox, it's really a simple question. For what purposes would you say that the curtilage is not the house? And -- and why is that -- why would you treat -- why would you not treat them the same for purposes of when you need a warrant if you do treat them the same for deciding whether there's a reasonable expectation of privacy in them? You see, I don't know. Just -- when I read Jardines, here's what I take it to say: I take it to say the home is the most sacrosanct of places. And, actually, we don't think that the home stops at the door; we think that there are some areas like the porch and like the driveway or whatever, and we can argue about exactly what those areas are, but there are some areas which are just as sacrosanct as your living room. That's what I take Jardines to say. And in that case, I think you lose here. Mr. Cox, was there one search here or were there two searches here? The search of the motorcycle? But why is that? Why isn't there the search of the motorcycle -- but there's really the search of the curtilage; it happened to be for the motorcycle, but it's the search of the curtilage, it's a different search entirely. Well, does -- does that mean you, without a warrant, that you always have access to a place if there's a reason that you can seize something that you might find within the place?

2017,"Oil States Energy Services LLC v. Greene’s Energy Group, LLC",114,Elena Kagan,"What about inter partes reexamination? But I thought -- So -- I'm sorry. Ms. Ho -- -- can I -- can I take you back to this question of where you would draw the line -- -- between ex parte and inter partes reexamination on the one hand and this? Because, as I understand what you would permit, those proceedings too can be initiated by a third party -- you know, can be at the request of a third party, and -- and those -- in those proceedings too, the third party can participate in some way, can file a reply to the patentee's statement, can make known its views. So what's the line? Where would you -- what are the procedures that are here that you think make this essentially adjudicatory that are not in those other proceedings? Well, I didn't say they fall out. There are opportunities for it to make known its views as to what -- So what is it? Is it discovery? Is it -- is it participation in the hearing? I mean, I just want to ground this in something. But what -- what's the most that the government could do, do you think? You know, what's the -- what are the -- how many of these things do you have to take away before you have a constitutional system? Well, one understanding of this, Ms. Ho, is that this is the government in a real sense. It's the government trying to figure out whether it made a mistake by granting the patent, which the government sometimes does and knows it sometimes does, but the government wants to put in place a set of procedures that will actually increase the government's accuracy in figuring out whether it made a mistake. And that involves listening to a third party that has some interest in the proceeding. So it seems a little bit odd to say, sure, the government can reexamine this, the government can allow a third party to request it, can allow the third party to do some things, but there's some line that falls short of what the government thinks are the procedures that enable the greatest accuracy. So why -- why would we do that? Well, here is -- -- how about -- how about if there were no judicial review at all? Yes. Then you would have to say yes, right? No, no, no. There are administrative law judges all over this country, aren't there? Well, Mr. Stewart -- How important, Mr. Stewart, is judicial review here? I mean, would you concede that there's a constitutional problem, either if there's no judicial review at all or if the judicial review were deferential as to matters of law? Well, if I could just -- -- I mean, because there are formal adjudications all over the place in agencies. I mean, for example, the NLRB runs by formal adjudications and, indeed, when they try to make rules, Congress slaps them down and says we want adjudications. So how is that different?

2017,China Agritech v. Resh,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Aronson -- I guess I don't understand, Mr. Aronson, why the diligence argument doesn't work the same way in the second stage, after the denial, as it does in the first. In other words, in American Pipe, what we said was, if you're relying on a class action, that's diligence enough. Now, you know, that might itself be controversial, contestable, but that's what we said in American Pipe. And I guess, having said that, I don't see why it's also not diligence enough to rely on a new class action. No, I don't -- I mean, it obviously didn't deal with this case, but the whole theory of American Pipe was that for any given individual, we weren't going to make them come forward; we were going to say reliance on a class action is sufficient to show diligence. So, here, these people were doing just that. They're relying on a class action. It happens to be a second class action, but under the same theory, they should be able to rely in order to show diligence, that that's what we said counted as diligence. Well -- Let's suppose you're right about that, Mr. Aronson, that what Rule 23 is primarily about, it's a comparison of class actions to individual actions and saying there are times in which we think class actions is the more efficient way to do things than a million individual actions. But, again, that interest seems to be the same here because, once the class certification is denied, you're saying, well, now everybody has to come bring their individual actions. And I think what somebody who was looking at the American Pipe reasoning might say is something to the effect of: No, just as, at time one, it made more sense to have a class action than a thousand individual actions, so too, at time two, it makes more sense to have a class action than a thousand individual actions. Nothing has changed. Well, here, again, of course, they didn't deal with this case. All I'm suggesting is that both interests that they mention are served in the identical way with respect to what should happen after denial of a class certification motion as before. Well, there was always a question in American Pipe that we were doing something extraordinary, that we were saying it doesn't matter that the statute of limitations has run on you. And we did it for two reasons: Because we think -- thought that there was enough diligence and because we thought that Rule 23 policies indicated that we should encourage the class action device rather than the individual action device. And here, again, the exact same thing is true. Diligence is shown in the same way by reliance on the class, and, once again, even after the denial of a single motion for class certification, Rule 23 would indicate that we don't want to have a million individual suits but instead want to encourage a class. But that -- Well, Mr. Aronson, let me give you a hypothetical. I mean, suppose it's one of these class actions where there's actually a very serious wrong and aggregate damages are very high, but each individual person's damages are very low, $32. And there's a class certification motion, and let's say in this there is -- that motion is denied for a reason that really has nothing to do with whether this is something that's properly treated by a class action. Let's suppose that, just on the individual facts of the case, this was a bad named plaintiff, not adequate -- not an adequate representative. Your theory would then say: Okay, so he's dismissed, the statute of limitations has run because these things take a long time, and then all these people with extremely valid claims, claims that we would want to be brought in order to force defendants to internalize the costs of their illegal behavior, well, too bad, that just can't go forward. They all have claims that are $32 claims. But that is the entire purpose of our -- of -- of Rule 23, is that we understand that with respect to some category of claims, we're not going to have them individually or it will be so ridiculous if we have them individually that we would prefer the class action device. Well, but, again, here, it's not working just for some reason that has nothing to do with the appropriateness of class treatment; it just has to do with the fact that one named plaintiff is not a good named plaintiff. Well -- well, that's true, Mr. Frederick, but I had the same question that Justice Alito had because let's assume, just for the sake of argument, and you can tell by my questions I'm a little bit skeptical of this, but let's assume that the interests were different. Is your argument about Rule 23, about the Rules Enabling Act, about Shady Grove, about Tyson, do -- is that an argument that applies even if you think that we're in a different world with respect to diligence and exceptional circumstances? Well, I thought that that was because the problem that he identified had been cured. ",mr aronson i guess i do not understand mr aronson why the diligence argument do not work the same way in the second stage after the denial as it do in the first in other word in american pipe what we say be if you be rely on a class action that be diligence enough now you know that might itself be controversial contestable but that be what we say in american pipe and i guess have say that i do not see why it be also not diligence enough to rely on a new class action no i do not i mean it obviously do not deal with this case but the whole theory of american pipe be that for any give individual we be not go to make them come forward we we be go to say reliance on a class action be sufficient to show diligence so here these people we be do just that they be rely on a class action it happen to be a second class action but under the same theory they should be able to rely in order to show diligence that that be what we say count as diligence well let us suppose you be right about that mr aronson that what rule be primarily about it be a comparison of class action to individual action and say there be time in which we think class action be the more efficient way to do thing than a million individual action but again that interest seem to be the same here because once the class certification be deny you be say well now everybody have to come bring their individual action and i think what somebody who be look at the american pipe reason might say be something to the effect of no just as at time one it make more sense to have a class action than a thousand individual action so too at time two it make more sense to have a class action than a thousand individual action nothing have change well here again of course they do not deal with this case all I be suggest be that both interest that they mention be serve in the identical way with respect to what should happen after denial of a class certification motion as before well there be always a question in american pipe that we we be do something extraordinary that we we be say it do not matter that the statute of limitation have run on you and we do it for two reason because we think think that there be enough diligence and because we think that rule policy indicate that we should encourage the class action device rather than the individual action device and here again the exact same thing be true diligence be show in the same way by reliance on the class and once again even after the denial of a single motion for class certification rule would indicate that we do not want to have a million individual suit but instead want to encourage a class but that well mr aronson let me give you a hypothetical i mean suppose it be one of these class action where there be actually a very serious wrong and aggregate damage be very high but each individual person s damage be very low and there be a class certification motion and let us say in this there be that motion be deny for a reason that really have nothing to do with whether this be something that be properly treat by a class action let us suppose that just on the individual fact of the case this be a bad name plaintiff not adequate not an adequate representative your theory would then say okay so he be dismiss the statute of limitation have run because these thing take a long time and then all these people with extremely valid claim claim that we would want to be bring in order to force defendant to internalize the cost of their illegal behavior well too bad that just can not go forward they all have claim that be claim but that be the entire purpose of our of of rule be that we understand that with respect to some category of claim we be not go to have them individually or it will be so ridiculous if we have them individually that we would prefer the class action device well but again here it be not work just for some reason that have nothing to do with the appropriateness of class treatment it just have to do with the fact that one name plaintiff be not a good name plaintiff well well that be true mr frederick but i have the same question that justice alito have because let us assume just for the sake of argument and you can tell by my question I be a little bit skeptical of this but let us assume that the interest we be different be your argument about rule about the rule enable act about shady grove about tyson do be that an argument that apply even if you think that we be in a different world with respect to diligence and exceptional circumstance well i think that that be because the problem that he identify have be cure ,304.6500000000001,Roberts Court,"Mar 26, 2018","China Agritech, Inc.","Michael H.

And obviously you talked about this in your brief. But I just want to give you an opportunity now to try to convince me, because right now I feel as though it comes out of thin air. It doesn't have any grounding in the text of the statute. And I guess I'm not seeing quite how the precedent gets you there. So -- Well, is that what lenity means? This -- for sure this is a broad statute. It doesn't seem very ambiguous. You know, lenity, usually we're looking for a grievous ambiguity, sort of like the last case where it's like, I don't know, you could read it this way, you could read it that way. What do we do? But that's not this statute. This statute, taken on its face, is just ungodly broad. But doesn't everybody know -- doesn't everybody know when they're given an offer like this, you know, I'd rather have cash than a check, doesn't everybody know why people would rather have cash than a check? Is that the only difference; it's just the mens rea difference? Like what? Like what? I thought that there was new guidance saying exactly that in the last year. Mr. -- Mr. Parker -- Can -- can I go back to the question of -- of -- of the Department's prosecution policy? And, you know I -- could you tell me, number 1, what the current state of the Department's guidance is as to whether prosecutors are -- are told to prosecute to the maximum extent allowed by law; and, number 2, whether that would mean in this case that here I am a prosecutor and I think that some action falls within 7212, that I would be precluded from proceeding instead under 7203 or 7205 or 7207.

In other words, in all of these districting cases, once there's a liability finding, there's a finding that a particular district is -- is drawn or more than one district is drawn in a way that violates the Constitution, the upshot of that is that you're not going to be allowed to use those district lines. But still there's a remedial process that takes place, where people argue about what the proper remedy is, and only at the end of that process, customarily, or at least it happened this way here, is there an injunction put in place saying don't use this map, instead use that map. And what I'm concerned about is that if you're right, we're going to be hearing all of these districting cases not after the remedial stage but, instead, straight away after the liability stage. General, if -- if I could -- General, if I could -- I'm sorry. But I guess I -- you -- you were saying before you were interrupted, you said what distinguishes this case, and I guess I do want to know what does distinguish this case, or is -- if in finding that there's jurisdiction here, are we going to be finding that there's jurisdiction after the liability stage at all redistricting cases? Well -- -- but it -- It seems as though that that's a -- you're essentially saying that this PI opinion was a safe harbor for the state. And that seems an odd thing to say. I mean, a PI opinion is just a PI opinion. It's preliminary. And this Court said multiple times that they're -- that it had not got -- gone through all the evidence, that it had not gone through all the facts, that this was just the best it could do at the stage it was at now. And so, to turn that around and to say this is a safe harbor for the state, isn't it essentially to stop every case at the preliminary injunction stage? General, what -- what would you think -- let's put aside the court order for a second. Just pretend it doesn't exist, which I realize is -- you know, that's an important feature of the case for you, but let's just pretend. Suppose there's one map and -- and -- and then there's a second map, and the one map is later found to have all kinds of evidence of discriminatory intent surrounding it. There are e-mails. There's everything. The second map, nothing. But the second map is exactly the same. What should a court do with respect to the second map? Should it just say there's no e-mails? I know it is. Mr. -- Mr. Kneedler, that might be true. It might have been a terrible decision to give only three days, but suppose that the court had given three weeks. Why would that have made a difference for this question of whether something is an injunction or has the practical effect of an injunction? But, Mr. Kneedler, in -- in your briefs, you acknowledge two things. You acknowledge, first, that when there are two maps and they're exactly the same, that evidence of intent as to the first map is probative of -- of -- of intent as to the second map. The question is always intent as to the second map, but if two maps are exactly the same, there's all kinds of evidence of bad intent as to the first map, surely that's probative. And I think you acknowledge that. Don't you think? Of course. Everything depends on the circumstances. The -- the -- the facts, which, you know, this Court is the -- has principal authority over. The second thing that you acknowledge in your brief is that these court orders, especially at this preliminary stage, are not safe harbors. Don't you think? So, given that the district court has so much better understanding of the facts than we do, what do you think went wrong here? I'm trying to find the legal principle that went wrong. But I don't think that it did that. And I -- I recognize that there are some sentences which can be read either way. But if I understand you correctly, you're suggesting that there was a shift in the burden of proof. And that would be a legal error. But -- but -- but here's what they said. The district court said: ""The plaintiffs can establish their claim by showing that the legislature adopted the 2013 plans with a discriminatory purpose, maintained the district lines with a discriminatory purpose, or intentionally furthered preexisting intentional discrimination."" So it's talking about here is the way the plaintiffs can establish their claim. What happened in 2013? Well, that might be right, Mr. Kneedler, that there's no presumption that comes from, but -- but it's -- it's surely evidence that one can take into account that the legislature didn't engage in any kind of deliberative process -- -- after having done a map that's tainted with all kinds of discriminatory intent. ",well general i think that that might well be true but i think it be it be also true in pretty much all of these district case in other word in all of these district case once there be a liability finding there be a finding that a particular district be be draw or more than one district be draw in a way that violate the constitution the upshot of that be that you be not go to be allow to use those district line but still there be a remedial process that take place where people argue about what the proper remedy be and only at the end of that process customarily or at least it happen this way here be there an injunction put in place say do not use this map instead use that map and what I be concerned about be that if you be right we be go to be hear all of these district case not after the remedial stage but instead straight away after the liability stage general if if i could general if i could I be sorry but i guess i you you we be say before you we be interrupt you say what distinguish this case and i guess i do want to know what do distinguish this case or be if in find that there be jurisdiction here be we go to be find that there be jurisdiction after the liability stage at all redistricting case well but it it seem as though that that be a you be essentially say that this pi opinion be a safe harbor for the state and that seem an odd thing to say i mean a pi opinion be just a pi opinion it be preliminary and this court say multiple time that they be that it have not get go through all the evidence that it have not go through all the fact that this be just the best it could do at the stage it be at now and so to turn that around and to say this be a safe harbor for the state be not it essentially to stop every case at the preliminary injunction stage general what what would you think let us put aside the court order for a second just pretend it do not exist which i realize be you know that be an important feature of the case for you but let us just pretend suppose there be one map and and and then there be a second map and the one map be later find to have all kind of evidence of discriminatory intent surround it there be e mail there be everything the second map nothing but the second map be exactly the same what should a court do with respect to the second map should it just say there be no e mail i know it be mr mr kneedler that might be true it might have be a terrible decision to give only three day but suppose that the court have give three week why would that have make a difference for this question of whether something be an injunction or have the practical effect of an injunction but mr kneedler in in your brief you acknowledge two thing you acknowledge first that when there be two map and they be exactly the same that evidence of intent as to the first map be probative of of of intent as to the second map the question be always intent as to the second map but if two map be exactly the same there have all kind of evidence of bad intent as to the first map surely that be probative and i think you acknowledge that do not you think of course everything depend on the circumstance the the the fact which you know this court be the have principal authority over the second thing that you acknowledge in your brief be that these court order especially at this preliminary stage be not safe harbor do not you think so give that the district court have so much good understanding of the fact than we do what do you think go wrong here I be try to find the legal principle that go wrong but i do not think that it do that and i i recognize that there be some sentence which can be read either way but if i understand you correctly you be suggest that there be a shift in the burden of proof and that would be a legal error but but but here s what they say the district court say the plaintiff can establish their claim by show that the legislature adopt the plan with a discriminatory purpose maintain the district line with a discriminatory purpose or intentionally furthered preexist intentional discrimination so it be talk about here be the way the plaintiff can establish their claim what happen in well that might be right mr kneedler that there be no presumption that come from but but it be it be surely evidence that one can take into account that the legislature do not engage in any kind of deliberative process after have do a map that be taint with all kind of discriminatory intent ,284.04,Roberts Court,"Apr 24, 2018",,,17-586,"Jan 12, 2018","Jun 25, 2018",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2017,Dahda v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"Where do you see it in the statute as requiring that? Is your -- is your view dependent on our accepting that, that it's not only a foundational requirement but that it's a foundational requirement that has to be on the face of the order? Well, irrespective of whether the jurisdiction has to be stated on the face of the order? Well, Mr. Shan -- But, Mr. Tripp, if -- if -- if you -- if the order doesn't have to include anything about territorial jurisdiction, how is anybody to know whether it approves interception only within the territorial jurisdiction or instead outside that jurisdiction? I mean, there's a -- there's a -- there's a choice here, depending on whether there's a mobile interception device, right? If there's a mobile interception device, you can approve interception more widely than if there's not a mobile interception device. So I would think looking at this statute -- and I recognize that it's not included in one of the things that's said in Number 4, but that Number 3, you know, just implicitly requires a court to say which one it is, is it just within the jurisdiction or is it outside the jurisdiction, because there's a mobile interception device at issue. Well, how is -- I guess what I'm saying is -- I appreciate that -- but how is anybody to know unless the court says that? I mean, they're not going to know what they can do unless the court says what they can do. But let me say this another way, Mr. Tripp. On 17, it says: Each order authorizing or approving the interception shall specify. And you're right, the jurisdictional thing does not appear in this list. But then, if you look at 16a, what is an order authorizing or approving the interception, on 16a in paragraph 3, it says, well, the judge enters an order authorizing or approving interception, either within the territorial jurisdiction or outside that jurisdiction, depending on whether there's this mobile interception device. So it just does seem to me that that's just got to be a necessary part of an order authorizing the interception. Where is the interception supposed to take place? Either within the jurisdiction or outside, depending on whether there's a mobile interception device. It's just got to be in the order because, otherwise, how would you know -- -- which of those two possible things is true? Well, no, but it is an either/or because if it's -- if there's a mobile interception device, it's both. And if it's not a mobile interception device, it's only one. And that's a disjunctive thing, it's only one or it's both? Mr. Tripp -- I'm sorry, finish your sentence. Well, if you're really -- When you say ""insufficient,"" I mean, you know, the Chief Justice raises a very good point that ""insufficient"" doesn't usually mean invalid, that it usually means lacking something. So then the question is, well, was this order lacking something? And you say no, it wasn't because it didn't have to have anything about the jurisdictional reach of the interception. And I guess I'm a little bit concerned listening to you, if we -- if we accepted that, how are these orders supposed to read? We're going to go tell every court you don't have to put anything in your order about whether this is only within the jurisdiction or outside that jurisdiction? Because, again, there are really two choices in the statute depending upon whether a mobile interception device is -- is at issue. And if we say, well, this is not insufficient because you don't have to have that, what are we going to be creating, a world of orders in which the judge doesn't tell anybody whether this is within the jurisdiction or whether it's also outside the jurisdiction? I guess -- I mean, if we're talking about easy ways to resolve this case, I have to say the more I think about this, the more it seems really complicated to me, what's supposed to be in these orders and what's not supposed to be in these orders. The only thing I'm sure of in this case is that there's no core concern requirement. So why isn't that the easy way to decide this case and leave everything else for cases where actually people have briefed and addressed these questions of what has to be in and what has to be out and when you can call something insufficient and when not? ",where do you see it in the statute as require that be your be your view dependent on our accepting that that it be not only a foundational requirement but that it be a foundational requirement that have to be on the face of the order well irrespective of whether the jurisdiction have to be state on the face of the order well mr shan but mr tripp if if if you if the order do not have to include anything about territorial jurisdiction how be anybody to know whether it approve interception only within the territorial jurisdiction or instead outside that jurisdiction i mean there be a there have a there be a choice here depend on whether there be a mobile interception device right if there be a mobile interception device you can approve interception more widely than if there be not a mobile interception device so i would think look at this statute and i recognize that it be not include in one of the thing that be say in number but that number you know just implicitly require a court to say which one it be be it just within the jurisdiction or be it outside the jurisdiction because there be a mobile interception device at issue well how be i guess what I be say be i appreciate that but how be anybody to know unless the court say that i mean they be not go to know what they can do unless the court say what they can do but let me say this another way mr tripp on it say each order authorize or approve the interception shall specify and you be right the jurisdictional thing do not appear in this list but then if you look at a what be an order authorizing or approve the interception on a in paragraph it say well the judge enter an order authorizing or approve interception either within the territorial jurisdiction or outside that jurisdiction depend on whether there be this mobile interception device so it just do seem to me that that be just get to be a necessary part of an order authorize the interception where be the interception suppose to take place either within the jurisdiction or outside depend on whether there be a mobile interception device it be just get to be in the order because otherwise how would you know which of those two possible thing be true well no but it be an eitheror because if it be if there be a mobile interception device it be both and if it be not a mobile interception device it be only one and that be a disjunctive thing it be only one or it be both mr tripp I be sorry finish your sentence well if you be really when you say insufficient i mean you know the chief justice raise a very good point that insufficient do not usually mean invalid that it usually mean lack something so then the question be well be this order lack something and you say no it be not because it do not have to have anything about the jurisdictional reach of the interception and i guess I be a little bit concerned listen to you if we if we accept that how be these order suppose to read we be go to go tell every court you do not have to put anything in your order about whether this be only within the jurisdiction or outside that jurisdiction because again there be really two choice in the statute depend upon whether a mobile interception device be be at issue and if we say well this be not insufficient because you do not have to have that what be we go to be create a world of order in which the judge do not tell anybody whether this be within the jurisdiction or whether it be also outside the jurisdiction i guess i mean if we be talk about easy way to resolve this case i have to say the more i think about this the more it seem really complicate to me what be suppose to be in these order and what be not suppose to be in these order the only thing I be sure of in this case be that there be no core concern requirement so why be not that the easy way to decide this case and leave everything else for case where actually people have brief and address these question of what have to be in and what have to be out and when you can call something insufficient and when not ,246.64,Roberts Court,"Feb 21, 2018","Los Rovell Dahda, et al.",United States of America,17-43,"Oct 16, 2017","May 14, 2018",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2017,Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, why is it directed there if it doesn't say that? I mean, in fact, we said the opposite in Eastex. We said employees seeking to improve working conditions through resort to administrative and judicial forums, essentially the legislatures and the courthouses and the agencies, is covered by the mutual aid or protection clause. So, you know, in Eastex, we came up against this question, said it was very clear that the mutual aid and protection clause swept further than the workplace itself, as long as the ultimate goals were workplace-related, whether you took those goals to the -- in the -- you know, activity in the workplace or in the agencies or in the courts, it didn't matter at all, it was all covered by Section 7. Well, Mr. Clement -- Mr. Clement, what about -- What about Section 102 and 103 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act? Because let's take Justice Kennedy's example. You have three guys and they all join claims, so we don't have the question about a class action and whether that's concerted. This is clearly concerted. And they're seeking higher wages, so it's clearly for their mutual aid and protection. So they're covered under Section 7. And then Section 102 of the NLGA basically just repeats Section 7. And then Section 103 says -- and I'm quoting now -- ""Any undertaking or promise in conflict with"" -- essentially the language in Section 7 -- ""Shall not be enforceable in any court."" So what about that? Any undertaking or promise in conflict with Section 7 rights; in other words, any waiver of Section 7 rights ""Shall not be enforceable in any court?"" The only thing it assumed was that this was covered under Section 7. And you -- You yourself said this is concerted and it's for mutual aid and protection. And once that's true, this language of Norris-LaGuardia comes in and says forget about a waiver because an undertaking in conflict with Section 7 shall not be enforceable. Well, it's an agreement, but it's an agreement to waive a Section 7 right. I mean, that's what it is. It's saying I used to have this right for concerted activity, and now I don't. Mr. Wall, can I interrupt you because -- Justice Alito has one and then I do. I take it that both you and Mr. Clement agree that, if you had a discriminatory arbitration agreement, let's say an arbitration agreement that said that the employer will pay the arbitration costs of men but not women, that that would not be enforceable. Why not? Okay. So, if that's the case and you're saying there can be a conflict between statutes and the Title VII would supply a clear congressional command, even though Title VII says absolutely nothing about arbitration. Well, here's -- here's one understanding -- may I continue? Is one understanding of Title VII says to the employer, you shall not discriminate, and Section 7 says to the employer, you shall not interfere with concerted activity, such as three guys joining together to bring a suit if they want to. Mr. Griffin, is this one way to think about the question? Of course, Section 7 doesn't extend to the ends of the Earth. If there are three employees who go out jointly rioting in the streets, they run up against anti-riot laws and they go to jail just like everybody else. What Section 7 does and what Section 8 does is to establish a set of rules that deal with how employers can deal with employees. And one of the things that Section 7 and Section 8 say in concert, if you will, is that employers can't demand as conditions of employment the waivers of concerted rights. And that's all you're saying here. Do you have a view, Mr. Griffin, as to whether bringing a class action is itself concerted activity by a single named plaintiff? But, Mr. Clement, usually, usually when you have a right, the fact that there is one way to exercise a right left over does not make it okay if we've taken away another 25 ways of exercising the right. You know, when we think about the First Amendment, we don't say we can ban leafleting because you can always write an op ed. And the same thing applies here. The fact that there's something left over by way of concerted activity does not make it okay under Section 7 and Section 8 to deprive employees of many other means of protected activity. ",well why be it direct there if it do not say that i mean in fact we say the opposite in eastex we say employee seek to improve work condition through resort to administrative and judicial forum essentially the legislature and the courthouse and the agency be cover by the mutual aid or protection clause so you know in eastex we come up against this question say it be very clear that the mutual aid and protection clause sweep far than the workplace itself as long as the ultimate goal we be workplace relate whether you take those goal to the in the you know activity in the workplace or in the agency or in the court it do not matter at all it be all cover by section well mr clement mr clement what about what about section and of the norris laguardia act because let us take justice kennedy s example you have three guy and they all join claim so we do not have the question about a class action and whether that be concert this be clearly concert and they be seek high wage so it be clearly for their mutual aid and protection so they be cover under section and then section of the nlga basically just repeat section and then section say and I be quote now any undertaking or promise in conflict with essentially the language in section shall not be enforceable in any court so what about that any undertaking or promise in conflict with section right in other word any waiver of section right shall not be enforceable in any court the only thing it assume be that this be cover under section and you you yourself say this be concert and it be for mutual aid and protection and once that be true this language of norris laguardia come in and say forget about a waiver because an undertaking in conflict with section shall not be enforceable well it be an agreement but it be an agreement to waive a section right i mean that be what it be it be say i use to have this right for concerted activity and now i do not mr wall can i interrupt you because justice alito have one and then i do i take it that both you and mr clement agree that if you have a discriminatory arbitration agreement let us say an arbitration agreement that say that the employer will pay the arbitration cost of men but not woman that that would not be enforceable why not okay so if that be the case and you be say there can be a conflict between statute and the title vii would supply a clear congressional command even though title vii say absolutely nothing about arbitration well here s here s one understanding may i continue be one understanding of title vii say to the employer you shall not discriminate and section say to the employer you shall not interfere with concerted activity such as three guy join together to bring a suit if they want to mr griffin be this one way to think about the question of course section do not extend to the end of the earth if there be three employee who go out jointly riot in the street they run up against anti riot law and they go to jail just like everybody else what section do and what section do be to establish a set of rule that deal with how employer can deal with employee and one of the thing that section and section say in concert if you will be that employer can not demand as condition of employment the waiver of concerted right and that be all you be say here do you have a view mr griffin as to whether bring a class action be itself concerted activity by a single name plaintiff but mr clement usually usually when you have a right the fact that there be one way to exercise a right left over do not make it okay if we have take away another way of exercise the right you know when we think about the first amendment we do not say we can ban leafleting because you can always write an op ed and the same thing applies here the fact that there be something leave over by way of concerted activity do not make it okay under section and section to deprive employee of many other mean of protected activity ,271.28000000000003,Roberts Court,"Oct 2, 2017",Epic Systems Corporation,Jacob Lewis,16-285,"Jan 13, 2017","May 21, 2018",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2017,Class v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"Ms. Amunson, would you tell me if your theory is different than or the same as the following theory? One way to look at this is just to say that a plea substitutes for a trial and a verdict at that trial. So the line that we should be drawing is any issue that would have been decided at trial is foreclosed, unless there is -- you know, unless there's been an explicit statement in the plea agreement, and any other is not foreclosed. Is -- is -- is that the right line or are you drawing a different line? And, if so, why? If he hadn't, there would be a different result? Mr. Feigin, it's awfully hard to say that the floodgates are opening when it's in the power of every U.S. Attorney to just write this into the plea agreement. So, Mr. Feigin, can I go to your basic 11, Rule 11 argument? Because what Rule 11 does, if you just look at the text of Rule 11, it says here are the conditions in which you can enter a conditional guilty plea, you know, you have to get some consents, and then you can enter a conditional guilty plea. It doesn't say what happens if you don't do that. There's nothing in Rule 11 that says and the consequence of not entering a conditional guilty plea is X, Y, Z. So you have to look outside the rule for the consequence of not entering a conditional guilty plea. And it seems to me that the place you look, the question you ask is, well, what's the inherent effect of that guilty plea? So Rule 11 just tells you, you know, go try to figure out what the inherent effect of the guilty plea is, and what's covered by it, and, on the other hand, what's not. So I don't see how Rule 11 really is the answer to this question. Rule 11 just sets up the problem. Can I -- can I -- can I ask, Mr. Feigin, how the rule that you are espousing fits with the language that we've used in Blackledge and Menna and Broce? Because when I look at those cases, the language that we use seems totally consistent with the theory that Justice Gorsuch and Justice Breyer raised, and not consistent with yours. So when they were talking about what -- what -- what's not precluded by a guilty plea, they say, well, where you have a right not to be hailed into court at all, they say where the charge is one that the state cannot constitutionally prosecute; that last one is from Menna, and they say where the court had no power to enter the conviction; that last one is from Broce. So, in all three of those cases, the language used is where, you know, in the end you find that the -- that you've -- you've -- you've done the facts, you've satisfied the elements, but still the state can't prosecute you constitutionally or properly. And that's exactly what fits with Justice Gorsuch's and Justice Breyer's theory. Three -- three times we've said it. ",ms amunson would you tell me if your theory be different than or the same as the follow theory one way to look at this be just to say that a plea substitute for a trial and a verdict at that trial so the line that we should be draw be any issue that would have be decide at trial be foreclose unless there be you know unless there be be an explicit statement in the plea agreement and any other be not foreclose be be be that the right line or be you draw a different line and if so why if he have not there would be a different result mr feigin it be awfully hard to say that the floodgate be open when it be in the power of every us attorney to just write this into the plea agreement so mr feigin can i go to your basic rule argument because what rule do if you just look at the text of rule it say here be the condition in which you can enter a conditional guilty plea you know you have to get some consent and then you can enter a conditional guilty plea it do not say what happen if you do not do that there be nothing in rule that say and the consequence of not enter a conditional guilty plea be x y z so you have to look outside the rule for the consequence of not enter a conditional guilty plea and it seem to me that the place you look the question you ask be well what be the inherent effect of that guilty plea so rule just tell you you know go try to figure out what the inherent effect of the guilty plea be and what be cover by it and on the other hand what be not so i do not see how rule really be the answer to this question rule just set up the problem can i can i can i ask mr feigin how the rule that you be espouse fit with the language that we have use in blackledge and menna and broce because when i look at those case the language that we use seem totally consistent with the theory that justice gorsuch and justice breyer raise and not consistent with yours so when they we be talk about what what what be not preclude by a guilty plea they say well where you have a right not to be hail into court at all they say where the charge be one that the state can not constitutionally prosecute that last one be from menna and they say where the court have no power to enter the conviction that last one be from broce so in all three of those case the language use be where you know in the end you find that the that you have you have you have do the fact you have satisfy the element but still the state can not prosecute you constitutionally or properly and that be exactly what fit with justice gorsuch s and justice breyer s theory three three time we have say it ,183.64,Roberts Court,"Oct 4, 2017",Rodney Class,United States of America,16-424,"Feb 21, 2017","Feb 21, 2018",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2017,Wilson v. Sellers,114,Elena Kagan,"Ms. Warren, can I just ask a question about the breadth of your position? It's a little bit confusing to me from the briefs. You spent a lot of time talking about the word ""decision"" and how habeas review is only available for decisions, not for opinions. So does your argument go that even when the -- a state court, the higher state court has issued a reasoned decision, that even there the habeas court is not limited to that decision but can and should decide whether there are other grounds? I'm not sure I understand the question. But suppose you said that the reasoned decision is -- is not -- is just completely wrong. Could you substitute, you know, so I think the way I've understood that that goes is that's completely wrong, so now we don't -- we don't give deference to it, right? It's taken itself out of AEDPA because it's completely wrong. Are you saying, no, there's a second step where you have to say, well, if I were the judge, I could have written a better decision that would receive AEDPA deference? So, Ms. Warren, I take that, but it seems to me that that's the question, right? What should we presume about what the Georgia Supreme Court is doing here in -- in exactly the way you said? So let me give you a hypothetical. Let's say we have a Batson case and there was a denial of relief in the Batson case. And -- but it was based on a very clear error of law. So somebody said -- it's a Hispanic defendant, and somebody said Hispanic defendants are not entitled to raise Batson claims. All right? And -- and then the -- the supreme court, the state supreme court just says affirmed. All right? So what should we understand about that? Why -- why is the state court doing that? What -- what -- what's the reasonable assumption about what the state court is doing? You see, this is -- it seems a very odd thing to say the Georgia Supreme Court looked at an opinion and said that is such a bad opinion, it has such a clear error of federal constitutional law, but we are not going to explain that to anybody. Instead we're just going to affirm. Now, that's one option. The other option is that the Georgia Supreme Court had a bad day, and it too made an error. And the question is, and I suppose, you know, Ylst answered this question, but it seemed to me to answer it in a pretty reasonable way. It's like we just don't expect state supreme courts to say that's a clear error of federal constitutional law and we are not going to tell anybody about it. No, no, no. Here there is, there's another basis, but -- but you have to believe that what the state court is saying, even though this -- this lower state court made an error of federal constitutional law, because we can dream up something better, we'll just affirm it. We won't tell anybody what we're -- what we think is an alternative basis. We won't do anything. We'll just let it be out there. That judge will think that he's done a fine job. Everybody else will think that he's done a fine job. We'll just leave it out there because, what, because we can't be bothered to write two sentences saying, you know, we're affirming on a ground where, you know, yes, of course, he's entitled to make a Batson claim, but he had a bad Batson claim? I mean, it seems to me that that just makes a bizarre assumption about state courts, that they're so uninterested in errors of federal constitutional law that they're just going to say, well, as long as we have something in our heads that suggests that the ultimate judgment was right, we're not going to tell anybody about them. We're going to leave them out there as -- as something that the judge and the parties and -- and future judges and future parties will think was right when we know it's wrong. Well, didn't Ylst tell us what we should generally draw from silence? It just says the maxim is that silence implies consent, not the opposite. Courts generally behave accordingly, not always, but generally affirming when -- without further discussion when they agree, not when they disagree, with the reasons given below. And that was -- you know, there was a different context. As you say, it was procedural versus merits. But that basic reasoning was not limited to -- to the context. It was -- it was a more general understanding of what silence means, or generally should be taken to mean, with respect to state supreme courts. Why wasn't it right? What if the -- the state supreme court says, you know, we think that this opinion is clearly wrong, but we're going to -- we're good lawyers and we're going to think of another opinion that could have been written. It wasn't, but it could have been. And -- and we're going to affirm on that ground. Of course, we're not going to say this; we're just going to say affirm. But -- but the thing that I'm thinking is this habeas petitioner has never been presented with this alternative argument. So it might be that this habeas petitioner would have a really good response to this alternative argument, but he doesn't even know that it's in the case. That seems quite unfair to the habeas petitioner, to say your petition is denied, not to tell him why, even though he's never been given the chance to respond to this new reasoning. ",ms warren can i just ask a question about the breadth of your position it be a little bit confuse to me from the brief you spend a lot of time talk about the word decision and how habeas review be only available for decision not for opinion so do your argument go that even when the a state court the high state court have issue a reasoned decision that even there the habeas court be not limit to that decision but can and should decide whether there be other ground I be not sure i understand the question but suppose you say that the reasoned decision be be not be just completely wrong could you substitute you know so i think the way I have understand that that go be that be completely wrong so now we do not we do not give deference to it right it be take itself out of aedpa because it be completely wrong be you say no there be a second step where you have to say well if i we be the judge i could have write a good decision that would receive aedpa deference so ms warren i take that but it seem to me that that be the question right what should we presume about what the georgia supreme court be do here in in exactly the way you say so let me give you a hypothetical let us say we have a batson case and there be a denial of relief in the batson case and but it be base on a very clear error of law so somebody say it be a hispanic defendant and somebody say hispanic defendant be not entitle to raise batson claim all right and and then the the supreme court the state supreme court just say affirm all right so what should we understand about that why why be the state court do that what what what be the reasonable assumption about what the state court be do you see this be it seem a very odd thing to say the georgia supreme court look at an opinion and say that be such a bad opinion it have such a clear error of federal constitutional law but we be not go to explain that to anybody instead we be just go to affirm now that be one option the other option be that the georgia supreme court have a bad day and it too make an error and the question be and i suppose you know ylst answer this question but it seem to me to answer it in a pretty reasonable way it be like we just do not expect state supreme court to say that be a clear error of federal constitutional law and we be not go to tell anybody about it no no no here there be there be another basis but but you have to believe that what the state court be say even though this this low state court make an error of federal constitutional law because we can dream up something well we will just affirm it we will not tell anybody what we be what we think be an alternative basis we will not do anything we will just let it be out there that judge will think that he be do a fine job everybody else will think that he be do a fine job we will just leave it out there because what because we can not be bother to write two sentence say you know we be affirm on a ground where you know yes of course he be entitle to make a batson claim but he have a bad batson claim i mean it seem to me that that just make a bizarre assumption about state court that they be so uninterested in error of federal constitutional law that they be just go to say well as long as we have something in our head that suggest that the ultimate judgment be right we be not go to tell anybody about them we be go to leave them out there as as something that the judge and the party and and future judge and future party will think be right when we know it be wrong well do not ylst tell us what we should generally draw from silence it just say the maxim be that silence implies consent not the opposite court generally behave accordingly not always but generally affirm when without further discussion when they agree not when they disagree with the reason give below and that be you know there be a different context as you say it be procedural versus merit but that basic reasoning be not limit to to the context it be it be a more general understanding of what silence mean or generally should be take to mean with respect to state supreme court why be not it right what if the the state supreme court say you know we think that this opinion be clearly wrong but we be go to we be good lawyer and we be go to think of another opinion that could have be write it be not but it could have be and and we be go to affirm on that ground of course we be not go to say this we be just go to say affirm but but the thing that I be think be this habeas petitioner have never be present with this alternative argument so it might be that this habeas petitioner would have a really good response to this alternative argument but he do not even know that it be in the case that seem quite unfair to the habeas petitioner to say your petition be

2017,"Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro",114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Clement -- -- you said the literal meaning. And you have some good arguments, but I have to tell you I don't think that that's the best one of them. Just if you think of what servicing means -- this is one dictionary, but basically all dictionaries say the same thing -- it means to perform services of maintenance, supply, repair, installation -- as to service a car. So it actually means to do the work, to do the repair, to do the maintenance -- I think would be the most ordinary understanding of what servicing means. So it does seem as though, for all the arguments that you do have, that one cuts against you, that, you know, just the ordinary meaning of what it means to be engaged in servicing automobiles is to be repairing, maintaining, fixing cars. So I -- that is one of the better arguments, I think, is what -- what ""partsman"" is doing in this, but I think I'm still suggesting, before we get on to that, that if you took partsman out of this statute, I don't really think that you'd have a leg to stand on here, that we would just naturally mean, well, servicing automobiles is like fixing them. And what -- and the service providers, they have something to do with servicing, to be sure, but they're not doing the servicing. What they're doing is selling service products. One of the amicus briefs talks about what partsmen did historically and makes the case that what partsmen did when this statute was passed is a little bit different from what -- or a lot different from what a partsman does now, in the sense that when this statute was passed, there were not readily available, ready-made, off-the-shelf parts. And what partsmen really did was kind of get under the hood and try to strip engines and play with the parts and adjust parts. And, you know, it was very much more part of the repair process than somebody who was taking things off the shelf. So can I try a hypothetical on you? And the hypothetical statute is designed to match this one in structure and -- and -- and to present the same question. So here's the language: Any salesman, designer, or seamstress primarily engaged in selling or making dresses. All right? So there we -- we know the seamstress is involved in making dresses. We know the salesman is involved in selling dresses. The designer is the partsman. And you could say, look, the designers, they're not actually sitting there with the needle, but they're still sort of making the dresses. That's the partsman. And then the question is, would you really say that the salesman is making the dresses too? But, Mr. Clement -- Could we -- Could I ask your indulgence -- -- and just before you talk to -- about purposes? Just, you know, my -- what my hypothetical was designed to do, and I came up with a bunch of them and I'll spare you -- (Laughter.) -- is to have a three-to-two correspondence. Your answer back to Justice Breyer was right away: Well, your hypotheticals have a two-to-two correspondence and that's different. My hypothetical had a three-to-two correspondence and you had to do a little bit of stretching to get one of the -- the middle term in. But the question is does that force you to stress -- to stretch so much that you get the first term in, when the first term pretty naturally pairs with the other, with the -- with the selling word, and that's what you're asking us to do. And I think to put the point more generally, the fact that you have to do a little bit of stretching to get partsmen in does not compel you to do a lot of stretching to get salesmen in. Now you're daring me. (Laughter.) When I think of these three categories of workers, so service providers, partsmen, mechanics, to coin a couple of silly kind of words, a service advisor is customer-facing. You know, it's -- the -- the primary -- the primary job is to deal with customers, to sell them things, to liaison with them, to make sure they're happy. Mechanics, and also partsmen, are car-facing. You know, their job is to do stuff with the car. And, you know, in different ways, the partsman is more helping, but their -- their focus is on the automobile, whereas the service provider's focus is on the customer. That seems to me a pretty big divide, suggesting that the service providers are really, you know, salesmen, not servicers. Is -- is everybody who's in a service department -- does everybody count as primarily engaged in servicing automobiles who's in a service department, the receptionist, the filers? How about if the service advisor -- But your definition of servicing, which I think is a very natural one, I mean, and not just, you know, natural, it's the dictionary definition of servicing, but it has to cope with this partsmen word. How does -- how do partsmen fit within your definition of servicing? Mr. Feldman, when -- when you talked about the purposes, you focused on the fact that service advisors work on-site and don't work irregular hours. I believe that Mr. Clement's argument, and he'll correct me if I'm wrong, focuses on the fact of commissions, that these people, like other kinds of salesmen and like mechanics, are often compensated through commission schemes. What about that? Mr. Feldman, the Solicitor General is not here in a case in which one would expect the government to be here. Do you know whether there's any activity taking place in the Department of Labor with respect to this issue? ",mr clement you say the literal meaning and you have some good argument but i have to tell you i do not think that that be the best one of them just if you think of what service mean this be one dictionary but basically all dictionary say the same thing it mean to perform service of maintenance supply repair installation as to service a car so it actually mean to do the work to do the repair

2017,Artis v. District of Columbia,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, Ms. AliKhan, suppose you just had a statute and the ""for a period of 30 days"" was excised from it, so it's ""shall be tolled"" while the claim is pending unless state law provides for a longer tolling period. Would anybody read that statute to mean anything other than the clock is stopped and resumes again -- -- once the thing is dismissed? Well, it does have an ordinary meaning, but, honestly, until I read your brief, I just sort of thought that the ordinary meaning was ""suspend,"" stop the clock, so -- and then later, on some trigger point, the clock starts running again. And I -- you know, I had to go to the dictionaries to look up what you were saying it meant; whereas, you know, if I'm just any old lawyer, ""tolled"" means one thing when it's -- when it's referring to a statute of limitations. I mean, it means something else when you're driving on the highway, but when it's referring to a statute of limitations, it means you stop the clock. Well, Ms. AliKhan, I want you to assume something with me, but then I want to give you an opportunity to do something, all right? So I want you to assume with me that if the words ""and for a period of 30 days"" were not in the statute, that we wouldn't be here, that we would read this as a normal stop-clock tolling period, and -- and that the question that arises from the statute and the reason we are all here comes from the addition of these words ""and for a period of 30 days."" And I just want you to tell me why you think the addition of those words should make us read the statutes differently. But this is 53911(d) statute, which does exactly that, used the word suspended except other than tolled. But it -- it -- it basically does exactly that. It stops the clock and then adds some time. No, I don't think that that's right because they say tolled all the time -- -- to say stop the clock. What I'm saying is that the concept of this is used, I mean, it's not used commonly, but it has been used in at least one other statute. As kind of stop-clock plus. But there's a very easy way to write a statute like the one that you think this one is. I mean, Congress has done it. All the states have done it. I'll just read you one of Congress's: ""In the event that any action is timely brought and is thereafter dismissed, the action may be recommenced within one year."" I mean, that's a very simple way of writing a grace period statute. Thirty states have done the exact same thing. Nobody writes a grace period statute like this. I guess I'm -- I'm not sure I understand that answer. I mean -- I mean, here, I'm not going to speak in the language of a statute, but essentially Congress would just be saying when the pendant claim is dismissed, the person has 30 days to refile in state court. That's a pretty easy way to state that thing. No, but they wanted a stop-clock plus 30 days. And that makes some sense. I mean, it's not the only thing that makes sense. But Congress might have thought we want a stop-clock statute for all the reasons that we often have stop-clock statutes, and then we want to give people 30 days just to make sure that the person who's filing on the last day has a little bit of time. Now, you know, is that the only thing Congress could have done? No. But, you know, it makes perfect sense. Well, here, how about this? How about -- Ms. AliKhan, I mean, maybe one thing that -- that Justice Breyer should read is Jinks, where the Court already upheld Congress's authority to pass 1367(d) under the necessary and proper clause. And in doing so, it relied on an earlier decision of this Court, which upheld a federal provision that tolled state statutes of limitations by means of stop-clock suspension. So, that would seem to sort of put the kibosh on this argument, wouldn't it? Well, but it was used -- -- I mean, it was -- but Jinks was -- was talking about this very statute and relied on Kahn to make the point that federal provisions that toll state statutes of limitations are perfectly constitutional under the necessary and proper clause, didn't it? Yes, point taken, point taken, but it upheld -- but it -- but it cited and relied on a case where exactly this kind of suspension was at issue. And you can say yes that was in a different context, but Jinks was using it for this context. ",well ms alikhan suppose you just have a statute and the for a period of day be excise from it so it be shall be toll while the claim be pending unless state law provide for a longer tolling period would anybody read that statute to mean anything other than the clock be stop and resume again once the thing be dismiss well it do have an ordinary meaning but honestly until i read your brief i just sort of thought that the ordinary meaning be suspend stop the clock so and then later on some trigger point the clock start run again and i you know i have to go to the dictionary to look up what you we be say it mean whereas you know if I be just any old lawyer toll mean one thing when it be when it be refer to a statute of limitation i mean it mean something else when you be drive on the highway but when it be refer to a statute of limitation it mean you stop the clock well ms alikhan i want you to assume something with me but then i want to give you an opportunity to do something all right so i want you to assume with me that if the word and for a period of day we be not in the statute that we would not be here that we would read this as a normal stop clock toll period and and that the question that arise from the statute and the reason we be all here come from the addition of these word and for a period of day and i just want you to tell me why you think the addition of those word should make us read the statute differently but this be d statute which do exactly that use the word suspend except other than toll but it it it basically do exactly that it stop the clock and then add some time no i do not think that that be right because they say toll all the time to say stop the clock what I be say be that the concept of this be use i mean it be not use commonly but it have be use in at least one other statute as kind of stop clock plus but there be a very easy way to write a statute like the one that you think this one be i mean congress have do it all the state have do it I will just read you one of congress s in the event that any action be timely brought and be thereafter dismiss the action may be recommence within one year i mean that be a very simple way of write a grace period statute thirty state have do the exact same thing nobody write a grace period statute like this i guess I be I be not sure i understand that answer i mean i mean here I be not go to speak in the language of a statute but essentially congress would just be say when the pendant claim be dismiss the person have day to refile in state court that be a pretty easy way to state that thing no but they want a stop clock plus day and that make some sense i mean it be not the only thing that make sense but congress might have think we want a stop clock statute for all the reason that we often have stop clock statute and then we want to give people day just to make sure that the person who be file on the last day have a little bit of time now you know be that the only thing congress could have do no but you know it make perfect sense well here how about this how about ms alikhan i mean maybe one thing that that justice breyer should read be jinks where the court already uphold congress s authority to pass d under the necessary and proper clause and in do so it rely on an early decision of this court which uphold a federal provision that toll state statute of limitation by mean of stop clock suspension so that would seem to sort of put the kibosh on this argument would not it well but it be use i mean it be but jinks be be talk about this very statute and rely on kahn to make the point that federal provision that toll state statute of limitation be perfectly constitutional under the necessary and proper clause do not it yes point take point take but it uphold but it but it cite and rely on a case where exactly this kind of suspension be at issue and you can say yes that be in a different context but jinks be use it for this context ,238.36,Roberts Court,"Nov 1, 2017",Stephanie C.

Why shouldn't we just look at 2703 and ask what Congress was trying to do in that section? Well, how do we know really?

What Congress was doing was to regulate the disclosure anywhere in the world of electronic communications that are stored in the United States.

2017,Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, what does that mean? What would you be looking for, when you say that the federal government took responsibility? I mean, suppose that the federal government had just said we don't want states to regulate. We don't want to regulate ourselves; we just want -- I think this is what Justice Breyer's question was -- a free market. So is that enough responsibility that the federal government has taken? I guess what I'm asking, Mr. Olson, is you're suggesting that the federal government, in order to preempt state activity, has to itself enact some kind of comprehensive regulatory scheme; and the question is, you know, how -- what would we be looking for if that -- if that were our test? When do we know that they've enacted a sufficiently comprehensive regulatory scheme in order to allow preemption of state rules? Mr. Olson -- So suppose I read these cases as setting up a principle that the federal government can't conscript state officials for its own purposes, you know, the federal government can -- does whatever it wants, consistent with the Commerce Clause, but it can't conscript state officials in order to do -- help them -- help the federal government do it. If that's the way I see these cases, what's being -- who is being conscripted in order to do what here? Yeah, so -- I mean, just the way you say that, Mr. Olson -- the federal government is saying to the states you can't do something -- so that sounds to me the language of preemption. All the time the federal government takes some kind of action, passes a law, and then says to the states: you know what, we've got this; you can't do anything. So do you see no difference between the federal government saying to a state, look, you can't take some preferred policy option that you would like to take, and, on the other hand, the federal government saying to a state, you must help us do something? Because I thought that our cases were all about the second thing. You must help us. You must be our little assistants when we promote or try to advance a policy objective. And I -- I guess what I'm asking you for is how is New Jersey being put in that position with respect to this statute? What -- what partial -- what partial repeals are not forbidden? What could the state do? Mr. Clement, what -- what's the line you would draw as between preemption and commandeering? So what's the difference between saying you must pass a certain piece of legislation and saying you must maintain a piece of legislation on the books? How is it different from that?

And why -- why wouldn't that person or the hairstylist -- why wouldn't that also count? I mean, some people might say that about cakes, you know? But you have a -- you have a view that a cake can be speech because it -- it involves great skill and artistry. And I guess I'm wondering, if that's the case, you know, how do you draw a line? How do you decide, oh, of course, the chef and the baker are on one side, and you said, I think, the florist is on that side, the chef, the baker, the florist, versus the hairstylist or the makeup artist? I mean, where would you put a tailor, a tailor who makes a wonderful suit of clothes? Where does that come in? But why well, why -- well -- woah. The baker is engaged in speech, but the chef is not engaged in speech? Is this just a -- But, I'm sorry, could I just -- -- understand your -- But if I could just, sorry, very quickly, I know your light is on and I'm sure you'll be given a little bit of an adjustment. Is that okay? (Laughter.) I guess I just didn't understand your answers to Justice Sotomayor's question. Same case or not the same case, if your client instead objected to an interracial marriage? Not the same. How about if he objected to an interreligious? Similar to what? You're just saying race is different? I mean, I don't want to put words in your mouth. I -- I just really, you know, just want to know the answer. Mr. -- So, General, you started by -- General, it -- it seems as though there are kind of three axes on which people are asking you what's the line? How do we draw the line? So one axis is what we started with, like what about the chef and the florist -- -- and -- and, you know, everybody else that participates -- -- in a wedding? A second axis is, well, why is this only about gay people? Why isn't it about race? Why isn't it about gender? Why isn't it about people of different religions? So that's a second axis. And there's a third axis, which is why is it just about weddings? You say ceremonies, events. What else counts? Is it the funeral? Is it the Bar Mitzvah or the communion? Is it the anniversary celebration? Is it the birthday celebration? So there are all three of these that suggest like, whoa, this doesn't seem like such a small thing. And so let me just give you one hypothetical and then you can answer more broadly. Which, you know -- so let me -- I'll just pick one of those. It's like how about a -- a -- a -- a couple, a same-sex couple goes to a great restaurant with a great chef for an anniversary celebration, and the great chef says I don't do this for same-sex couples? How about that? Well, I'd like my example, please. (Laughter.) No, there is. The chef is expressing something about how he feels -- -- about same-sex couples and same-sex marriage. He doesn't want to celebrate a same- -- the anniversary of a same-sex marriage. Just like -- -- the baker doesn't want to celebrate a same-sex marriage. Well, I -- Mr. -- General, really, I mean, could -- could we just -- I -- I guess I'd like an answer to my hypothetical. So the baker is speech, but the -- the great chef who's like everything is perfect on the plate and it's a work of art, it's a masterpiece? Well, Ollie's Barbecue. Okay. How about the same cake, if you don't -- if you want to, as I understand it, you want to treat the chef differently from the baker, but let's say the same cake, and a couple comes in, a same-sex couple, and says it's our first-year anniversary, and we would like a special cake for it. Can he then say no -- no? No cake? It's a great cake. What do you mean is it the exact same cake? How about this -- What if somebody comes in, it's a baker who's an atheist and really can't stand any religion, and somebody comes in and says I want one of your very, very special, special cakes for a First Communion -- -- or for a Bar Mitzvah. And the baker says no, I don't -- I don't -- I don't do that. I don't want my cakes to be used -- -- in the context of a religious ceremony. I just want the answer. It's a special, special cake. Do we have to answer that question, Mr. Cole? ",m ms waggoner so could so the jeweler the hairstylist why be there no speech in in create a wonderful hairdo the makeup artist it be call an artist it be the makeup artist laughter but I be I be quite serious actually about this because you know a makeup artist i think might feel exactly as your client do that they be do something that be of of great aesthetic importance to the to the wedding and to and that there be a lot of skill and artistic vision that go into make a somebody look beautiful and why why would not that person or the hairstylist why would not that also count i mean some people might say that about cake you know but you have a you have a view that a cake can be speech because it it involve great skill and artistry and i guess I be wonder if that be the case you know how do you draw a line how do you decide oh of course the chef and the baker be on one side and you say i think the florist be on that side the chef the baker the florist versus the hairstylist or the makeup artist i mean where would you put a tailor a tailor who make a wonderful suit of clothes where do that come in but why well why well woah the baker be engage in speech but the chef be not engage in speech be this just a but I be sorry could i just understand your but if i could just sorry very quickly i know your light be on and I be sure you will be give a little bit of an adjustment be that okay laughter i guess i just do not understand your answer to justice sotomayor s question same case or not the same case if your client instead object to an interracial marriage not the same how about if he object to an interreligious similar to what you be just say race be different i mean i do not want to put word in your mouth i i just really you know just want to know the answer mr so general you start by general it it seem as though there be kind of three ax on which people be ask you what be the line how do we draw the line so one axis be what we start with like what about the chef and the florist and and you know everybody else that participates in a wedding a second axis be well why be this only about gay people why be not it about race why be not it about gender why be not it about people of different religion so that be a second axis and there be a third axis which be why be it just about wedding you say ceremony event what else count be it the funeral be it the bar mitzvah or the communion be it the anniversary celebration be it the birthday celebration so there be all three of these that suggest like whoa this do not seem like such a small thing and so let me just give you one hypothetical and then you can answer more broadly which you know so let me I will just pick one of those it be like how about a a a a couple a same sex couple go to a great restaurant with a great chef for an anniversary celebration and the great chef say i do not do this for same sex couple how about that well I would like my example please laughter no there be the chef be express something about how he feel about same sex couple and same sex marriage he do not want to celebrate a same the anniversary of a same sex marriage just like the baker do not want to celebrate a same sex marriage well i mr general really i mean could could we just i i guess I would like an answer to my hypothetical so the baker be speech but the the great chef who be like everything be perfect on the plate and it be a work of art it be a masterpiece well ollie s barbecue okay how about the same cake if you do not if you want to as i understand it you want to treat the chef differently from the baker but let us say the same cake and a couple come in a same sex couple and say it be our first year anniversary and we would like a special cake for it can he then say no no no cake it be a great cake what do you mean be it the exact same cake how about this what if somebody come in it be a baker who be an atheist and really can not stand any religion and somebody come in and say i want one of your very very special special cake for a first communion or for a bar mitzvah and the baker say no i do not i do not i do not do that i do not want my cake to be use in the context of a religious ceremony i just want the answer it be a special special cake do we have to answer that question mr cole ,301.48000000000013,Roberts Court,"Dec 5, 2017","Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd.; and Jack C.

2017,"Cyan, Inc. v. Beaver County Employees' Retirement Fund",114,Elena Kagan,"Could we -- I'm sorry, could we -- could we just talk about the text before we speak about the purpose -- -- which -- because, you know, ""except as provided"" in 77p, the natural way to read that is we look at 77p, the whole thing, and we see what's the ""except"" that's provided in. We don't look to an ancillary definitional provision that all it does is define a term. We look for a rule that might be in conflict, that could be taken to be in conflict, with the jurisdictional provision. So, you know, it just seems as though your interpretation does a very odd thing, textually, when you read ""except as provided"" in Section 77p to say let's look to a definition in that section. Well, if your reading were right, Mr. Katyal, it would be written something like: Except with respect to class actions as defined in -- not as provided by -- as defined in 77p(f)(2), not just 77p. So there are two ways in which your reading really does seem at odds with the statutory text. First by not saying the -- the text says provided in, you're saying defined by, and, second, the -- the statute makes clear you look to 77p as a whole, not to some sub-subsection within it. Well, but you're -- you're forgetting that most securities actions are Exchange Act actions. They're not Securities Act actions. And for that, Congress did everything it wanted because Exchange Act actions are all in the federal courts. There is exclusive jurisdiction there. So essentially what was happening was that in Exchange Act actions, it -- that exclusive jurisdiction was being compromised by the ability of people to bring state law actions. And Congress completely shut that down. So Congress did everything it wanted with respect to Exchange Act actions, which are the lion's share of securities lawsuits. So, Mr. Kedem, so now I understand your argument, but -- but still it doesn't really fit with (b)(1) and (2). I mean, if it were just involving a covered security, as set forth in subsection (b), you would look to something which told you what a covered security is. But (b)(1) and (2) don't do that. They talk about, you know, the kind of conduct that's illegal. Could -- I just want to get the -- the best version of your argument. (1) and (2) involve a covered security because what? I'll -- I'll add to that. I mean, as I stare at it a little bit more, I wish I had asked Mr. Kedem, ""and shall be subject to subsection (b),"" because that suggests that it has to be dismissed, and you wouldn't want to dismiss the kind of cases that Mr. Kedem wants to remove. Yeah, but that would make ""and shall be subject to subsection (b)"" superfluous and -- and essentially mean nothing. Could I ask you, Mr. -- Mr. Goldstein, also on this (c) provision, and -- and this really ought to be a question for Mr. Kedem, but he sat down. But I don't want you to agree with me just for the sake of -- -- agreeing with me. But if I understand what he said, it's these class actions with this last antecedent principle, you're only referring to (1) and (2), so now you -- you make those class actions removable. But the way this provision works -- and you think kind of that makes sense, right? We would want those -- those actions to be removable, be consistent with Congress's other purposes -- -- but -- I'm sorry? Okay. I'm -- I'm saying what -- -- in his view, right? But then it says ""and shall be subject to subsection (b)."" And all that subsection (b) does, the way this (c) provision works is it makes a category of cases removable only so that a court can dismiss them. That's the point of subsection (c). It's like they were worried that state courts wouldn't just dismiss these actions, so it made them removable to be dismissed. But then you're getting those cases up there. You say, okay, we'll get them removable because these cases really ought to be in federal court, but under (c), now they have to be dismissed.

2017,Sessions v. Dimaya,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, may I ask, Mr. Kneedler, because this aspect of your brief was confusing to me because sometimes you're talking about temporal, and sometimes you're talking about functional. And I want to know what you think the real limitation is. So take the example that you use, which is the possession of a shotgun example; right? And you say that that would fall outside of Section 16. And the question is why? Temporally, you know, you're possessing a shotgun when you shoot somebody. You can't do it any other way. So the temporal analysis doesn't work. So what is it about that example that makes it fall outside of Section 16, whereas you argued it would have fallen inside of ACCA? Yes, exactly. So why are you so sure that there would not be the confusion under Section 16? Well, that's absolutely true. And that's what gave us trouble in ACCA because it could culminate in its use, but it didn't have to culminate in its use. But then you take a case like burglary, and you could say the exact same thing about burglary. Somebody could walk in on a burglary and all of a sudden there would be a use of force. But a burglary could happen in such a way that nobody walked in and there wouldn't be a use of force. So, again, it just seems as though we're replicating the same kind of confusions, and there's nothing that separates the two. Or at least I'm trying to find out -- -- what you think separates the two. You know -- -- I -- I was very struck by that language, too. And I think it's that language, more than some of the other language you pointed to in its brief, that might suggest that there's some distinction between 16(b) and -- and the ACCA residual clause. But on the other hand, ""by its nature"" seems to suggest an elements focus, a real elements focus. Look at the elements and ask, given those elements, given the nature of the offense, what's going to happen? But, you know, the elements section of Section 16 is Section 16(a) So it can't be all about all elements. So what is that ""by its nature"" doing? But why isn't also possession of a shotgun a classic example of that? And -- and give me a contrast. And by contrast, what that fell under the ACCA residual clause would not fall under 16(b) because the same thing could not be said. No. Give me one that would fall under the ACCA residual clause, but -- but -- or where there was confusion as to whether it fell under the residual clause. So, Mr. Kneedler, it's absolutely right that the court in Johnson said that those examples compounded the problem. But the essential problem that the court thought existed was the use of the ordinary case analysis. So I'm just going to ask you the question that the court asked in Johnson, and I'd -- I -- how do we answer this question? This is what the court said in Johnson: ""How does one go about deciding what kind of conduct the ordinary case of a crime involves? A statistical analysis of the State reporter? A survey? Expert evidence? Google? Gut instinct? So that's a multiple-choice test. What do we do? Because that is still the same under this statute. So can I give you another example just to test how this test works? You say you look to the elements of the -- the offense to see if they give rise to a risk of injury. Do I have that right? Okay. How do we do vehicular flight under that example? I'm just trying to sort of ground this. And you might be right. I'm not -- you know, I'm just trying to figure out what the difference is if we look at it that way, because that doesn't sound so different from what we were trying to do in ACCA. In fact, it sounds kind of the same as, honestly. So give me vehicular flight. How does it work? So that would fall on -- on the included side? Because I -- I had thought that your brief said something different, but maybe I misread it. And go back to possession of a shotgun, because I'm running over in my mind my memory of the Johnson oral argument where basically the SG's office made exactly this argument about possession of a shotgun, how the elements of that offense are understood to give rise to a significant level of risk. Presumably, the person is possessing the shotgun when the person kills somebody, so it's -- temporally, I don't think that that argument works. Could -- could I ask, just in thinking through your argument, it would help me to get a few examples. So could you give me three examples, let's say, if there are in -- if there are those -- that many, where we struggled under ACCA, but where the answer is clear under 16(b), so that I understand what it -- what kind of distinction you're drawing. Anything else? Because this is really important for me. I'm trying to figure out what our differences are. There was something that -- that isn't here, Mr. Rosenkranz, and that is a long history of struggling and failing to come up with an interpretation. And I'm wondering why you think we don't have that same history. Because I don't think that there's any question that we would not have said what we said in Johnson had Johnson been the first case. Johnson was the umpteenth case, and we had gone back and forth and we had struggled and we couldn't figure out, and -- and here we don't seem to have any of that. It seems as though -- and not only with respect to this Court, but with respect to lower courts -- it seems that everybody is getting along just fine. And much as I can't quite understand what the difference is, there just does seem to be a difference in practice. Mr. Rosenkranz, I guess I would have thought that your answer would have been different. I guess I would have thought that your answer would have been whatever implications Johnson had for Vagueness Doctrine, it has already had, and that all you are asking us to do is just essentially to say that this statute is no different from the statute that we looked at in Johnson and to write an opinion that basically just repeats Johnson. And whatever implications it's had or it will have, it will have regardless, and this opinion would do nothing more. He says burglary is that. If I understood what he was saying, and I won't try to put words in his mouth, but it was something along the lines that, yes, it's true that the elements of burglary do not have the use of force. But if we look back to the historic understanding of burglary, what we find is a longstanding concern with exactly that subject. In other words, that burglary wouldn't have been defined as it was, wouldn't have been prosecuted as it was, except for this fear of the use of force. I don't know. And that's the best I can do with it and he will tell me if he can do better. Well, what's coming here? The -- you said that the lower courts are all confused, and there are splits developing. What? ",well may i ask mr kneedler because this aspect of your brief be confuse to me because sometimes you be talk about temporal and sometimes you be talk about functional and i want to know what you think the real limitation be so take the example that you use which be the possession of a shotgun example right and you say that that would fall outside of section and the question be why temporally you know you be possess a shotgun when you shoot somebody you can not do it any other way so the temporal analysis do not work so what be it about that example that make it fall outside of section whereas you argue it would have fall inside of acca yes exactly so why be you so sure that there would not be the confusion under section well that be absolutely true and that be what give us trouble in acca because it could culminate in its use but it do not have to culminate in its use but then you take a case like burglary and you could say the exact same thing about burglary somebody could walk in on a burglary and all of a sudden there would be a use of force but a burglary could happen in such a way that nobody walk in and there would not be a use of force so again it just seem as though we be replicate the same kind of confusion and there be nothing that separate the two or at least I be try to find out what you think separate the two you know i i be very struck by that language too and i think it be that language more than some of the other language you point to in its brief that might suggest that there be some distinction between b and and the acca residual clause but on the other hand by its nature seem to suggest an element focus a real element focus look at the element and ask give those element give the nature of the offense what be go to happen but you know the element section of section be section a so it can not be all about all element so what be that by its nature do but why be not also possession of a shotgun a classic example of that and and give me a contrast and by contrast what that fell under the acca residual clause would not fall under b because the same thing could not be say no give me one that would fall under the acca residual clause but but or where there be confusion as to whether it fell under the residual clause so mr kneedler it be absolutely right that the court in johnson say that those example compound the problem but the essential problem that the court think exist be the use of the ordinary case analysis so I be just go to ask you the question that the court ask in johnson and I would i how do we answer this question this be what the court say in johnson how do one go about decide what kind of conduct the ordinary case of a crime involve a statistical analysis of the state reporter a survey expert evidence google gut instinct so that be a multiple choice test what do we do because that be still the same under this statute so can i give you another example just to test how this test work you say you look to the element of the the offense to see if they give rise to a risk of injury do i have that right okay how do we do vehicular flight under that example I be just try to sort of ground this and you might be right I be not you know I be just try to figure out what the difference be if we look at it that way because that do not sound so different from what we we be try to do in acca in fact it sound kind of the same as honestly so give me vehicular flight how do it work so that would fall on on the included side because i i have think that your brief say something different but maybe i misread it and go back to possession of a shotgun because I be run over in my mind my memory of the johnson oral argument where basically the sg s office make exactly this argument about

in if there be those that many where we struggle under acca but where the answer be clear under b so that i understand what it what kind of distinction you be draw anything else because this be really important for me I be try to figure out what our difference be there be something that that be not here mr rosenkranz and that be a long history of struggle and fail to come up with an interpretation and I be wonder why you think we do not have that same history because i do not think that there be any question that we would not have say what we say in johnson have johnson be the first case johnson be the umpteenth case and we have go back and forth and we have struggle and we could not figure out and and here we do not seem to have any of that it seem as though and not only with respect to this court but with respect to low court it seem that everybody be get along just fine and much as i can not quite understand what the difference be there just do seem to be a difference in practice mr rosenkranz i guess i would have think that your answer would have be different i guess i would have think that your answer would have be whatever implication johnson have for vagueness

2017,Byrd v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"Wouldn't that apply to criminals too? Wouldn't that apply to criminals too? We've been very clear that criminals don't have Fourth Amendment rights. The property-based concepts that Justice Gorsuch was stating would say that criminals have that kind of property interest. Mr. Loeb, we've always said that there's a normative component to expectations of privacy. In other words, they're those expectations that society has prepared to recognize as reasonable. So here you have at the very least a person who's violated important contract terms, terms that are of some significance to the owner of the property, as well as a person who is engaged in conduct that frustrates law enforcement in various ways; get behind the wheel, you're not the person who's authorized to be here, the police don't know who you are. And, you know, this is -- the facts of this case provide a good example of how unauthorized driving can frustrate law enforcement. So why is it that society should be prepared to recognize this conduct as reasonable? Well, sometimes -- As -- But you've just told Justice Alito that that can't possibly be your test because there are all kinds of provisions in this contract and people violate some of them. And you would never say that that eliminates any right to privacy. So here you have a case where somebody is in possession and control of the car. That person has been given permission by the renter to be in possession and control of the car. It's true that there's a contract violation, but the contract violation, let's be frank, is not uncommon. Some courts have even said that these contract violations are foreseeable. And -- and it's understood by everybody as relating to insurance liability, not to privacy. So what eliminates the right of privacy that you would normally get by opening up the car of a door and sitting in the front seat and turning the ignition key? Well, Justice Alito's question is very much related to mine, because there are all kinds of contract terms where if you're -- if you're sitting behind the wheel of a car and you're -- you're driving on gravel, you're in violation of the contract. You know, there are tens of them. So why is this one any different? Why does this one eliminate what you would normally get by being in that car with the permission of the renter? Do you think anything depends on knowledge? So suppose that in this case Byrd had been told, don't worry, I have you down as an un -- as an authorized driver. Would that be different, if he thought he was an authorized driver? No, obviously he -- -- knew that he was an unauthorized driver, but I'm saying how about if he didn't? What if he was an -- what if he thought he was an authorized driver? And you're saying same rule? If I understand -- Well, suppose, Mr. Feigin, that in this case Reed had said to Byrd, you know, the car is parked outside the house. And she had said you can -- you can -- if you want to make a phone call in private, you can go out to the car. And that's what Byrd did. He went out to the car. He sat in the car.

2017,Chavez-Meza v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, isn't -- So is what you're saying, Mr. Coberly, essentially that the judge should say any lower sentence would not meet the seriousness of this crime? Well, that -- that's this crime. The judge is saying I've looked at this crime, and -- and I don't -- I can't imagine, given the seriousness of this crime, going below 114 months. I don't understand why that would be a close call. I mean, what else are you supposed to say other than -- I can understand why you want the judge not just to check a box. I can understand why you want the judge to say, I've looked at the seriousness of this crime; I think it going below 114 months would not be in keeping with the seriousness of this crime. What else do you want a judge to say? I guess I'm finding it a little bit hard, Mr. Rosenstein, to understand your understanding of the background rule, because my understanding of the background rule comes from Taylor, where it said: ""Where, as here, Congress has declared that a decision will be governed by consideration of particular factors, a district court must carefully consider those factors as applied to the particular case, and whatever its decision, and clearly articulate their effect in order to permit meaningful appellate review."" So we're in one of these ""where, as here"" situations where Congress has declared that a decision is going to be governed by consideration of particular factors. And -- and Taylor seems to say: Look, what we need for intelligent appellate review is for the district court to clearly articulate why he did what he did. Now it doesn't have to be lengthy. It can just be pointing to, you know, this was a serious crime, here's -- here's why, the end. But -- but there has to be something, says Taylor. No? Can I go back -- And your -- your understanding where -- the language that I read you in Taylor where it said that there is some necessity to state some amount of reasoning, what do you think that that applies to? Well, is Taylor just about the statute? In Taylor, is that all it's about? Because, certainly, Taylor seemed to suggest a broader rule. It said, you know, where, as here, Congress has directed a district court to consider particular factors, in order to have effective appellate review, we need some brief statement about why the court has come out the way it has based on those factors. There's a -- there's another statutory section, which is 3583(e), which directs courts to consider the 3553(a) factors, those -- these same factors that are involved in this case, when terminating periods of supervised release. Do you think a judge can terminate a period of -- of supervised release and send somebody back to prison without any statement of reasons? I'm sorry. Hypothetically what? Well, a basis. But the question is, do you think that the court has to state reasons to send somebody back to prison under 3583(e)? It doesn't say anything about explanation. So I'll give you the relevant things. It basically says you have to consider the 3553(a) factors. But then it does not say that you have to explain anything. So the question is whether there's a background rule that says -- -- of course, before you send somebody back to prison like that, you have to at least say something. That's the question. Well, that's true, but this case involves what the Petitioner calls a disproportionality; that at the first instance you got the low end of the range and at the second instance, you're no longer at the low end of the range. And so the question that Rita raises is, in a case like that, is something a little bit more required, so that the judge says, you know what, I don't want to be at the low end of the range in -- in -- given this new range, because of the seriousness of the offense. And the judge doesn't have to do that at length, as Rita said, maybe the judge doesn't even have to do it in writing, as long as the judge says something to give both the defendant and the appellate court some understanding of why the judge is doing what the judge is doing. Well, it raises a question, don't you think? Quite right. And that's why the -- the court can say I don't think -- I don't want to go with the lowest point in the new range, and -- and that's absolutely the prerogative of the -- the district court. But the question that the Petitioner raises is just whether the judge has to say, I've thought about this question and I don't want to be at the low end of the range anymore because of the seriousness of the defense -- of the offense or because of something else. It just seems a -- it's a minor requirement but one that seems as though it would help the appellate court quite a lot to know why the judge had chosen a sentence that was no longer at the low end of the range. But in stating a standard, you're essentially asking us to repeat those words that you just read from Rita, is that correct? But when you say minimally, you mean more than just check the box, right? ",well be not so be what you be say mr coberly essentially that the judge should say any low sentence would not meet the seriousness of this crime well that that be this crime the judge be say I have look at this crime and and i do not i can not imagine give the seriousness of this crime go below month i do not understand why that would be a close call i mean what else be you suppose to say other than i can understand why you want the judge not just to check a box i can understand why you want the judge to say I have look at the seriousness of this crime i think it go below month would not be in keep with the seriousness of this crime what else do you want a judge to say i guess I be find it a little bit hard mr rosenstein to understand your understanding of the background rule because my understanding of the background rule come from taylor where it say where as here congress have declare that a decision will be govern by consideration of particular factor a district court must carefully consider those factor as apply to the particular case and whatever its decision and clearly articulate their effect in order to permit meaningful appellate review so we be in one of these where as here situation where congress have declare that a decision be go to be govern by consideration of particular factor and and taylor seem to say look what we need for intelligent appellate review be for the district court to clearly articulate why he do what he do now it do not have to be lengthy it can just be point to you know this be a serious crime here s here s why the end but but there have to be something say taylor no can i go back and your your understanding where the language that i read you in taylor where it say that there be some necessity to state some amount of reasoning what do you think that that apply to well be taylor just about the statute in taylor be that all it be about because certainly taylor seem to suggest a broad rule it say you know where as here congress have direct a district court to consider particular factor in order to have effective appellate review we need some brief statement about why the court have come out the way it have base on those factor there be a there be another statutory section which be e which direct court to consider the a factor those these same factor that be involve in this case when terminate period of supervised release do you think a judge can terminate a period of of supervised release and send somebody back to prison without any statement of reason I be sorry hypothetically what well a basis but the question be do you think that the court have to state reason to send somebody back to prison under e it do not say anything about explanation so I will give you the relevant thing it basically say you have to consider the a factor but then it do not say that you have to explain anything so the question be whether there be a background rule that say of course before you send somebody back to prison like that you have to at least say something that be the question well that be true but this case involve what the petitioner call a disproportionality that at the first instance you get the low end of the range and at the second instance you be no longer at the low end of the range and so the question that rita raise be in a case like that be something a little bit more required so that the judge say you know what i do not want to be at the low end of the range in in give this new range because of the seriousness of the offense and the judge do not have to do that at length as rita say maybe the judge do not even have to do it in write as long as the judge say something to give both the defendant and the appellate court some understanding of why the judge be do what the judge be do well it raise a question do not you think quite right and that be why the the court can say i do not think i do not want to go with the low point in the new range and and that be absolutely the prerogative of the the district court but the question that the petitioner raise be just whether the judge have to say I have think about this question and i do not want to be at the low end of the range anymore because of the seriousness of the defense of the offense or because of something else it just seem a it be a minor requirement but one that seem as though it would help the appellate court quite a lot to know why the judge have choose a sentence that be no long at the low end of the range but in state a standard you be essentially ask us to repeat those word that you just read from rita be that correct but when you say minimally you mean more than just check the box right ,298.57,Roberts Court,"Apr 23, 2018",Adaucto Chavez-Mesa,United States of America,17-5639,"Jan 12, 2018","Jun 18, 2018",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2017,Currier v. Virginia,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Fisher -- First, you had a second point you wanted to make, and then I have a question. But I just wanted to hear your second point. Here -- here's my question: Suppose that in this case the court had made very clear to your client the consequences of agreeing to sever. In other words, suppose that there had been some kind of colloquy and the court had said: You know, if you agree to this, one of the things you're agreeing to is that there would -- you won't be able to get issue preclusive effect. Would that be perfectly fine? I mean, I guess the -- the reason I ask this is because it seems to me that maybe the problem in this case has to do with the fact that people just don't know what the background rule is, and that we could establish a background rule almost whichever way we establish the background rule and people would then be aware of the consequences going forward when they agree to sever. Well, Mr. -- I'm sorry. Well -- mean, it's one thing to say, as we've said many times, that when you say I want two trials, that what you've given up is the right to object about two trials. Right? That really is inconsistent. If you're insisting on multiple trials, or preferring multiple trials, then you can't assert your right against multiple trials. But that's not this case. Somebody can say I want two trials and still have it in his view that, in that second trial, normal issue preclusion principles will apply. So sometimes that will prevent the second trial, but sometimes it won't prevent the second trial because the government can prove its case another way. And so there's no inconsistency of the kind that exists in claim preclusion in this kind of case, is there? Well, I don't -- I don't understand what that means. The -- the Solicitor General says that as well in its brief, and I didn't understand that either, because surely the government doesn't mean that if the government couldn't prove their case another way, the government could try to do so. Right? I mean, if the government could prove their case another way, then the trial isn't barred. Right? The trial goes forward with the government proving its case another way. Well, whatever you call it, the point still stands that the defendant is in a position where it's perfectly consistent to say two things: Yes, I would like two trials, and in that second trial, I expect that issue preclusion principles will apply. That's very different from the kind of inconsistency that we've pointed out in the past, where the government can't -- the person can't say on the one hand I want two trials and say on the other hand I don't want two trials. Well -- Well, Ms. Ross, why not make sure that it actually is the defendant's choice? I mean, if it were, that would be one thing. So why isn't the best rule a rule that says we're going to insist that some kind of colloquy takes place where the judge says to the defendant, you know, if -- if you want these two trials, here's the result of that; you lose the ability to argue issue preclusion? Why isn't that the best way to think about this kind of problem? But your argument is all about voluntary choices on the part of the defendant, and you're essentially arguing a kind of waiver by conduct. And what I'm suggesting is if this is -- you know, if this -- if the way to think about this case is what is the defendant giving up when he agrees to a severance, then the obvious answer is: Tell the defendant what the consequences are, and ask him whether he's willing to suffer them. Well, but maybe the defendant understands that we in our Double Jeopardy Clause have -- have emphasized pretty strongly the value of acquittals, and that acquittals mean something in our system, and they preclude the government from doing certain things that are inconsistent with those acquittals. So I guess -- I guess I don't -- don't understand why, in the absence of a colloquy, and given the backdrop of double jeopardy law that focuses so much on not doing anything that's inconsistent with acquittals, the defendant would, of course, know that he was giving up his right to issue preclusion? Well, but -- -- then you're saying, when you say the Double Jeopardy Clause protects multiple trials for the same offense, that's one thing that the Double Jeopardy Clause protects. And another thing that the Double Jeopardy Clause protects -- and this is the difference between the claim preclusion aspect of it and the issue preclusion aspect of it -- is the preservation of acquittals. And that's what is involved in this case. ",mr fisher first you have a second point you want to make and then i have a question but i just want to hear your second point here here s my question suppose that in this case the court have make very clear to your client the consequence of agree to sever in other word suppose that there have be some kind of colloquy and the court have say you know if you agree to this one of the thing you be agree to be that there would you will not be able to get issue preclusive effect would that be perfectly fine i mean i guess the the reason i ask this be because it seem to me that maybe the problem in this case have to do with the fact that people just do not know what the background rule be and that we could establish a background rule almost whichever way we establish the background rule and people would then be aware of the consequence go forward when they agree to sever well mr I be sorry well mean it be one thing to say as we have say many time that when you say i want two trial that what you have give up be the right to object about two trial right that really be inconsistent if you be insist on multiple trial or prefer multiple trial then you can not assert your right against multiple trial but that be not this case somebody can say i want two trial and still have it in his view that in that second trial normal issue preclusion principle will apply so sometimes that will prevent the second trial but sometimes it will not prevent the second trial because the government can prove its case another way and so there be no inconsistency of the kind that exist in claim preclusion in this kind of case be there well i do not i do not understand what that mean the the solicitor general say that as well in its brief and i do not understand that either because surely the government do not mean that if the government could not prove their case another way the government could try to do so right i mean if the government could prove their case another way then the trial be not bar right the trial go forward with the government prove its case another way well whatever you call it the point still stand that the defendant be in a position where it be perfectly consistent to say two thing yes i would like two trial and in that second trial i expect that issue preclusion principle will apply that be very different from the kind of inconsistency that we have point out in the past where the government can not the person can not say on the one hand i want two trial and say on the other hand i do not want two trial well well ms ross why not make sure that it actually be the defendant s choice i mean if it we be that would be one thing so why be not the best rule a rule that say we be go to insist that some kind of colloquy take place where the judge say to the defendant you know if if you want these two trial here s the result of that you lose the ability to argue issue preclusion why be not that the best way to think about this kind of problem but your argument be all about voluntary choice on the part of the defendant and you be essentially argue a kind of waiver by conduct and what I be suggest be if this be you know if this if the way to think about this case be what be the defendant give up when he agree to a severance then the obvious answer be tell the defendant what the consequence be and ask him whether he be willing to suffer them well but maybe the defendant understand that we in our double jeopardy clause have have emphasize pretty strongly the value of acquittal and that acquittal mean something in our system and they preclude the government from do certain thing that be inconsistent with those acquittal so i guess i guess i do not do not understand why in the absence of a colloquy and give the backdrop of double jeopardy law that focus so much on not do anything that be inconsistent with acquittal the defendant would of course know that he be give up his right to issue preclusion well but then you be say when you say the double jeopardy clause protect multiple trial for the same offense that be one thing that the double jeopardy clause protects and another thing that the double jeopardy clause protects and this be the difference between the claim preclusion aspect of it and the issue preclusion aspect of it be the preservation of acquittal and that be what be involve in this case ,272.2,Roberts Court,"Feb 20, 2018",Michael N.

2017,Husted v. A. Philip Randolph Institute,114,Elena Kagan,"But, General, if I can take you back to Justice Ginsburg's question because it seems as though you are effectively turning 8(d)(1) into a kind of safe harbor in this sense: 8(d)(1) says that these confirmation procedures are a permissible part of the program, even though part of the confirmation procedures are about not voting. So that's clear that 8(d)(1) says that. But you are trying to take that and convert it into something bigger and broader, essentially saying if you use these confirmation procedures, your entire program is going to be insulated from criticism, even though there's another part of your program that explicitly relies on non-voting. And I don't see that as in any way being the point of 8(d)(1). You're trying to take 8(d)(1), which says, sure, you can have a part of the program that does this, and turn it into a much bigger and broader safe harbor for everything that you do. I -- I must say I don't understand the -- I think this is a little bit of a different question, but since you've raised it, the proximate cause argument, I don't understand, because essentially what the Ohio program does is it says non-voting, failure to respond, non-voting. And you're trying to pick out the middle piece of that and say that's the only proximate cause. That's just not the way we think of proximate cause in any area. No -- no argument on that. Sure, there's a proximate cause test, but there's more -- you know, there's more -- there can be more than one proximate cause in the world. Well, isn't that just adding a word into the statute that Congress wrote? The statute -- Congress said by reason to vote. There are multiple places in the U.S. Code where Congress wants to say sole -- you know, solely by reason, and Congress says it. It means something different because there are lots of situations in which two components together cause something. And so to add that word ""solely"" is to change the meaning of the statute. And that word is not in this provision. Which -- which two? The -- The HAVA and the NFRA -- NVRA provision? Okay. General, everybody is looking here for a way to reconcile these two provisions. I mean, you're right, these two provisions are like, okay, what do we do with these? But why isn't the obvious way to reconcile the two provisions just to say, look, you got this failure-to-vote clause, but don't think that this failure-to-vote clause bars a state from using the confirmation procedures. It doesn't bar a state from using the confirmation procedures. That can be a permissible part of the state program. So that's your way to reconcile the two things. Taken on its own, the failure-to-vote clause looks as though it might bar confirmation procedures. The confirmation procedure says, no, not these. But the solely clause in HAVA -- -- is a completely independent provision in a completely independent statute. I mean, it's not the clarifying amendment, which we can talk about, and the solely clause is -- it's a part of a -- a different provision in a different statute dealing with a related but different subject matter. So there would be no reason to take one provision that says solely, and says because that provision says solely, we're going to treat this provision as also saying solely when this provision does not say solely. In fact, we have a rule against that in statutory interpretation. Usually, we say, look, Congress knows how to do a solely provision. It didn't do it here. Well, that's exactly what the clarifying amendment says. You're exactly right. It says don't -- don't interpret the failure-to-vote clause as preventing use of the confirmation procedures. And that's my point about how these two things are reconcilable. The clarifying amendment says how they're reconcilable. Don't -- don't interpret the failure-to-vote clause as barring the confirmation procedures. States can use the confirmation procedures, but that doesn't mean that they can do anything else that they want to on top of the confirmation procedures. General, it would be right, isn't it -- I think you acknowledge this -- that if your position is correct, that the failure to vote clause simply doesn't apply to removal programs for change of residence. Is that correct? Because, of course, all those programs have to use the confirmation procedures, and your position -- -- is that if you use the confirmation procedures, that's a -- basically, that's an out for everything? Not much broader application, because how could you possibly use failure to vote to -- for, you know, mental incapacity or criminal convictions. What broader application does it have? Right. But I guess what I'm asking, General, is sort of two related questions. Number 1, if the effect of your position is to say, look, we don't mean for this failure-to-vote clause to apply to programs about change of residence, why didn't Congress just say that? That's Number 1. And, Number 2, I mean, I -- I can see the point that it's not -- it doesn't make the failure-to-vote clause completely meaningless, but I'm still looking for the place where it has some real impact on anybody's -- -- voting programs. But with respect, General, I don't think you answered either of the two questions that I asked you, so I'll try again. Why wouldn't they just have said the failure-to-vote clause doesn't apply to -- to -- to -- to where a state uses the confirmation procedures? Okay. So the second question is what is left of the failure-to-vote clause, practically speaking? Well, what other ground are we talking about? I mean, it's not -- nobody used it as a presumption for mental incapacity. I don't understand why it's just -- it's proximate cause, but both -- strike one, strike two, strike three. They're all proximate causes of the strikeout. ",but general if i can take you back to justice ginsburg s question because it seem as though you be effectively turn d into a kind of safe harbor in this sense d say that these confirmation procedure be a permissible part of the program even though part of the confirmation procedure be about not vote so that be clear that d say that but you be try to take that and convert it into something big and broad essentially say if you use these confirmation procedure your entire program be go to be insulate from criticism even though there be another part of your program that explicitly rely on non voting and i do not see that as in any way be the point of d you be try to take d which say sure you can have a part of the program that do this and turn it into a much big and broad safe harbor for everything that you do i i must say i do not understand the i think this be a little bit of a different question but since you have raise it the proximate because argument i do not understand because essentially what the ohio program do be it say non voting failure to respond non voting and you be try to pick out the middle piece of that and say that be the only proximate because that be just not the way we think of proximate because in any area no no argument on that sure there be a proximate because test but there be more you know there be more there can be more than one proximate because in the world well be not that just add a word into the statute that congress write the statute congress say by reason to vote there be multiple place in the us code where congress want to say sole you know solely by reason and congress say it it mean something different because there be lot of situation in which two component together because something and so to add that word solely be to change the meaning of the statute and that word be not in this provision which which two the the hava and the nfra nvra provision okay general everybody be look here for a way to reconcile these two provision i mean you be right these two provision be like okay what do we do with these but why be not the obvious way to reconcile the two provision just to say look you get this failure to vote clause but do not think that this failure to vote clause bar a state from use the confirmation procedure it do not bar a state from use the confirmation procedure that can be a permissible part of the state program so that be your way to reconcile the two thing take on its own the failure to vote clause look as though it might bar confirmation procedure the confirmation procedure say no not these but the solely clause in hava be a completely independent provision in a completely independent statute i mean it be not the clarifying amendment which we can talk about and the solely clause be it be a part of a a different provision in a different statute deal with a related but different subject matter so there would be no reason to take one provision that say solely and say because that provision say solely we be go to treat this provision as also say solely when this provision do not say solely in fact we have a rule against that in statutory interpretation usually we say look congress know how to do a solely provision it do not do it here well that be exactly what the clarify amendment say you be exactly right it say do not do not interpret the failure to vote clause as prevent use of the confirmation procedure and that be my point about how these two thing be reconcilable the clarify amendment say how they be reconcilable do not do not interpret the failure to vote clause as bar the confirmation procedure state can use the confirmation procedure but that do not mean that they can do anything else that they want to on top of the confirmation procedure general it would be right be not it i think you acknowledge this that if your position be correct that the failure to vote clause simply do not apply to removal program for change of residence be that correct because of course all those program have to use the confirmation procedure and your position be that if you use the confirmation procedure that be a basically that be an out for everything not much broad application because how could you possibly use failure to vote to for you know mental incapacity or criminal conviction what broad application do it have right but i guess what I be ask general be sort of two related question number if the effect of your position be to say look we do not mean for this failure to vote clause to apply to program about change of residence why do not congress just say that that be number and number i mean i i can see the point that it be not it do not make the failure to vote clause completely meaningless but I be still look for the place where it have some real impact on anybody s vote program but with respect general i do not think you answer either of the two question that i ask you so I will try again why would not they just have say the failure to vote clause do not apply to to to to where a state use the confirmation procedure okay so the second question be what be leave of the failure to vote clause practically speak well what other ground be we talk about i mean it be not nobody use it as a presumption for mental incapacity i do not understand why it be just it be proximate because but both strike one strike two strike three they be all proximate cause of the strikeout ,350.04,Roberts Court,"Jan 10, 2018",Jon Husted,A.

2017,SAS Institute Inc. v. Iancu,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Castanias, can I ask how your statutory argument works, given your position on canceled claims? If I understand your position on canceled claims, it's that the Board need not render a decision as to those claims. Is that right? So I guess what's the difference between a canceled claim and a non-instituted claim? In other words, both were originally in the petition. Both are no longer in dispute. So, with respect to the one, you say it's perfectly consistent with the statutory language that the Board did not render a decision. Then why not with respect to the other as well? So I understand there's a practical difference, but I was looking for -- because you say that your view is commanded by the statute and particularly, I think, by this phrase ""challenged by the petitioner."" But if you were right about the statutory language, that would apply to canceled claims as well? It was challenged by the Petitioner in the original petition. And this one is also no longer in dispute. And I think what the Board would say is that the same thing is true here, there's nothing to adjudicate because they've said that it doesn't pass the threshold, so they're not in the business of adjudicating it. Well, what language in the statute distinguishes between the canceled claim and the non-instituted claim? Well, one of the stories that the statute as written seems to tell is of great discretion to the Board with respect to the institution decision. It says you never have to institute; it's your choice whether to institute; you can't get review of the institution decision, which is our Cuozzo case; you get to write your own rules about the institution decision, which is the -- the rule-making delegation. So it's a little bit odd to say, well, here's the one thing you don't have discretion over when it comes to institution: you can't say these claims but not those claims. In a -- in a context in which Congress said the institution decision is really for the Board, it's a discretionary decision that lies in its bailiwick, why should we carve out that one thing? Or couldn't the agency at that point say, you know, the ground on which you charge this patent is invalid is not a ground we can review at this time? And then it would seem, I mean, that would be a strange kind of thing to say, well, you can't challenge on that ground, but we're going to issue a decision as to patentability. Mr. Castanias, while we're on the statute, I understand that this is your argument for why there has to be a final decision with respect to every claim challenged, by, you know, however you -- but you're still saying that -- that you're not challenging the -- the partial institution. Is that right? And I guess here's my question -- -- is what language says that partial institution is not permissible? I think I'm not understanding. Could you just point me to the -- the language that you're saying. That's -- -- the thing that you can't -- ",mr castanias can i ask how your statutory argument work give your position on cancel claim if i understand your position on canceled claim it be that the board need not render a decision as to those claim be that right so i guess what be the difference between a canceled claim and a non instituted claim in other word both we be originally in the petition both be no longer in dispute so with respect to the one you say it be perfectly consistent with the statutory language that the board do not render a decision then why not with respect to the other as well so i understand there be a practical difference but i be look for because you say that your view be command by the statute and particularly i think by this phrase challenge by the petitioner but if you we be right about the statutory language that would apply to cancel claim as well it be challenge by the petitioner in the original petition and this one be also no longer in dispute and i think what the board would say be that the same thing be true here there be nothing to adjudicate because they have say that it do not pass the threshold so they be not in the business of adjudicate it well what language in the statute distinguishes between the cancel claim and the non institute claim well one of the story that the statute as write seem to tell be of great discretion to the board with respect to the institution decision it say you never have to institute it be your choice whether to institute you can not get review of the institution decision which be our cuozzo case you get to write your own rule about the institution decision which be the the rule make delegation so it be a little bit odd to say well here s the one thing you do not have discretion over when it come to institution you can not say these claim but not those claim in a in a context in which congress say the institution decision be really for the board it be a discretionary decision that lie in its bailiwick why should we carve out that one thing or could not the agency at that point say you know the ground on which you charge this patent be invalid be not a ground we can review at this time and then it would seem i mean that would be a strange kind of thing to say well you can not challenge on that ground but we be go to issue a decision as to patentability mr castanias while we be on the statute i understand that this be your argument for why there have to be a final decision with respect to every claim challenge by you know however you but you be still say that that you be not challenge the the partial institution be that right and i guess here s my question be what language say that partial institution be not permissible i think I be not understanding could you just point me to the the language that you be say that be the thing that you can not ,178.28,Roberts Court,"Nov 27, 2017",SAS Institute Inc.,"Joseph MatalAndrei Iancu, Director, United States Patent and Trademark Office, et al.",16-969,"May 22, 2017","Apr 24, 2018",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2017,Carpenter v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"It would help me -- Mr. Wessler, can I ask you about your understanding of the state of the technology now? Because the government represents in -- in its briefs, and it has those pictures in its briefs, suggesting that you -- you -- that the information that's gleaned from this is -- is very -- it's sort of general, it's vague, it doesn't pinpoint exactly where you are, and in order to make effective use of it, it has to be combined with many other pieces of information. And, you know -- you know, A, do you agree with that, but, B, what is your view of -- of the relevance of the fact that information may not be useful in itself but may be useful in combination with other information? Does that make a difference? Mr. Dreeben, how is this different from Jones? You know, in Jones, there were a couple of different opinions, but five justices, as -- as I count it, said this -- this is from Justice Alito's opinion: ""Society's expectation has been that law enforcement and others would not, and indeed in the main simply cannot, monitor and catalogue every single movement of an individual's"" -- there it was a car -- ""for a long period."" So how is it different from that? So the question is why that should make more of a difference than the obvious similarity between this case and Jones? And the obvious similarity is that, in both cases, you have reliance on a new technology that allows for 24/7 tracking. Now, you're exactly right, there were different means, but in both cases, you have a new technology that allows for 24/7 tracking and a conclusion by a number of justices in Jones that that was an altogether new and different thing that did intrude on people's expectations of who would be watching them when. Mr. -- Mr. Dreeben, can I -- Right. But, Mr. Dreeben, that could go away tomorrow. The question here is the constitutional question, not the statutory one. So can I take you back to what, it seems to me, is the essential identity between the factual circumstances here and in Jones, which is that the government is getting 24/7 information. I mean, in some ways, you could say this is more. Jones was just about a car; this is about every place that you are, whether you're in a car or not. And you said to me that what makes it different is that you've given the information to another person. But I recall that when you were here in the Jones case, your theory for why that was permissible was essentially that you had given that information to the entire public; in other words, just by being in the world, everybody sees you, everybody watches you, and you've lost your expectation of privacy in that way. Now, we pretty conclusively rejected that argument. Why is it different when it's giving it to one person, the same information, this 24/7 tracking, than we said it was when you give it to the entire world? But let's assume you could. Let's assume Mr. Wessler is right that the -- the technology keeps on getting better and better, more and more precise, it's not 10 football fields anymore; it's half of this courtroom. Next month, it may be an eighth of this courtroom. You know, so let's assume that we're looking ahead just a little bit and it's pretty precision-targeting. Would it be permissible for the government to ask a cell phone company for lifetime information? No, under your view of the Constitution. Where is the line? But -- but, Mr. Dreeben, that line of cases was developed in a period in which third parties did not have this kind of information, valid -- Yeah, but if -- -- I understand what you're saying, you're basically saying, well, because the government is going to a third-party here and doing it by subpoena, it doesn't matter how sensitive the information is. It doesn't matter whether there's really a lack of voluntariness on the individual's part in terms of conveying that information to the third-party. And we could go on and we could give, you know, other factors that you might think in a sensible world would matter to this question. And you're saying that all of that is trumped by the fact that the government is doing this by subpoena, rather than by setting up its own cell towers. ",it would help me mr wessler can i ask you about your understanding of the state of the technology now because the government represent in in its brief and it have those picture in its brief suggest that you you that the information that be glean from this be be very it be sort of general it be vague it do not pinpoint exactly where you be and in order to make effective use of it it have to be combine with many other piece of information and you know you know a do you agree with that but b what be your view of of the relevance of the fact that information may not be useful in itself but may be useful in combination with other information do that make a difference mr dreeben how be this different from jones you know in jones there we be a couple of different opinion but five justice as as i count it say this this be from justice alito s opinion society s expectation have be that law enforcement and others would not and indeed in the main simply can not monitor and catalogue every single movement of an individual s there it be a car for a long period so how be it different from that so the question be why that should make more of a difference than the obvious similarity between this case and jones and the obvious similarity be that in both case you have reliance on a new technology that allow for tracking now you be exactly right there we be different mean but in both case you have a new technology that allow for tracking and a conclusion by a number of justice in jones that that be an altogether new and different thing that do intrude on people s expectation of who would be watch them when mr mr dreeben can i right but mr dreeben that could go away tomorrow the question here be the constitutional question not the statutory one so can i take you back to what it seem to me be the essential identity between the factual circumstance here and in jones which be that the government be get information i mean in some way you could say this be more jones be just about a car this be about every place that you be whether you be in a car or not and you say to me that what make it different be that you have give the information to another person but i recall that when you we be here in the jones case your theory for why that be permissible be essentially that you have give that information to the entire public in other word just by be in the world everybody see you everybody watch you and you have lose your expectation of privacy in that way now we pretty conclusively reject that argument why be it different when it be give it to one person the same information this tracking than we say it be when you give it to the entire world but let us assume you could let us assume mr wessler be right that the the technology keep on get good and good more and more precise it be not football field anymore it be half of this courtroom next month it may be an eighth of this courtroom you know so let us assume that we be look ahead just a little bit and it be pretty precision target would it be permissible for the government to ask a cell phone company for lifetime information no under your view of the constitution where be the line but but mr dreeben that line of case be develop in a period in which third party do not have this kind of information valid yeah but if i understand what you be say you be basically say well because the government be go to a third party here and do it by subpoena it do not matter how sensitive the information be it do not matter whether there be really a lack of voluntariness on the individual s part in term of convey that information to the third party and we could go on and we could give you know other factor that you might think in a sensible world would matter to this question and you be say that all of that be trump by the fact that the government be do this by subpoena rather than by set up its own cell tower ,256.9200000000001,Roberts Court,"Nov 29, 2017",Timothy Ivory Carpenter,United States of America,16-402,"Jun 5, 2017","Jun 22, 2018",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2017,Rosales-Mireles v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"Why are guideline error -- And -- and why is that? Why are guideline errors a category in which we should kind of flip what usually happens; it goes from sparingly to most of the time? That seems more a prong 3 question, isn't it? The question -- you know, that -- that most guideline calculation errors are going to have an effect on the -- on -- on -- on the sentence, but then there's also prong 4. Why shouldn't that do something different? Mr. Ellis, can -- can I just -- Justice Gorsuch, when he was a judge, wrote this opinion which I'm sure you've read many times, and I just want to quote one sentence from it and then ask you what you think about it because he basically, you know, suggests why you maybe lose. (Laughter.) But this is what he says. He might not agree with this anymore, who knows, but -- (Laughter.) -- he says, ""What reasonable citizen wouldn't bear a rightly diminished view of the judicial process and its integrity if courts refuse to correct obvious errors of their own devise that threaten to require individuals to linger longer in federal prison than the law demands, especially when the cost of correction is so small?"" And I take that to be combining three things. First, you have a deprivation of liberty. Second, you have a -- an error, as he says, of your own devise; in other words, the court has something to do with it. The -- the probation officer has messed up, and then the court hasn't caught the error. And -- and, third, that the cost of correction is small, certainly relatively smaller. And you package those three things together and you get a -- you know, a rule that treats these kinds of errors differently, that does mean that they're routinely, as opposed to sparingly, corrected. Why isn't that right? Well, I think what they're -- I -- I mean, he could probably do it better than I can. I think what this is saying is, yes, the reasonable citizen, assuming this great reasonable citizen exists, you know, would think all of those things, but he would say here's this particular kind of error, and -- and it's rare that all of these three things come together. Deprivation of liberties, that's pretty common. But low costs, that's not so common. And the fact that the error is of the court's own making, that's really uncommon. And you put all those three things together, there's just one result that's screaming out at you. Well, pretty -- pretty low, you know, just over the bottom. But I think it -- it seems to me all these, 1, 2, and 3, run smack into Molina-Martinez, which, you know, basically rejected all of these arguments and said it doesn't matter if your sentence ends up in the middle because the -- the range does something. It anchors people's sentencing determinations, and it anchors them sufficiently so that even if you could have reached that sentence regardless of the range being wrong, we think the error in the range matters and is likely to matter in the great majority of cases. And you're suggesting that we ignore everything we said about that now. Well, but there again Molina-Martinez is against you, right, because, in that case, we talked about the fact that a remand for resentencing -- I'm quoting now -- ""while not costless, does not involve the same difficulties as a remand for retrial."" And we talked about the government had this concern over judicial resources, and we specifically rejected that. And we said, you know, that the resources are not sufficient for us to take that seriously here. ",why be guideline error and and why be that why be guideline error a category in which we should kind of flip what usually happen it go from sparingly to most of the time that seem more a prong question be not it the question you know that that most guideline calculation error be go to have an effect on the on on on the sentence but then there be also prong why should not that do something different mr elli can can i just justice gorsuch when he be a judge write this opinion which I be sure you have read many time and i just want to quote one sentence from it and then ask you what you think about it because he basically you know suggest why you maybe lose laughter but this be what he say he might not agree with this anymore who know but laughter he say what reasonable citizen would not bear a rightly diminish view of the judicial process and its integrity if court refuse to correct obvious error of their own devise that threaten to require individual to linger long in federal prison than the law demand especially when the cost of correction be so small and i take that to be combine three thing first you have a deprivation of liberty second you have a an error as he say of your own devise in other word the court have something to do with it the the probation officer have mess up and then the court have not catch the error and and third that the cost of correction be small certainly relatively small and you package those three thing together and you get a you know a rule that treat these kind of error differently that do mean that they be routinely as oppose to sparingly correct why be not that right well i think what they be i i mean he could probably do it good than i can i think what this be say be yes the reasonable citizen assume this great reasonable citizen exists you know would think all of those thing but he would say here s this particular kind of error and and it be rare that all of these three thing come together deprivation of liberty that be pretty common but low cost that be not so common and the fact that the error be of the court s own making that be really uncommon and you put all those three thing together there be just one result that be scream out at you well pretty pretty low you know just over the bottom but i think it it seem to me all these and run smack into molina martinez which you know basically reject all of these argument and say it do not matter if your sentence end up in the middle because the the range do something it anchor people s sentence determination and it anchor them sufficiently so that even if you could have reach that sentence regardless of the range be wrong we think the error in the range matter and be likely to matter in the great majority of case and you be suggest that we ignore everything we say about that now well but there again molina martinez be against you right because in that case we talk about the fact that a remand for resentencing I be quote now while not costless do not involve the same difficulty as a remand for retrial and we talk about the government have this concern over judicial resource and we specifically reject that and we say you know that the resource be not sufficient for us to take that seriously here ,228.92999999999995,Roberts Court,"Feb 21, 2018",Florencio Rosales-Mireles,United States of America,16-9493,"Sep 28, 2017","Jun 18, 2018",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2017,"Merit Management Group v. FTI Consulting, Inc.",114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Walsh? Could I take you back to Justice Alito's question, perhaps just put a little bit of a different spin on it? I mean, if you look at 546(e), it's clearly an exception to the avoidance power. It says ""notwithstanding"" all these sections which deal with avoidance, the trustee may not avoid the following transfers. So, I mean, it seems odd to read that in any other way than to start with the transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid. Why should we not do that? Why isn't that exactly what the text tell us -- tells us to do, where you start with the transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid and then you ask whether there's a safe harbor that applies to that transfer? I guess you're asking a court to make a shift in transfers in the middle of the analysis. In other words, first, the court has to say whether this is the kind of transfer that the trustee can avoid, and in doing that, the court is looking at the -- what you call the end-to-end transfer. And then all of a sudden, when it comes to the safe harbor, you're saying that the trustee has to flip and look at another transfer entirely. And that seems like a strange thing for a safe harbor to do. I mean, usually what we think is that, you know, a safe harbor would shield from avoidance a transfer that's being challenged, rather than a transfer that isn't being challenged. Do you think, though, Mr. Clement -- I'm sorry, if you want to -- Well, does that mean -- does that mean, Mr. Clement, that we -- all we do is we look at the trustee's complaint, we leave it to him to decide the question? So that -- that might be right. I was trying to think of cases in which there could be mischief by relying entirely on the trustee's power to define the transfer. And here is what I came up with, is that there truly is a transfer from a debtor to a bank, if the bank's not serving as an intermediary, it is a real transfer of stock, right? And now, 546 -- 546(e) is going to prevent the trustee from avoiding that. But then the trustee says: So, in order to get around 546(e), I'm going to define the transfer differently, I'm going to ask where the bank then transferred the stock and -- and -- and say that the transfer that I want to avoid is from the original debtor to whoever it was that the bank transferred the stock to, even though those really were two separate transactions. Could the trustee play games like that? What do you think is wrong, Mr. Clement, with the alternative approach? If I understand the alternative approach, which Justice Kennedy was referring to, it's more of a functional analysis; you ask who has dominion and control of a particular piece of property at a particular point. And -- and that seems more what the Seventh Circuit was doing than -- than what your brief suggests. So why do you think that that's a worse alternative than the one you're suggesting? May I ask, Mr. Clement, you might have no insight on this and you might not be able to say anything about it, so if so, just say so, but it is curious to me, I've never seen a bankruptcy case, maybe ever, but certainly a bankruptcy case like this one, in which we do not have a Solicitor General brief. Do you have any thoughts about why the SG didn't file here? ",mr walsh could i take you back to justice alito s question perhaps just put a little bit of a different spin on it i mean if you look at e it be clearly an exception to the avoidance power it say notwithstanding all these section which deal with avoidance the trustee may not avoid the following transfer so i mean it seem odd to read that in any other way than to start with the transfer that the trustee seek to avoid why should we not do that why be not that exactly what the text tell us tell us to do where you start with the transfer that the trustee seek to avoid and then you ask whether there be a safe harbor that apply to that transfer i guess you be ask a court to make a shift in transfer in the middle of the analysis in other word first the court have to say whether this be the kind of transfer that the trustee can avoid and in do that the court be look at the what you call the end to end transfer and then all of a sudden when it come to the safe harbor you be say that the trustee have to flip and look at another transfer entirely and that seem like a strange thing for a safe harbor to do i mean usually what we think be that you know a safe harbor would shield from avoidance a transfer that be be challenge rather than a transfer that be not be challenge do you think though mr clement I be sorry if you want to well do that mean do that mean mr clement that we all we do be we look at the trustee s complaint we leave it to him to decide the question so that that might be right i be try to think of case in which there could be mischief by rely entirely on the trustee s power to define the transfer and here be what i come up with be that there truly be a transfer from a debtor to a bank if the bank s not serve as an intermediary it be a real transfer of stock right and now e be go to prevent the trustee from avoid that but then the trustee say so in order to get around e I be go to define the transfer differently I be go to ask where the bank then transfer the stock and and and say that the transfer that i want to avoid be from the original debtor to whoever it be that the bank transfer the stock to even though those really we be two separate transaction could the trustee play game like that what do you think be wrong mr clement with the alternative approach if i understand the alternative approach which justice kennedy be refer to it be more of a functional analysis you ask who have dominion and control of a particular piece of property at a particular point and and that seem more what the seventh circuit be do than than what your brief suggests so why do you think that that be a worse alternative than the one you be suggest may i ask mr clement you might have no insight on this and you might not be able to say anything about it so if so just say so but it be curious to me I have never see a bankruptcy case maybe ever but certainly a bankruptcy case like this one in which we do not have a solicitor general brief do you have any thought about why the sg do not file here ,198.4,Roberts Court,"Nov 6, 2017",Merit Management Group,"FTI Consulting, Inc.",16-784,"May 1, 2017","Feb 27, 2018",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2017,"Jesner v. Arab Bank, PLC",114,Elena Kagan,"I -- I am -- I take your point that that's not in this case. But if it were in this case, that what you just said does raise Mr. Clement's argument that there are many better ways, perhaps, dealing with, you know, financial regulation generally, than allowing private suits to deal with those sorts of issues. If I could understand what you're saying, you're saying that a norm is just a standard of conduct and doesn't have anything to with the enforcement of that standard? Is that the basic point? So in what -- If I could go back to the Chief Justice's question, so in what kind of case involving a corporate defendant would another country hold us accountable if we didn't provide a remedy? So what you're saying is that in those sorts of classic cases, why would the foreign government care that the perpetrator was a corporation rather than an individual? Mr. Fletcher, can -- unless you're -- Just a different kind of question, which is you are here saying there shouldn't be an automatic bar against corporate liability. But I wonder if you have any view -- and if not, just say no -- as to what the scope of corporate liability might be. In other words, some folks have said, well, in this context, corporate liability might be only available for actions that were directed at high levels of the corporation as opposed to anything that any old employee of a corporation did. And I'm wondering whether you've thought through that question. But, really, but why would it have mattered? Suppose that there was a corporation that had a beef about the ambassador and sent one of its employees to go strike the ambassador and sent a judgment-proof employee to go strike the ambassador. (Laughter.) Why would France have cared? I don't agree. (Laughter.) But -- Well, I -- Mr. Clement, I think the reason I said I don't agree before is because, when you're talking about a standard of conduct under Sosa, it's clear that you have to find this universal body of law. But that's different from enforcement mechanisms. It's different -- you know, we have the ATS. Other countries have different things. Nobody requires an ATS-like provision. Nobody -- so, as to enforcement, I mean, where -- where do you get the understanding that that's a question where all countries have to agree to the same thing? As far as I understood your brief, you're only getting it from that Sosa Footnote 20, which really does not make that point at all. Look, I agree that there should be some understanding -- some notions of, you know, what do other countries do and is this likely to get us into trouble with other countries or not. I mean, that should come into play at some point when we're trying to figure out what kind of claims to accept. And I think even Mr. Fisher agrees with that. I don't think we have to ask about, you know, is it a uniform norm that every country accepts, but, rather, we have a set of rules under our domestic system which does hold corporations accountable. And if we use that as the typical enforcement mechanism, is that going to get us into trouble with other foreign countries? Is it going to create international friction? And it seems to me that that's the level at which all these international/foreign relations concerns come into play. Yes, I think that that's the question. But, see, that would suggest that all enforcement mechanisms have to be the same worldwide. And they just don't. Do you think that joint and several liability -- I mean, that's also an American concept, would that have to be accepted by every country in the world? But -- But let's talk about a -- but let's talk about a crime like that, Mr. Clement. You know, there's a lot in this lawsuit, which I think you have plenty of things to gripe about in this lawsuit. I guess the question is, do you have something to gripe about as to this particular point, which is corporate versus individual liability? And so just -- just assume a different lawsuit. So there is an American corporation. So the defendant is an American corporation, and it uses slave labor, and it uses slave labor of people in the United States, all the work is done in the United States, the activity is in the United States, of a particular nationality. And -- and the country from which these people come thinks that this is a pretty awful thing. And -- and you're saying that there shouldn't be ATS liability against the corporation in that circumstance even though they are using slave labor, clearly violating an international norm, even though in our domestic system, the manner of -- the method of enforcement we usually use is corporate liability, and even though this is a case in which the other country thinks who cares if it's a corporation. We want our people to be able to recover. They happen not to have very much money. It is the question. Well, the individuals also care if it's a felony. They would like a little bit of compensation. I guess one of the things that I'm suggesting, Mr. Clement, and this is reflected in your brief, you spend a lot of time essentially saying that this is one of those foreign cubed cases that we dealt with in Kiobel. And that might be right. But the question of corporate versus individual liability is a question that's entirely orthogonal to that, I mean, that you can come up with a very, very domestic-looking suit that raises the question of corporate versus individual liability and that that suit, when you focus on it, leads you to say, why on earth would you draw a distinction of this kind? ",i i be i take your point that that be not in this case but if it we be in this case that what you just say do raise mr clement s argument that there be many good way perhaps deal with you know financial regulation generally than allow private suit to deal with those sort of issue if i could understand what you be say you be say that a norm be just a standard of conduct and do not have anything to with the enforcement of that standard be that the basic point so in what if i could go back to the chief justice s question so in what kind of case involve a corporate defendant would another country hold us accountable if we do not provide a remedy so what you be say be that in those sort of classic case why would the foreign government care that the perpetrator be a corporation rather than an individual mr fletcher can unless you be just a different kind of question which be you be here say there should not be an automatic bar against corporate liability but i wonder if you have any view and if not just say no as to what the scope of corporate liability might be in other word some folk have say well in this context corporate liability might be only available for action that we be direct at high level of the corporation as oppose to anything that any old employee of a corporation do and I be wonder whether you have think through that question but really but why would it have matter suppose that there be a corporation that have a beef about the ambassador and send one of its employee to go strike the ambassador and send a judgment proof employee to go strike the

under sosa it be clear that you have to find this universal body of law but that be different from enforcement mechanism it be different you know we have the at other country have different thing nobody require an at like provision nobody so as to enforcement i mean where where do you get the understanding that that be a question where all country have to agree to the same thing as far as i understand your brief you be only get it from that sosa footnote which really do not make that point at all look i agree that there should be some understanding some notion of you know what do other

even mr fisher agree with that i do not think we have to ask about you know be it a uniform norm that every country accept but rather we have a set of rule under our domestic system which do hold

be the same worldwide and they just do not do you think that joint and several liability i mean that be also an american concept would that have to be accept by every country in the world but but let us talk about a but let us talk about a crime like that mr clement you know there be a lot in this lawsuit which i think you have plenty of thing to gripe about in this lawsuit i guess the question be do you have something to gripe about as to this particular point which be corporate versus individual liability and so just just assume a different lawsuit so there be an american corporation so the defendant be an american corporation and it use slave labor and it use slave labor of people in the united state all the work be do in the united state the activity be in the united state of a particular nationality and and the country from which these people come think that this be a pretty awful thing and and you be say that there should not be ats liability against the corporation in that circumstance even though they be use slave labor clearly violate an international norm even though in our domestic system the manner of the method of enforcement we usually use be corporate liability and even though this be a case in which the other country think who care if it be a corporation we want our people to be able to recover they happen not to have very much money it be the question well the individual also care if it be a felony they would like a little bit of compensation i guess one of the thing that I be suggest mr clement and this be reflect in your brief you spend a lot of time essentially say that this be one of those foreign cubed case that we deal with in kiobel and that might be right but the question of corporate versus individual liability be a question that be entirely orthogonal to that i mean that you can come up with a very very domestic look suit that raise the question of corporate versus individual liability and that that suit when you focus on it lead you to say why on earth would you draw a distinction of this kind ,337.52,Roberts Court,"Oct 11, 2017","Joseph Jesner, et al.","Arab Bank, PLC",16-499,"Apr 3, 2017","Apr 24,

2017,"South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc.",114,Elena Kagan,"But, General, usually, when somebody says something like that, that Congress has not addressed an issue for 25-plus years, you know, it -- it gives us reason to pause, because Congress could have addressed the issue and Congress chose not to. This is not the kind of issue where you say: Well, probably didn't get on Congress's radar screen or maybe Congress was too busy doing other things. This is a very prominent issue which Congress has been aware of for a very long time and has chosen not to do something about that. And that seems to make the -- your bar higher to surmount, isn't it? But isn't that essentially a reason why we should leave this to Congress? In other words, from this Court's perspective, the choice is just binary. It's -- it's you either have the Quill rule or you don't. But Congress is capable of crafting compromises and trying to figure out how to balance the wide range of interests involved here. Now the General said Congress hasn't done that, but, again, you know, Congress can decide when it wants to craft a compromise and when it doesn't want to craft a compromise. And then Congress, if it decides it wants to craft a compromise, can craft a compromise in ways that we cannot. I think what -- -- Justice Ginsburg was perhaps suggesting was that all these functions would be essentially taken over by companies like Amazon and eBay and Etsy, that they would do it for all the retailers on their system. Now there's something a little bit ironic in saying the problem with Quill is that it benefited all these companies, so now we're going to overturn Quill so that we can benefit the exact same companies. But -- but I think that that's the idea; that, in fact, this would not fall on individual entrepreneurs, that it -- instead, they would pay fees to companies like Amazon.

2017,United States v. Sanchez-Gomez,114,Elena Kagan,"But, Mr. -- Mr. Kedem, I think that the question that's being asked of you is there are a set of -- of claims, potentially, that would not have anything to do with the outcome of a trial or the outcome of a sentencing or even the outcome of a pretrial proceeding but would implicate a person's interest in liberty. And, you know, whether you want to do, you know, shackling or we've had claims that have to do with forced medication or excessive bail. All of these things arise in the context of a criminal proceeding but don't have anything to do with the outcomes of that proceeding, just have to do with independent liberty interests that are implicated in that proceeding. And what I think people are asking you is it seems harsh to say that there's really no way of presenting those claims. I take that point, but it seems as though Respondents have changed their minds a little bit. So, I mean -- -- I think that that's the interest that they're now asserting. All right. But that seems -- I mean, I don't know another case where we've said that the collateral-order doctrine rides on whether you have a way of bringing the same claim in an entirely separate proceeding. You know, here, something's happening to you in the criminal process, and you're saying, your brief said, oh, no worries, just go file a civil class action. But that seems like a requirement that we've never countenanced before. Can I -- can I just ask you to finish what you were saying? I didn't understand. You -- you have this hypothetical. And what would we do with a case like that? I know. But it just left me hanging. Because it seems to me that he should have a way -- -- of -- of getting that claim, you know, thought about. There -- there is something a little bit different with respect to this crime than most. I mean, this is an illegal entry crime, and I suspect you, in fact, see extremely high levels of recidivism for that crime because people often have their families here. So it's not uncommon that people continue to try to get into the country. Could -- could you speak to the government's view that this is kind of a new theory for you? But usually when we think about writs of mandamus, it's -- it's not that we give them when an issue is super important. It's that we give them when we think the outcome is super clear. And no one could say that about this case, could -- could they? But -- but that suggests if I look at somebody and he has a very, very, very long rap sheet, I'd say, well, you know, he clearly does this every month, he's just going to be here again, and give him a different rule from somebody who's a first offender. May -- may I ask something? It might -- it's probably not legally relevant. I'm just curious about it. At -- at -- at some point, why didn't one of the lawyers in your office pick up the phone -- there are a host of organizations that I can imagine bringing a suit like this one outside of any individual criminal case -- why didn't that call get made to one of those organizations? ",but mr mr kedem i think that the question that be be ask of you be there be a set of of claim potentially that would not have anything to do with the outcome of a trial or the outcome of a sentencing or even the outcome of a pretrial proceeding but would implicate a person s interest in liberty and you know whether you want to do you know shackle or we have have claim that have to do with forced medication or excessive bail all of these thing arise in the context of a criminal proceeding but do not have anything to do with the outcome of that proceeding just have to do with independent liberty interest that be implicate in that proceeding and what i think people be ask you be it seem harsh to say that there be really no way of present those claim i take that point but it seem as though respondent have change their mind a little bit so i mean i think that that be the interest that they be now assert all right but that seem i mean i do not know another case where we have say that the collateral order doctrine ride on whether you have a way of bring the same claim in an entirely separate proceeding you know here something s happen to you in the criminal process and you be say your brief say oh no worry just go file a civil class action but that seem like a requirement that we have never countenance before can i can i just ask you to finish what you we be say i do not understand you you have this hypothetical and what would we do with a case like that i know but it just leave me hang because it seem to me that he should have a way of of get that claim you know think about there there be something a little bit different with respect to this crime than most i mean this be an illegal entry crime and i suspect you in fact see extremely high level of recidivism for that crime because people often have their family here so it be not uncommon that people continue to try to get into the country could could you speak to the government s view that this be kind of a new theory for you but usually when we think about writ of mandamus it be it be not that we give them when an issue be super important it be that we give them when we think the outcome be super clear and no one could say that about this case could could they but but that suggest if i look at somebody and he have a very very very long rap sheet I would say well you know he clearly do this every month he be just go to be here again and give him a different rule from somebody who be a first offender may may i ask something it might it be probably not legally relevant I be just curious about it at at at some point why do not one of the lawyer in your office pick up the phone there be a host of organization that i can imagine bring a suit like this one outside of any individual criminal case why do not that call get make to one of those organization ,174.23999999999995,Roberts Court,"Mar 26, 2018",United States of America,"Rene Sanchez-Gomez, et al.",17-312,"Dec 8, 2017","May 14, 2018",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2017,Murphy v. Smith,114,Elena Kagan,"You think it goes without saying that the plaintiff would have to pay the full 20 percent? Because it doesn't say it. So I think -- Right. Can I ask, Mr. Banner, in -- in various kinds of ways this statute tries to reduce district courts' discretion over fees. I mean, if you take as the baseline 1988, which gives a court discretion over everything, this statute tried to pull back on that in various ways. But you're saying that in -- in -- in this particular way when it comes to allocation, we should understand Congress to have left the courts with the full discretion that -- that you can imagine. So why should we read it that way, given that in various other ways the -- the clear aim of Congress was to reduce the court's discretion? But I think -- Mr. -- Mr. Legner -- Mr. Legner, you put a lot of emphasis on the word ""satisfy"" and I think in -- in most cases you're right as to what ""satisfy"" means. I guess the question I have is whether in this context one should think that the word ""satisfy"" says anything. And -- and my question goes basically that in many cases, and probably in the vast majority of cases, no part of the judgment, including the full judgment, could possibly satisfy the fee award. So given that we're talking about a circumstance in which in the vast majority of cases the fee award is not going to be satisfied, why should we understand the word ""satisfy"" in the way that you think we should? Well, I agree with you that there might be some. But the question is, you know, would Congress have used that -- the word in your sense, knowing that in most cases it wasn't going to be full payment? It just seems as though when this statute uses the word, given what actually happens in the real world, it meant something more along the lines of contribute to the fee award. Well, I think -- I mean, I think that that's wrong. I mean, I guess what I'm suggesting is that this language should be read or could be read to say, you know, shall go towards satisfying. So a dollar would go a small way towards satisfying. Ten dollars would go a slightly larger and so forth and so on. Well, that seems right, that -- that Congress limited discretion in certain ways. The question is: Did it limit discretion in this way? But that sounds as though we're just going to interpret the statute in a general direction, no matter what. Do you have -- this is the same question that was asked of Mr. Banner. Do you have a way that Congress could have written this statute to clearly state what Mr. Banner thinks it means? You know, that's better than this? Do you have any sense of how many cases up to 25 percent of the judgment actually will be able to satisfy? No, how -- how often it is that the amount, you know, whether it's 25 percent of the judgment or some lesser amount, will actually satisfy the amount of fees awarded? ",you think it go without say that the plaintiff would have to pay the full percent because it do not say it so i think right can i ask mr banner in in various kind of way this statute try to reduce district court discretion over fee i mean if you take as the baseline which give a court discretion over everything this statute try to pull back on that in various way but you be say that in in in this particular way when it come to allocation we should understand congress to have leave the court with the full discretion that that you can imagine so why should we read it that way give that in various other way the the clear aim of congress be to reduce the court s discretion but i think mr mr legner mr legner you put a lot of emphasis on the word satisfy and i think in in most case you be right as to what satisfy mean i guess the question i have be whether in this context one should think that the word satisfy say anything and and my question go basically that in many case and probably in the vast majority of case no part of the judgment include the full judgment could possibly satisfy the fee award so give that we be talk about a circumstance in which in the vast majority of case the fee award be not go to be satisfy why should we understand the word satisfy in the way that you think we should well i agree with you that there might be some but the question be you know would congress have use that the word in your sense know that in most case it be not go to be full payment it just seem as though when this statute use the word give what actually happen in the real world it mean something more along the line of contribute to the fee award well i think i mean i think that that be wrong i mean i guess what I be suggest be that this language should be read or could be read to say you know shall go towards satisfy so a dollar would go a small way towards satisfying ten dollar would go a slightly large and so forth and so on well that seem right that that congress limit discretion in certain way the question be do it limit discretion in this way but that sound as though we be just go to interpret the statute in a general direction no matter what do you have this be the same question that be ask of mr banner do you have a way that congress could have write this statute to clearly state what mr banner think it mean you know that be good than this do you have any sense of how many case up to percent of the judgment actually will be able to satisfy no how how often it be that the amount you know whether it be percent of the judgment or some less amount will actually satisfy the amount of fee award ,199.11999999999995,Roberts Court,"Dec 6, 2017",Charles Murphy,"Robert Smith, et al.",16-1067,"Aug 25, 2017","Feb 21, 2018",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1

If I could take you back, Mr. Curran, to the text of the statute. I mean, one of the notable things about 1608(a)(4) which is not replicated in 1608(a)(3) is that 1608(a)(4) does specify an address. You know, it says addressed and dispatched by the Clerk of the Court to the Secretary of State in Washington, D.C. And -- and 1608(a)(3) does not say at his office in the Sudan. I guess I don't really quite understand that, because, here, they clearly thought that they had to specify when they wanted to specify, you know, at his office on -- on -- in -- in Washington, D.C. Well, you know, close enough. But why -- why is it any more of an affront if you send it to one place than if you send it to the other? Is there a regulation that suggests that the State Department under (a)(4) can -- can serve to the embassy if the foreign state otherwise -- if the foreign state so requests or if otherwise appropriate? So is that also a violation of the Vienna Convention?

2018,United States v. Stitt,114,Elena Kagan,"May I add a fifth? (Laughter.) Because I know there actually is a statute in Congress right now that replaces ACCA with a statute that looks to the penalties that have been given. So I guess my question is, has the department taken a position on that statute that is pending in Congress currently? May I stop you on your first point, Mr. Fisher? So the Court has indeed said many times that vehicles fall outside the generic definition of ""burglary."" But I think that when the Court said that, what it really meant was this is a way to say if -- if the -- if a statute covers basic car theft, it's outside ACCA. That's not the typical burglary offense. And the Court was not thinking about mobile homes or RVs. It just didn't have that in its head when it made those statements. So those statements really don't have much to do with the question in this case. But I don't think -- I don't think Mathis really is -- is at odds with what I was saying. Everybody in that case agreed that this covered vehicles, broadly speaking. The government conceded it, the -- the other party conceded it. All -- all -- all of the opinions viewed it that way. And so nobody really ever addressed the question of, are there different kinds of vehicles in the world? Are there cars and are there mobile homes? Your position, Mr. Fisher, is that mobile homes are included, but RVs are excluded, is that correct? Yeah, but that's -- that's what I understood you to be saying in your brief. Does any state make that distinction in its law? Could you give your view of where, if -- if we accepted your position, what that would mean in terms of how many states' laws qualified? I'm sorry, you said that in a way that -- -- that the delta, what -- what you're fighting about -- -- is in the high teens? I mean, that's significant. That's a lot. Sorry, Ms. Ross. Do you agree that if a statute covers just regular cars, that that falls outside? Nobody's living there. Nobody's doing that. You're just driving it. So -- so you're accepting that those are out? And how about the -- the ones that say vehicles that are used for business activities, commercial activities, are those in or out?

2018,Bucklew v. Precythe,114,Elena Kagan,"So are you saying, Mr. Sauer, that we would be in a different situation in this case right now if the Petitioner had instead requested an electrocution or a firing squad? May I ask a -- a different question? You know, one of the things that strike me -- strikes me, when I went back and -- and looked at Baze, there's a lot about kind of deference to a state legislature and state officials about determining the appropriate method of execution, about giving a kind of considered judgment to the sort of pain that would be expected from an execution, as well as their interests in carrying out legitimate sentences and making decisions on that basis. But what strikes me is that when we think about that, those officials really are thinking in gross, if you know what I mean. They're thinking about a method of execution as applied to the general class of people and deciding that it's appropriate. And what, of course, makes this case very different is that it's not in gross. It's a particular person that says I have a highly unusual condition that will make the execution highly unusual, that will have me suffer highly unusual pain. And in that context, I think all of that stuff that we talked about in Baze about why we should refer to state-considered judgments really falls away because there's been no considered judgment, surely by the legislature and, in general, by officials, about -- about one particular person. And it strikes me that because that's true, the way we look at a case like this has to change. So I'm -- I'm wondering, you know, what your response to that is. See, I'm not sure that that's true, because those officials are working within a system. They're working within a set of legislative rules that have been made in this sort of general sense. And for them to go outside that system would be -- you know, and say it's not appropriate for this particular person would be an extraordinary person for -- an extraordinary thing for an individual person to do. So I don't think we could realistically give the same kind of deference to that sort of decision.

2018,"Knick v. Township of Scott, Pennsylvania",114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Breemer, may I get back to this -- the question that you started off with, which is when exactly the violation occurs and why it occurs before the state denies compensation in the inverse condemnation proceeding, which is, I take it, what you're saying. Is that because -- are you saying that that's because the right to compensation is immediate; in other words, there's a right to compensation contemporaneous with the taking? Is that what your claim is? Okay -- Right. But usually -- Well, how is it clear that it's not compensating? In other words, what Justice Alito says clarifies matters considerably, that if the state has already said we're not compensating, then it seems you can claim both that you've had a taking and that the state has refused to compensate. But I thought that the question here arose from the fact that the state has not said yet that it's not compensating, that, instead, it uses the inverse condemnation proceeding to make that determination. Is that wrong? But does it? I mean, I -- I'm following Justice Alito's point exactly, except what I'm not understanding is I -- I had thought that in a case like this there had been no determination by the state that there was liability one way or the other. In other words, the state had not denied liability, nor had the state conceded liability. So this isn't a -- a question where the state has said: Look, we deny any liability. It's -- it's -- the state hasn't said one way or the other. And we're going to find out in the inverse condemnation action whether the state is, in fact, denying all liability or whether the state is going to come in and say: You're right, there is liability here, and now let's talk about how much. Right. But my question is, if the state has not denied liability yet, how do you have a Fifth Amendment claim? If the state has denied liability, if it has said we're refusing to pay, then I take Justice Alito's point exactly. Then you have both your elements of the Fifth Amendment claim. There's been a taking and the state has refused to pay just compensation, allegedly. But, if the state has not yet refused to pay, how do you have a Fifth Amendment claim? Has that ever been considered before? Because it seems a -- a way out of this difficulty. Has anybody ever addressed it? General, I assume we wouldn't have a problem here if we didn't have preclusive effect of the state action. Is that correct in your view? General, I -- you know, I read those pages in your brief a couple of times, and I have -- I have to say that they're -- it's just going over my head a little bit, how it is that you can say that there's a deprivation of a right when you simultaneously say that there's been no violation -- -- even though the government hasn't paid yet. But I think what the -- Can I go back -- Well, Ms. -- -- Ms. Sachs, I -- I think you have a pretty good argument that there's no Fifth Amendment violation until both the taking has been accomplished and there's been a denial of just compensation. And until both of those things happen, there's no claim. But I think the problem is -- and the Chief Justice referred to this -- the way that rule combines with the preclusion principles in such a way that it prevents somebody from getting into federal court at all. In other words, does -- and I don't think Williams really understood that this would happen, that saying, well, look, you have to go through the state process for determining just compensation before you can bring a federal claim, I don't think Williams understood that the result of going through the state process for determining just compensation was that you were never going to be able to bring a Fifth Amendment claim. And -- and that seems to me an issue and one that I'm trying to find my way around. And I'm wondering whether there is one. Ms. Sachs -- Ms. Sachs? I probably should know the answer to this question, but if -- if Pennsylvania, instead of using an inverse condemnation procedure, used a strictly administrative process so it didn't go to the courts, it was just some kind of administrative body, would that have the same kind of preclusive effect as a state court judgment does? ",mr breemer may i get back to this the question that you start off with which be when exactly the violation occur and why it occur before the state deny compensation in the inverse condemnation proceeding which be i take it what you be say be that because be you say that that be because the right to compensation be immediate in other word there be a right to compensation contemporaneous with the taking be that what your claim be okay right but usually well how be it clear that it be not compensate in other word what justice alito say clarify matter considerably that if the state have already say we be not compensate then it seem you can claim both that you have have a taking and that the state have refuse to compensate but i think that the question here arose from the fact that the state have not say yet that it have not compensate that instead it use the inverse condemnation proceed to make that determination be that wrong but do it i mean i I be follow justice alito s point exactly except what I be not understanding be i i have think that in a case like this there have be no determination by the state that there be liability one way or the other in other word the state have not deny liability nor have the state concede liability so this be not a a question where the state have say look we deny any liability it be it have the state have not say one way or the other and we be go to find out in the inverse condemnation action whether the state be in fact deny all liability or whether the state be go to come in and say you be right there be liability here and now let us talk about how much right but my question be if the state have not deny liability yet how do you have a fifth amendment claim if the state have deny liability if it have say we be refuse to pay then i take justice alito s point exactly then you have both your element of the fifth amendment claim there have be a taking and the state have refuse to pay just compensation allegedly but if the state have not yet refuse to pay how do you have a fifth amendment claim have that ever be consider before because it seem a a way out of this difficulty have anybody ever address it general i assume we would not have a problem here if we do not have preclusive effect of the state action be that correct in your view general i you know i read those page in your brief a couple of time and i have i have to say that they be it be just go over my head a little bit how it be that you can say that there be a deprivation of a right when you simultaneously say that there be be no violation even though the government have not pay yet but i think what the can i go back well m ms sachs i i think you have a pretty good argument that there be no fifth amendment violation until both the taking have be accomplish and there have be a denial of just compensation and until both of those thing happen there be no claim but i think the problem be and the chief justice refer to this the way that rule combine with the preclusion principle in such a way that it prevent somebody from get into federal court at all in other word do and i do not think williams really understand that this would happen that say well look you have to go through the state process for determine just compensation before you can bring a federal claim i do not think williams understand that the result of go through the state process for determine just compensation be that you we be never go to be able to bring a fifth amendment claim and and that seem to me an issue and one that I be try to find my way around and I be wonder whether there be one ms sachs ms sachs i probably should know the answer to this question but if if pennsylvania instead of use an inverse condemnation procedure use a strictly administrative process so it do not go to the court it be just some kind of administrative body would that have the same kind of preclusive effect as a state court judgment do ,270.23999999999995,Case pending,"Oct 3, 2018",Rose Mary Knick,"Township of Scott, Pennsylvania",17-647,"Mar 5, 2018",,114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2018,Culbertson v. Berryhill,114,Elena Kagan,"But I think the import of Justice Kavanaugh's question is that in the usual case in which there are proceedings both at the Commission and at a district court, and there are two 25 percent caps, it -- it's -- it's not the government's position that in that usual case where lawyers can say, well, I won here and I won there, that both of them are entitled to 25 percent fees or that both of them should get 25 percent fees. I don't -- I think, you know, what strikes me as -- as, you know, troublesome about this, and then you could add a court of appeals proceeding to it and the possibility of 75 percent fees. So, you know, could that possibly have been what Congress wanted? So, if I understand what you're saying to us, Mr. Yang, there have been -- one could respond to some of these qualms about a 50 percent fee by saying don't worry, it will never happen. But you're specifically not saying that. You're saying in a case where there are proceedings at two different levels, 50 percent fees is going to happen, and it's going to happen in order to ensure representation at both of those levels. But, Ms. Weil, I take -- I take the point, and, indeed, Mr. Yang suggested, that this happens and that it was meant to happen. But -- so -- so that's troublesome. But I'm -- I'm struggling with your textual argument. Where does it come from? I guess I -- I don't quite get the argument. You know, the ""such representation"" language says 25 percent for court representation. And then you're saying that there's some kind of implicit exclusion as to another 25 percent, or however much it is, for agency representation. Where does the exclusion come from? But the statute is set up so that there are very specific sections governing agency proceedings and court proceedings. So the statute is set up in a way that is not really consistent with that argument. It seems to treat these as two different proceedings, and it seems to treat fees for those two different proceedings as discrete inquiries. It -- it makes sense that they split them, but -- but you're not suggesting that there's any place in the statute that you can point to and say: Look, that provision is the provision where Congress indicates that it makes sense that they split them. What about the language -- I'm sorry. What -- what about the language that Mr. Yang referred to in (a)(4)? This is the language about payment in an amount equal to so much of the maximum fee as doesn't exceed 25 percent of past-due benefits, which suggests that the maximum fee could be more than 25 percent. ",but i think the import of justice kavanaugh s question be that in the usual case in which there be proceeding both at the commission and at a district court and there be two percent cap it it be it be not the government s position that in that usual case where lawyer can say well i win here and i win there that both of them be entitle to percent fee or that both of them should get percent fee i do not i think you know what strike me as as you know troublesome about this and then you could add a court of appeal proceed to it and the possibility of percent fee so you know could that possibly have be what congress want so if i understand what you be say to us mr yang there have be one could respond to some of these qualm about a percent fee by say do not worry it will never happen but you be specifically not say that you be say in a case where there be proceeding at two different level percent fee be go to happen and it be go to happen in order to ensure representation at both of those level but ms weil i take i take the point and indeed mr yang suggest that this happen and that it be mean to happen but so so that be troublesome but I be I be struggle with your textual argument where do it come from i guess i i do not quite get the argument you know the such representation language say percent for court representation and then you be say that there be some kind of implicit exclusion as to another percent or however much it be for agency representation where do the exclusion come from but the statute be set up so that there be very specific section govern agency proceeding and court proceeding so the statute be set up in a way that be not really consistent with that argument it seem to treat these as two different proceeding and it seem to treat fee for those two different proceeding as discrete inquiry it it make sense that they split them but but you be not suggest that there be any place in the statute that you can point to and say look that provision be the provision where congress indicate that it make sense that they split them what about the language I be sorry what what about the language that mr yang refer to in a this be the language about payment in an amount equal to so much of the maximum fee as do not exceed percent of past due benefit which suggest that the maximum fee could be more than percent ,167.95999999999995,Roberts Court,"Nov 7, 2018",Richard Allen Culbertson,"Nancy A.

As written, it's incoherent because a statement of policy is, by definition, not a substantive rule? Yes, but it's at least -- May -- may -- May -- may I take you back, Mr. Kneedler, to one of Justice Sotomayor's original questions, which is just what, on your theory, this provision ends up actually accomplishing? Because, as I understand the 19 -- the 1986, the -- the prior year's provision, Congress essentially already said, for Medicare substantive rules, you have to go through notice and comment. And I understand how this would have been different if it was the original version of the thing, the ""has or may have a significant effect.""

2018,Apple v. Pepper,114,Elena Kagan,"Does your answer to Justice Breyer depend on what you said, that the alleged monopolization is in the distribution function? Because I understood the -- the Respondents now to be saying, no, that's wrong; the alleged monopolization is in the apps themselves. In other words, the consumer says you have a monopoly on apps. You might also have a monopoly on the distribution function, which the app developers have to live with, but you have a monopoly on apps, which the consumers have to live with. So, in responding to Justice Breyer, you said: Well, it's because the alleged monopoly is the distribution function. But I don't think that that's correct. Well, Mr. Wall, I think you're avoiding the question a bit because, I mean, the questions that are being put to you by my colleagues are really, what was Illinois Brick about? Was it about a vertical supply chain or, instead, was it about a pass-through theory? Now, in the facts of Illinois Brick and, indeed, in the facts of all the Illinois Brick cases that we've discussed, you had both. So you didn't have to separate the two. And now, here, you don't have both, because this is not a vertical supply chain, but there still is a pass-through mechanism. So then the question is, does Illinois Brick apply to that or not? And I think what Justice Breyer was suggesting to you, that as long as it's not that vertical supply chain where the person is not buying from the monopolist itself, here, the person is transacting with the monopolist itself, that that's what separates this case from Illinois Brick and makes it entirely different, notwithstanding that there's some kind of pass-through mechanism involved. General, I have to say I find that a not intuitive argument, I mean, because it just seems to me that when you're looking at the relationship between the consumer and Apple, that there is only one step. I mean, I pick up my iPhone. I go to Apple's App Store. I pay Apple directly with the credit card information that I've supplied to Apple. From -- from my perspective, I've just engaged in a one-step transaction with Apple. And when I come in and say Apple is a monopolist and Apple is charging a super-competitive price by -- by extracting a commission that it can only extract because of its market power, I mean, there's my one step. Does it make a difference, General, that -- that Apple is influencing the prices here? In other words, this is -- you're suggesting that the app developers are just sort of setting these prices independently -- -- but I'll give you sort of two ways in which that's not true. The first way is this 99 cent charge -- -- which you might say, well, that doesn't matter because, you know, it could be 99 cents or it could be $100.99. But, in fact, these are all low-cost products for the most part. So saying a price has to end with the -- you know, the -- the number 99 is saying a lot about the fact that you can't charge 77 cents or 55 cents -- -- or 32 cents. So that's one. And the other is the entire allegation here is that Apple is truly a monopolist on both sides of the market. It's able to dictate to developers whatever price structure it wants, and it's also able to dictate to consumers what the nature of the sale is going to be. And in that event, it -- it sure seems as though, you know, Apple -- you know, it happened to set up this commission that puts it in the ambit of Illinois Brick, but it could have done a thousand other things that are essentially the same that would have taken it out of the Illinois Brick rule. But if you have to bid in $10 increments and the -- and the true alternative prices are $3, $5, and $7 -- -- then, indeed, you are setting the price. In other words, you are saying the consumer says, I'm paying a higher price for the product. It might be the entire 30 percent commission, it might be some portion of the 30 percent commission, that's super-competitive, but I'm paying a higher price for the product. And the app developer says: Well, I don't -- you know, that's irrelevant to me. I don't have to buy the product. What's relevant to me is fewer people are buying my apps. And that represents some amount of lost profits. But those two things are not -- I mean, it is true that two people are being able to sue because Apple is -- is transacting with each of these people and each of them has a gripe against what -- the way Apple has structured the market. But the damages are entirely different. One is a measure of lost profits, which may or may not exist. The other is I'm paying too much. And -- and -- and the rule of the end in 99-cent requirement in that theory is what? In other words, would your theory be the same if no such requirement existed, or would it not? So what's the significance of that end in 99-cent rule? ",do your answer to justice breyer depend on what you say that the alleged monopolization be in the distribution function because i understand the the respondent now to be say no that be wrong the allege monopolization be in the apps themselves in other word the consumer say you have a monopoly on apps you might also have a monopoly on the distribution function which the app developer have to live with but you have a monopoly on apps which the consumer have to live with so in respond to justice breyer you say well it be because the alleged monopoly be the distribution function but i do not think that that be correct well mr wall i think you be avoid the question a bit because i mean the question that be be put to you by my colleague be really what be illinois brick about be it about a vertical supply chain or instead be it about a pas through theory now in the fact of illinois brick and indeed in the fact of all the illinois brick case that we have discuss you have both so you do not have to separate the two and now here you do not have both because this be not a vertical supply chain but there still be a pas through mechanism so then the question be do illinois brick apply to that or not and i think what justice breyer be suggest to you that as long as it be not that vertical supply chain where the person be not buy from the monopolist itself here the person be transact with the monopolist itself that that be what separate this case from illinois brick and make it entirely different notwithstanding that there be some kind of pas through mechanism involve general i have to say i find that a not intuitive argument i mean because it just seem to me that when you be look at the relationship between the consumer and apple that there be only one step i mean i pick up my iphone i go to apple s app store i pay apple directly with the credit card information that I have supply to apple from from my perspective I have just engage in a one step transaction with apple and when i come in and say apple be a monopolist and apple be charge a super competitive price by by extract a commission that it can only extract because of its market power i mean there be my one step do it make a difference general that that apple be influence the price here in other word this be you be suggest that the app developer be just sort of set these price independently but I will give you sort of two way in which that be not true the first way be this cent charge which you might say well that do not matter because you know it could be cent or it could be but in fact these be all low cost product for the most part so say a price have to end with the you know the the number be say a lot about the fact that you can not charge cent or cent or cent so that be one and the other be the entire allegation here be that apple be truly a monopolist on both side of the market it be able to dictate to developer whatever price structure it want and it be also able to dictate to consumer what the nature of the sale be go to be and in that event it it sure seem as though you know apple you know it happen to set up this commission that put it in the ambit of illinois brick but it could have do a thousand other thing that be essentially the same that would have take it out of the illinois brick rule but if you have to bid in increment and the and the true alternative price be and then indeed you be set the price in other word you be say the consumer say I be pay a high price for the product it might be the entire percent commission it might be some portion of the percent commission that be super competitive but I be pay a high price for the product and the app developer say well i do not you know that be irrelevant to me i do not have to buy the product what be relevant to me be few people be buy my apps and that represent some amount of lose profit but those two thing be not i mean it be true that two people be be able to sue because apple be be transact with each of these people and each of them have a gripe against what the way apple have structure the market but the damage be entirely different one be a measure of lose profit which may or may not exist the other be I be pay too much and and and the rule of the end in cent requirement in that theory be what in other word would your theory be the same if no such requirement exist or would it not so what be the significance of that end in cent rule ,302.04,Case pending,"Nov 26, 2018","Apple, Inc.","Robert Pepper, et al.",17-204,"Jun 18, 2018",,114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1

Are there any states -- Could -- could I -- -- get your take on the question of when you're in breach. You said you're not in breach when the notice of appeal is filed. And is that true no matter what the notice of appeal says? In other words, suppose the notice of appeal is an opportunity to lay out your claims and you lay out claims that are within the waiver. Does that still, in your view, not breach the agreement? In -- in other words, if -- if there's -- if the defendant files a brief that raises issues within the scope of the waiver? And how about if there's an Anders brief that -- that raises issues within the scope of the waiver? Does that breach the defendant's bargain? Mr. Jorgensen, so on what you just said, I guess I was a little bit confused in your brief as to the scope of your argument. Suppose that the client had, you know, after doing the appeal waiver, but there are some issues that you could still bring, not very many, but some, and the client says: I want you to -- to his attorney -- I want you to appeal. And he does not give any further guidance. In other words, he doesn't say what particular issues or whether those issues are inside or outside the scope of the appeal waiver. He just thinks: I want to appeal now. Does he get to -- at that point, does the attorney have to take the appeal? Can you presume prejudice from the fact that the attorney has not taken the appeal? Yes. So that -- I guess that I had understood your brief as saying that as long as you don't specifically want to appeal something that's within the scope of the waiver, then the attorney does, in fact, have to file a notice of appeal and you can say that there is prejudice when he doesn't. But -- but -- but you're saying that even if the client makes a kind of generalized go file an appeal for me, I leave it to you, what -- how -- you know, I don't know the law, you go do it, and the attorney doesn't file anything, even then you would say that there's no presumption?

2018,"Return Mail, Inc. v. United States Postal Service",114,Elena Kagan,"Ms. Brinkmann -- Ms. Brinkmann, I -- I take it you agree that 207 does indicate that the government counts as a person for a variety of provisions, is that right? So 102, 118, 119, all of those provisions, because the Act specifically says the government can obtain a patent, it follows that those provisions apply to the government as well. Do agree with that? Right, but I guess what I'm -- I wanted to ask was whether those provisions, the 207(a)(1) that the government can obtain a patent, 207(a)(3), which is that the government can protect its rights to inventions, whether those might also lead you to say that the -- that the -- the -- that the government is a person for means of bringing these challenges, because the idea, I think, would be something like these challenges to the PTO are a means of -- enable the government to innovate and to obtain patents itself. In other words, the government is looking at an area, it says somebody is claiming a patent on this, that's preventing us from inventing, that's preventing us from getting a patent, so we have to kind of clear the field in order to innovate. And that's what these challenges enable the government to do, so that they are a kind of function of 207(a)(1) and 207(a)(3). What would you think of that argument? Mr. -- I think, Mr. Stewart, I'm -- I'm not really understanding your affirmative argument here. I mean, let's assume that you have a presumption running against you. And we can argue about how strong the presumption is, but there's at least some presumption coming from the Dictionary Act, coming from just our cases on this topic, which says that the government isn't a person unless we see evidence that it is a person. So what would you point to in this statute to tell us that the government is a person? And -- and, you know, what text are we talking about? Well, that doesn't seem -- I mean, that just is saying everybody else gets to do this. But -- What's -- what's the third? I mean, when I hear you say this, Mr. Stewart, I -- I -- I guess what I was hoping for was that you would have an argument from particular statutory provisions. I mean, I was trying to run an argument to Ms. Brinkmann about 207(a)(1) and (a)(3) and how those might suggest that the government was a person. But -- but I don't hear you saying anything like that. I hear you just saying, look, this is a broad provision and we can't think of a reason why the government shouldn't be treated like everybody else, so the government should be treated like everybody else. May I ask, Mr. Stewart, just a couple factual questions? This case is about the post office, but let's say it wasn't the post office. Let's say it was just a regular executive branch agency. Who would it be that would be making the decision whether to seek a proceeding like this? I mean, are -- is there a patent officer in every agency whose -- whose -- whose job it would be to decide when this was appropriate? I guess what I'm trying to figure out is, to the extent that you think that maybe Congress treated the government differently here because they were afraid that the government in front of the PTAB is -- has a kind of home court advantage and that they didn't want that, I guess the question is, is that true? I mean, is this a community of patent officials who talk to each other all the time across the government, who know each other, who deal with each other, or is this really stovepiped so that none of these people -- the PTAB would have no clue of who it was before them when the Department of HHS walks in? Does that presumption make any sense anymore, Ms. Brinkmann? I mean, the idea of a presumption like this is that it's a stable default rule against which Congress can operate.

2018,Madison v. Alabama,114,Elena Kagan,"In your original question presented, you ask whether a person, a prisoner whose mental disability leaves him without memory -- -- of his commission of the capital offense. So do I take you now to be saying that if you are left without memory of the commission of the capital offense for some reason that doesn't have something to do with mental disability, that's not enough? But if there's mental disability that has given rise to this lack of memory, then it is? Right. I suppose what people are thinking of, and I'm -- I'm not even sure if this happens ever or whether there's any sort of physiology behind this, but the idea of a kind of fugue state or a blackout that's unaccompanied by anything else, does that count as the kind of mental disability that you're talking about? Can I ask -- can I give you two versions of your argument and you tell me which one you're arguing? Or maybe you can tell me that there's no difference -- -- between the two. So one is just if you have severe dementia, you are incompetent to be executed. That's simple. The other is, if you have severe dementia, you are likely also to have a lack of rational understanding of the kind we talked about in Panetti. So, in other words, the dementia would be the -- the -- the -- the physiological reason, but the standard would still be the Panetti standard. Have there been changes even since 2016? Is this continuing? Well, is there ever a place where the court makes clear that it understands that insanity is not a sine qua non, that dementia could do the trick in satisfying the Ford/Panetti standard? Is there ever a place where the court says, even though, you know, I understand that I'm not necessarily looking for delusions or schizophrenia or insanity and all the -- the ways that we -- that we saw it in Ford and Panetti, that if I find somebody who's experiencing the kind of dementia that would prevent him from having a rational understanding of the crime and punishment, that that's enough? Is there ever a place where the court makes clear that it knows that? But I don't think that that does it. I mean, you can set out the Panetti standard. The question is whether you understand that dementia can be the basis for satisfying the Ford and Panetti standard. Right. But if you're just listing that evidence, what you might think as a court if you're looking for delusions is that's all relevant, I'm listing the evidence, but that's irrelevant. Is there ever a place where the court makes it clear that that is relevant? But do you see what I mean, Mr. Govan? And I won't belabor this, but you can list all the evidence and think to yourself: I'm listing all the evidence, but I find all this evidence utterly irrelevant to the legal standard because I think delusions are required to satisfy Ford and Panetti. I guess what you're saying is either way. We -- we can't tell either way whether -- is that what you're saying? We can't -- we can't tell that he thought that delusions were required, and we can't tell that -- whether he thought that dementia could satisfy? And -- and -- and what if what they meant by that was you can -- you can make him understand what is going on today, but then tomorrow he comes back and you have to do it all over again, and then tomorrow -- the next day comes back and you have to do it all over again? In other words, he -- you -- you can -- you can -- you can get him to understand something, but then he loses it. That's -- because that's the way memory works with people in this -- with this form of dementia. What about that? ",in your original question present you ask whether a person a prisoner whose mental disability leave him without memory of his commission of the capital offense so do i take you now to be say that if you be leave without memory of the commission of the capital offense for some reason that do not have something to do with mental disability that be not enough but if there have mental disability that have give rise to this lack of memory then it be right i suppose what people be think of and I be I be not even sure if this happen ever or whether there be any sort of physiology behind this but the idea of a kind of fugue state or a blackout that be unaccompanied by anything else do that count as the kind of mental disability that you be talk about can i ask can i give you two version of your argument and you tell me which one you be argue or maybe you can tell me that there be no difference between the two so one be just if you have severe dementia you be incompetent to be execute that be simple the other be if you have severe dementia you be likely also to have a lack of rational understanding of the kind we talk about in panetti so in other word the dementia would be the the the the physiological reason but the standard would still be the panetti standard have there be change even since be this continue well be there ever a place where the court make clear that it understand that insanity be not a sine qua non that dementia could do the trick in satisfy the fordpanetti standard be there ever a place where the court say even though you know i understand that I be not necessarily look for delusion or schizophrenia or insanity and all the the way that we that we saw it in ford and panetti that if i find somebody who be experience the kind of dementia that would prevent him from have a rational understanding of the crime and punishment that that be enough be there ever a place where the court make clear that it know that but i do not think that that do it i mean you can set out the panetti standard the question be whether you understand that dementia can be the basis for satisfy the ford and panetti standard right but if you be just list that evidence what you might think as a court if you be look for delusion be that be all relevant I be list the evidence but that be irrelevant be there ever a place where the court make it clear that that be relevant but do you see what i mean mr govan and i will not belabor this but you can list all the evidence and think to yourself I be list all the evidence but i find all this evidence utterly irrelevant to the legal standard because i think delusion be require to satisfy ford and panetti i guess what you be say be either way we we can not tell either way whether be that what you be say we can not we can not tell that he think that delusion we be require and we can not tell that whether he think that dementia could satisfy and and and what if what they mean by that be you can you can make him understand what be go on today but then tomorrow he come back and you have to do it all over again and then tomorrow the next day come back and you have to do it all over again in other word he you you can you can you can get him to understand something but then he lose it that be because that be the way memory work with people in this with this form of dementia what about that ,231.88,Roberts Court,"Oct 2, 2018",Vernon Madison,State of Alabama,17-7505,"Feb 26, 2018","Feb 27, 2019",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2018,Jam v. International Finance Corp.,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Ellis, before you get to that, another part of the structure is this provision that deals with presidential authority, and that's essentially a roll-back authority of immunity. Doesn't that make a lot more sense, that provision, if you assume that Congress meant for there to be absolute immunity? In other words, the presidential authority is a one-way ratchet. The President can only under this provision roll it back. It can't increase it. So, to me, if I -- if -- if -- if -- if the immunity -- if the immunity is less than absolute, you would think that they would have given the presidential authority both ways. But Mister -- Mr. Ellis, I -- I guess I'm not sure I -- I quite understood what you meant. As to the core lending activities of these multinational development banks, in other words, making loans where private actors would not make loans, do you have a view as to whether that counts as a commercial activity or not? Did you say that that would not count as a commercial activity because they're making loans that the -- that the private market would not make? But even what you just said, Mr. Verrilli, it wasn't enacted to make sure that foreign organizations would get treated the same as foreign states. I mean, that's exactly what the language of the thing says.

2018,Obduskey v. McCarthy & Holthus LLP,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Geyser, I -- I find this a difficult question. Going back to something that Justice Alito said, the reason I find it a difficult question is it seems to me that judicial foreclosures, non-judicial foreclosures, fall within both. They -- you know, these people are debt collectors under the language of the statute, and these people are enforcing security interests under the language of the statute. But that can't be right because the grammar of the statute suggests that we now have to kick them out of one or the other. All right? And so the question is, which do we kick them out of? Do we say, notwithstanding that they look like debt collectors, we're not going to treat them like debt collectors, or do we say that, notwithstanding that they enforce security interests, we're going to pretend that they don't? So, when I think about it that way, I kind of think: Well, I don't know, foreclosures are paradigmatic enforcement of security interests. There's nothing that gets more enforcing a security interest than foreclosing on a mortgage. So kicking them out of that one seems a little bit more odd than kicking them out of a very broad definition of debt collectors. But the result of that is to liquidate the debt. And I thought that your principal argument as to non-judicial foreclosures was that we should look to the real economic effect of this, which is to liquidate the debt. And just like a non-judicial foreclosure liquidates a debt, so too does repossession of the collateral do the exact same thing. It seems as though, when you get to the repo man, you're indulging in all these sort of hypertechnical distinctions, the same kind that you criticize Mr. Shanmugam for indulging in when it comes to non-judicial foreclosures. I mean, if you're going to get non-technical about it, you should carry through the non-technical, and then the repo man is in the same position as the non-judicial foreclosure person. Well, I don't really understand that, Mr. Shanmugam. I mean, the whole point of getting the security interest in the first place is so that the creditor has leverage in order to pressure the debtor to pay his debt. And -- and it's an alternative way to collect the debt if the debtor fails to do so. So how can it not be about payment of the debt? Well, whether you say that or not explicitly, isn't that how everybody understands a foreclosure notice? They're going to foreclose on my house unless I come up with my -- some money. But -- but now you're -- you're counting on your argument about sentence one again. And I think that these questions are really questions that assume that you're wrong on sentence one. Assume that these are debt collectors under the definition that Congress has gave. And the question is why we should then read an additive provision to exclude people from that general definition. Well, I guess I want to make you assume that. But just so I understand the nature of your argument, I mean, you could be saying, look, foreclosure proceedings don't fall within the general purpose definition. They only fall within the limited purpose definition. Or you could be saying, oh, gosh, we have a funny statute here, they fit within both, and now we have to figure out what to make of that. So which argument are you making? No, but you're not answering my question. Take just if you have the general purpose provision itself, do you -- only, that's the only thing that the statute says -- would foreclosure proceedings fit or not? What -- what -- what -- Go ahead. No, so if state law, if a state's non-judicial foreclosure process also allows the creditor to get a deficiency judgment, what in your view follows from that? ",mr geyser i i find this a difficult question go back to something that justice alito say the reason i find it a difficult question be it seem to me that judicial foreclosure non judicial foreclosure fall within both they you know these people be debt collector under the language of the statute and these people be enforce security interest under the language of the statute but that can not be right because the grammar of the statute suggest that we now have to kick them out of one or the other all right and so the question be which do we kick them out of do we say notwithstanding that they look like debt collector we be not go to treat them like debt collector or do we say that notwithstanding that they enforce security interest we be go to pretend that they do not so when i think about it that way i kind of think well i do not know foreclosure be paradigmatic enforcement of security interest there be nothing that get more enforce a security interest than foreclose on a mortgage so kick them out of that one seem a little bit more odd than kick them out of a very broad definition of debt collector but the result of that be to liquidate the debt and i think that your principal argument as to non judicial foreclosure be that we should look to the real economic effect of this which be to liquidate the debt and just like a non judicial foreclosure liquidate a debt so too do repossession of the collateral do the exact same thing it seem as though when you get to the repo man you be indulge in all these sort of hypertechnical distinction the same kind that you criticize mr shanmugam for indulge in when it come to non judicial foreclosure i mean if you be go to get non technical about it you should carry through the non technical and then the repo man be in the same position as the non judicial foreclosure person well i do not really understand that mr shanmugam i mean the whole point of get the security interest in the first place be so that the creditor have leverage in order to pressure the debtor to pay his debt and and it be an alternative way to collect the debt if the debtor fail to do so so how can it not be about payment of the debt well whether you say that or not explicitly be not that how everybody understand a foreclosure notice they be go to foreclose on my house unless i come up with my some money but but now you be you be count on your argument about sentence one again and i think that these question be really question that assume that you be wrong on sentence one assume that these be debt collector under the definition that congress have give and the question be why we should then read an additive provision to exclude people from that general definition well i guess i want to make you assume that but just so i understand the nature of your argument i mean you could be say look foreclosure proceeding do not fall within the general purpose definition they only fall within the limited purpose definition or you could be say oh gosh we have a funny statute here they fit within both and now we have to figure out what to make of that so which argument be you make no but you be not answer my question take just if you have the general purpose provision itself do you only that be the only thing that the statute say would foreclosure proceeding fit or not what what what go ahead no so if state law if a state s non judicial foreclosure process also allow the creditor to get a deficiency judgment what in your view follow from that ,209.72,Case pending,"Jan 7, 2019",Dennis Obduskey,"McCarthy & Holthus LLP, et al.",17-1307,"Jun 28, 2018",,114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1

And the pain and suffering as well. It's like, well, you were injured on the job and that's why you had this pain and suffering. Ms. Kovner, one of the things that strikes me as a little bit odd about an award like this fitting into the ""services rendered"" language is that, unlike most kinds of compensation that you can think of, you could get this if you were injured your first hour on the job without having worked at all, without having rendered any services at all.

2018,"Home Depot U.S.A., Inc. v. Jackson",114,Elena Kagan,"But, Mr. Barnette, as -- as Justice Sotomayor was saying, 1441(a), which is the principal removal statute, says that a civil action, not claims, but a civil action can be removed where the district courts have original jurisdiction. And what I've always taken that to mean is that to look for original jurisdiction, you look to the plaintiff's complaint, the original plaintiff. It gives you original jurisdiction. So, there, the plaintiff's complaint doesn't have any claims that belong in federal court. So where do you get the authority to remove under 1441(a)? Well, your claim might be under the original jurisdiction of the district courts if it had -- or not your claim but the claim to which you are defendant, if that had started the lawsuit. But that didn't start the lawsuit. The lawsuit, the civil action, was started by a claim that's completely non-federal in nature. And you look to the original claim to decide whether the courts have original jurisdiction, don't you? Well, it might be unusual, and it might be that the rules weren't contemplating this situation, although I don't really think that that's true, because the rules contemplate very liberal joinder and of all parties. But, regardless, the rule is the rule. And the rule says, when you try to figure out removal, you look to whether the court, the federal court, would have original jurisdiction of the case. And to do that, I mean, I have to say there's only one -- one place to look to decide whether original jurisdiction exists, and that's to the plaintiff's original complaint. I mean, the question is you would -- you would be right if this claim started -- excuse me, if this action started with the claim against you. But it didn't start with the claim against you. And you're suggesting that we essentially ignore all this language about original jurisdiction in order to, you know, get to this second claim. But the second claim isn't what counts under 1441. What counts under 1441 is the first claim. Well, it said -- I mean, to -- to -- I'm repeating myself, but to decide whether -- -- original jurisdiction exists, you look to the original claim. That's what original jurisdiction is. Mr. Barnette, under your theory, every time one party joins another party, we would have a new civil action. But we don't. We only have one civil action, and the civil action includes a multitude of claims, or can, between and among a wide range of parties. But it's only one civil action. So you're -- you're -- you're -- you're -- you're excluding one kind of claim, which is the claim against an original plaintiff, but there -- there can be many, many parties under the -- the federal rules and there can be counterclaims and there can be cross-claims and there can be impleaders and there can be all kinds of arrows going in every which direction. And you're suggesting that every one of those is a new civil action under Rule 1441(a), which is the one that I'm focusing on, and I'm suggesting that that's wrong. There's only one civil action, and it's the action that's brought by the original plaintiff. Mr. Barnette -- -- you're suggesting that we should look at this case as though the original claim never occurred and we should pretend that the claim started with the original defendant. But the case did not start with the original defendant. The civil action started with the original plaintiff, who brought a claim against a defendant, who then brought a claim against you. And this is all -- I mean, it -- of course, the claim against you is governed by Rule 23, but all of these claims are one civil action. And the question is, what gives you the ability to remove that civil action if there's no original jurisdiction over it? Over the claim, but -- -- but 1441 does not speak in terms of claims. Yeah, but the reason why claims are -- are there is that's to deal with a plaintiff that's bringing three claims and one of them raises a federal question and two of them don't. And then all that 1446 is saying is that, when you're in that position, the one claim that raises a federal question is going to be able to get you into federal court. So there's your claim-by-claim analysis. But the action is what is removed, and the action is removed by determining whether there's original jurisdiction, which is determined by looking to the original complaint. Well, original is at the beginning, isn't it? It's jurisdiction at the beginning from the original complaint. Is what you're saying, Mr. Bland, that 1446 changes a number of the procedures by which you can remove? It does not, it never before -- 1453. Right. Exactly right. I'm confusing things in an effort to make them more clear. (Laughter.) So 1453 changes a number of the procedures in 1446 so that there are different procedures in CAFA suits as to removal. 1453 does not -- does not purport to and simply does not affect the grant of removal jurisdiction. The grant of removal jurisdiction can only be found in one place, and that's in 1441(a). ",but mr barnette as as justice sotomayor be say a which be the principal removal statute say that a civil action not claim but a civil action can be remove where the district court have original jurisdiction and what I have always take that to mean be that to look for original jurisdiction you look to the plaintiff s complaint the original plaintiff it give you original jurisdiction so there the plaintiff s complaint do not have any claim that belong in federal court so where do you get the authority to remove under a well your claim might be under the original jurisdiction of the district court if it have or not your claim but the claim to which you be defendant if that have start the lawsuit but that do not start the lawsuit the lawsuit the civil action be start by a claim that be completely non federal in nature and you look to the original claim to decide whether the court have original jurisdiction do not you well it might be unusual and it might be that the rule be not contemplate this situation although i do not really think that that be true because the rule contemplate very liberal joinder and of all party but regardless the rule be the rule and the rule say when you try to figure out removal you look to whether the court the federal court would have original jurisdiction of the case and to do that i mean i have to say there be only one one place to look to decide whether original jurisdiction exists and that be to the plaintiff s original complaint i mean the question be you would you would be right if this claim start excuse me if this action start with the claim against you but it do not start with the claim against you and you be suggest that we essentially ignore all this language about original jurisdiction in order to you know get to this second claim but the second claim be not what count under what count under be the first claim well it say i mean to to I be repeat myself but to decide whether original jurisdiction exists you look to the original claim that be what original jurisdiction be mr barnette under your theory every time one party join another party we would have a new civil action but we do not we only have one civil action and the civil action include a multitude of claim or can between and among a wide range of party but it be only one civil action so you be you be you be you be you be exclude one kind of claim which be the claim against an original plaintiff but there there can be many many party under the the federal rule and there can be counterclaim and there can be cross claim and there can be impleaders and there can be all kind of arrow go in every which direction and you be suggest that every one of those be a new civil action under rule a which be the one that I be focus on and I be suggest that that be wrong there be only one civil action and it be the action that be bring by the original plaintiff mr barnette you be suggest that we should look at this case as though the original claim never occur and we should pretend that the claim start with the original defendant but the case do not start with the original defendant the civil action start with the original plaintiff who bring a claim against a defendant who then bring a claim against you and this be all i mean it of course the claim against you be govern by rule but all of these claim be one civil action and the question be what give you the ability to remove that civil action if there be no original jurisdiction over it over the claim but but do not speak in term of claim yeah but the reason why claim be be there be that be to deal with a plaintiff that be bring three claim and one of them raise a federal question and two of them do not and then all that be say be that when you be in that position the one claim that raise a federal question be go to be able to get you into federal court so there be your claim by claim analysis but the action be what be remove and the action be remove by determine whether there be original jurisdiction which be determine by look to the original complaint well original be at the beginning be not it it be jurisdiction at the beginning from the original complaint be what you be say mr bland that change a number of the procedure by which you can remove it do not it never before nan right exactly right I be confuse thing in an effort to make them more clear laughter so change a number of the procedure in so that there be different procedure in cafa suit as to removal do not do not purport to and simply do not affect the grant of removal jurisdiction the grant of removal jurisdiction can only be find in one place and that be in a ,305.6400000000001,Case pending,"Jan 15, 2019","Home Depot U.S.A., Inc.",George W.

2018,Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corp. v. Wall-Street.com,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Panner, I -- I -- I understand some of the policy arguments that you have on your side, but, I mean, the question is whether the text can -- can -- can be looked at that way. And I'll just go back to where the Chief Justice started, which is this passage in 411(a). And you have these two sentences, and the first sentence is registration has been made, and the second sentence is registration has been refused, and they're connected by a ""however."" So, you know, to me, you have these two sentences, they're in total proximity. They're both framed in the passive voice. ""Registration has been refused"" is clearly registration has been refused by the Register, not by the holder. And so it seems, you know, the only way to read this is that the ""registration has been made"" is by the Register too. Well -- well, I'm kind of with you that the word ""register"" has some flexibility to it. So you've got -- you've convinced me of that. The question is whether it has flexibility to it in 411(a). And -- and given the -- the juxtaposition between the first sentence and the second sentence, the identical grammar, the way they're connected with the ""however,"" it would just seem extremely strange to change the person who's the subject of this action. And are damages never going to be sufficient to compensate for that? And why would that be? How -- how long -- how long are the delays now? And how does that compare with what the delays were when this Act was passed? And when -- when the Act was passed, what were the delays then? Yeah, I mean, significantly shorter but still a matter of weeks and months? I mean, not just most. Ninety-seven percent, right? How often does that happen? Well, I -- -- I believe -- I believe Mr. Panner says that the function of the second sentence is to require an additional act, that notice be given to the Register. ",mr panner i i i understand some of the policy argument that you have on your side but i mean the question be whether the text can can can be look at that way and I will just go back to where the chief justice start which be this passage in a and you have these two sentence and the first sentence be registration have be make and the second sentence be registration have be refuse and they be connect by a however so you know to me you have these two sentence they be in total proximity they be both frame in the passive voice registration have be refuse be clearly registration have be refuse by the register not by the holder and so it seem you know the only way to read this be that the registration have be make be by the register too well well I be kind of with you that the word register have some flexibility to it so you have get you have convince me of that the question be whether it have flexibility to it in a and and give the the juxtaposition between the first sentence and the second sentence the identical grammar the way they be connect with the however it would just seem extremely strange to change the person who be the subject of this action and be damage never go to be sufficient to compensate for that and why would that be how how long how long be the delay now and how do that compare with what the delay we be when this act be pass and when when the act be pass what we be the delay then yeah i mean significantly short but still a matter of week and month i mean not just most ninety seven percent right how often do that happen well i i believe i believe mr panner say that the function of the second sentence be to require an additional act that notice be give to the register ,114.8,Case pending,"Jan 8, 2019",Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corporation,"Wall-Street.com, LLC, et al.",17-571,"Jun 28, 2018",,114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2018,"Mission Product Holdings, Inc. v. Tempnology, LLC",114,Elena Kagan,"When -- when you say that, Ms. Spinelli, what law do you look to to find that, to find that principle? I mean, you say you look to outside bankruptcy law. Are you looking to state law? Is it a kind of common law? But -- but the difference -- it said specifically, didn't it, what the difference it thought there was, right? Which was this quality control -- -- obligation that Justice Alito started us off with. And I guess just to take us back there, why is it that that obligation does not make trademarks different under -- you -- you say we look to state law. I mean, is it -- are you saying that there's uniform state law that says that the quality control obligation sort of makes no difference with respect to this issue, that the entire contract is not unwound? Right. I mean, the question is whether the quality control obligation makes trademarks different -- -- from normal contract law. That's the question. I mean, just thinking -- I'm sorry. You know, just thinking about that example you gave, the analogy of the --- the lessor of real property, there is in many cities background law that says once the landlord stops maintaining the property, the city insists that the tenant leave because the property isn't safe anymore. And I guess one question is whether there might be or is a similar background rule with respect to what happens to a trademark where the obligation for quality control is not being maintained? Is that a silly analogy? And -- and you don't think that there's, outside bankruptcy, any special rule for trademarks? You agree -- Well, I just want -- I want -- I want you to tell me -- and I think this is consistent with Justice Ginsburg's question -- outside bankruptcy, what would be the rule in this context, in the trademark context? Right. But the question is whether you have any authority for the proposition that trademark is different, whether there's any authority that says if you're outside bankruptcy and the licensor breaches, is there any authority for the idea that the licensee then has to stop using the mark? Okay. But that's your -- that's your bigger argument, which is not a trademark argument. Your -- that's an argument about everything, right, which is that we should not read (g) to say that, you know, what (g) says, honestly, (g) says constitutes a breach. That suggests that you just look to the effects of a breach under non-bankruptcy law. Why -- why doesn't (g) say that? But what -- but what you're saying, Mr. Hallward-Driemeier, is that -- is that what (g) tells you is that you can unwind the entire deal. And that's not the effect of a breach outside of bankruptcy in -- in -- certainly in the usual context. Well -- Well, what language are you pointing to in 36 -- 365(g) that says anything other than we look to see what happens when you breach? Well, I think we can understand it. (Laughter.) I thought you were saying exactly the opposite, Mr. Hallward-Driemeier. I mean, you said this is consistent with the rule for photocopiers. But -- so could I -- -- understand the sort of nature of the argument? I mean, you have your general argument, and the way that goes is Ms. Spinelli says the effect of rejection is breach, and you say the effect of rejection is rescission. And that's the basic argument, where, you know, honestly, Ms. Spinelli has this language that says it constitutes a breach. So -- but -- So -- but then you say, even if Ms. Spinelli is right on that and we just look to what it means to breach outside non -- outside bankruptcy law, then you say we have a special rule for trademarks because trademarks are different outside bankruptcy law, and you point us to a single Seventh Circuit case, is that correct? ",when when you say that ms spinelli what law do you look to to find that to find that principle i mean you say you look to outside bankruptcy law be you look to state law be it a kind of common law but but the difference it say specifically do not it what the difference it think there be right which be this quality control obligation that justice alito start us off with and i guess just to take us back there why be it that that obligation do not make trademark different under you you say we look to state law i mean be it be you say that there be uniform state law that say that the quality control obligation sort of make no difference with respect to this issue that the entire contract be not unwound right i mean the question be whether the quality control obligation make trademark different from normal contract law that be the question i mean just think I be sorry you know just think about that example you give the analogy of the the lessor of real property there be in many city background law that say once the landlord stop maintain the property the city insist that the tenant leave because the property be not safe anymore and i guess one question be whether there might be or be a similar background rule with respect to what happen to a trademark where the obligation for quality control be not be maintain be that a silly analogy and and you do not think that there be outside bankruptcy any special rule for trademark you agree well i just want i want i want you to tell me and i think this be consistent with justice ginsburg s question outside bankruptcy what would be the rule in this context in the trademark context right but the question be whether you have any authority for the proposition that trademark be different whether there be any authority that say if you be outside bankruptcy and the licensor breach be there any authority for the idea that the licensee then have to stop use the mark okay but that be your that be your big argument which be not a trademark argument your that be an argument about everything right which be that we should not read g to say that you know what g say honestly g say constitute a breach that suggest that you just look to the effect of a breach under non bankruptcy law why why do not g say that but what but what you be say mr hallward driemeier be that be that what g tell you be that you can unwind the entire deal and that be not the effect of a breach outside of bankruptcy in in certainly in the usual context well well what language be you point to in g that say anything other than we look to see what happen when you breach well i think we can understand it laughter i think you we be say exactly the opposite mr hallward driemeier i mean you say this be consistent with the rule for photocopier but so could i understand the sort of nature of the argument i mean you have your general argument and the way that go be ms spinelli say the effect of rejection be breach and you say the effect of rejection be rescission and that be the basic argument where you know honestly ms spinelli have this language that say it constitute a breach so but so but then you say even if ms spinelli be right on that and we just look to what it mean to breach outside non outside bankruptcy law then you say we have a special rule for trademark because trademark be different outside bankruptcy law and you point us to a single seventh circuit case be that correct ,224.88,Case pending,"Feb 20, 2019","Mission Product Holdings, Inc.","Tempnology, LLC",17-1657,"Oct 26, 2018",,114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2018,Nieves v. Bartlett,114,Elena Kagan,"But -- but I think what Justice Alito is suggesting is that in the second category of cases -- and you can think of it as the journalist case or you can think of it as a case where an individual police officer, you know, decides to arrest for jaywalking somebody wearing a Black Lives Matter T-shirt or, alternatively, a Make America Great Again cap or something like that, you know, that -- that -- that there might be probable cause. The person jaywalked. He jaywalked. And the point is that there are so many laws that people can break that police officers generally look the other way, but, you know, you're saying something that the officer doesn't much like, so he doesn't look the other way. You know, they're driving and they have a bumper sticker that the police officer doesn't like and he pulls them over when he wouldn't otherwise pull them over because the person had failed to signal a turn. Well, Mr. Wall, I mean, in the Fourth Amendment context, for example, the fact that there's a probable cause requirement is a function of the substance of the Fourth Amendment. What's unusual about this case is that you're asking for a probable cause requirement that bears no relationship to the actual First Amendment violation. In other words, it makes no difference to the First Amendment that there might have been probable cause for an arrest if, in fact, the arrest occurred as a result of retaliation for protected speech. But, as I read Hartman, Hartman was very dependent on two factors, neither of which is here. The first is that the prosecutor is absolutely immune, so that you were dealing with upstream actors, and the causation was very difficult. And the second was that there was a presumption of regularity that attached to prosecutorial action. And the combination of both those things meant that the Court said, you know what, in the usual case or in the -- you know, in the more than usual case, in the almost always case, the prosecutor's action has cleansed whatever retaliatory -- retaliatory motive you can find further upstream. And, here, neither one of those two things is true. Can we go back to what you said about Devenpeck, Mr. Wall? Because I'm just not sure I understood it. You said you think that the government has the right view, which is that the Devenpeck rule should apply here, but -- there was a ""but"" at the end of the sentence. And what was the ""but""? But, Mr. Wilson, I think, you know, it's obvious what the paradigm case is that gives a problem to this side, but it's also obvious what the paradigm case is that gives a problem to you, and it's the one that Justice Alito mentioned earlier on. It's an encounter between a police officer and a citizen that goes south. And part of going south is that the person who is stopped engages in lots of back-talk to the police officer, which, in combination with some forms of conduct, gives the police officer reason to think that the person should be arrested to prevent some real harm. So whether it's a resisting arrest arrest or whether, you know, it's a disorderly conduct or whatever it is, and there's likely to be speech involved in those problematic encounters where we think it's possible that the police officer should arrest the person in order to prevent any greater danger. So -- so what do we do with that category of cases? Well, what does that mean? What kind of evidence do you need? Do you need the -- the -- the person who is bringing the suit to say the officer said that he was arresting me because of something I said? Is that what you're looking for? But that just sounds like a jury question. So we would be sending every single one of these cases to a jury. Mr. -- Mr. Wilson, I'm wondering what you make of Mr. Wall's proposal. Or maybe he wouldn't call it a proposal; maybe he would call it a fallback position. But the idea that there is a probable cause requirement but that it's limited in particular by getting rid of the Devenpeck rule, so it would be limited to crimes that are identified by a police officer around the time of the arrest. I think the Petitioners say that that was because there was no right to arrest at all. ",but but i think what justice alito be suggest be that in the second category of case and you can think of it as the journalist case or you can think of it as a case where an individual police officer you know decide to arrest for jaywalk somebody wear a black live matter t shirt or alternatively a make america great again cap or something like that you know that that that there might be probable because the person jaywalk he jaywalk and the point be that there be so many law that people can break that police officer generally look the other way but you know you be say something that the officer do not much like so he do not look the other way you know they be drive and they have a bumper sticker that the police officer do not like and he pull them over when he would not otherwise pull them over because the person have fail to signal a turn well mr wall i mean in the fourth amendment context for example the fact that there be a probable because requirement be a function of the substance of the fourth amendment what be unusual about this case be that you be ask for a probable because requirement that bear no relationship to the actual first amendment violation in other word it make no difference to the first amendment that there might have be probable because for an arrest if in fact the arrest occur as a result of retaliation for protected speech but as i read hartman hartman be very dependent on two factor neither of which be here the first be that the prosecutor be absolutely immune so that you we be deal with upstream actor and the causation be very difficult and the second be that there be a presumption of regularity that attach to prosecutorial action and the combination of both those thing mean that the court say you know what in the usual case or in the you know in the more than usual case in the almost always case the prosecutor s action have cleanse whatever retaliatory retaliatory motive you can find further upstream and here neither one of those two thing be true can we go back to what you say about devenpeck mr wall because I be just not sure i understand it you say you think that the government have the right view which be that the devenpeck rule should apply here but there be a but at the end of the sentence and what be the but but mr wilson i think you know it be obvious what the paradigm case be that give a problem to this side but it be also obvious what the paradigm case be that give a problem to you and it be the one that justice alito mention earlier on it be an encounter between a police officer and a citizen that go south and part of go south be that the person who be stop engages in lot of back talk to the police officer which in combination with some form of conduct give the police officer reason to think that the person should be arrest to prevent some real harm so whether it be a resist arrest arrest or whether you know it be a disorderly conduct or whatever it be and there be likely to be speech involve in those problematic encounter where we think it be possible that the police officer should arrest the person in order to prevent any great danger so so what do we do with that category of case well what do that mean what kind of evidence do you need do you need the the the person who be bring the suit to say the officer say that he be arrest me because of something i say be that what you be look for but that just sound like a jury question so we would be send every single one of these case to a jury mr mr wilson I be wonder what you make of mr wall s proposal or maybe he would not call it a proposal maybe he would call it a fallback position but the idea that there be a probable because requirement but that it be limit in particular by get rid of the devenpeck rule so it would be limit to crime that be identify by a police officer around the time of the arrest i think the petitioner say that that be because there be no right to arrest at all ,251.92,Case pending,"Nov 26, 2018","Luis A.

2018,Thacker v. Tennessee Valley Authority,114,Elena Kagan,"Well, that's true -- please. Right. But that makes it sound, Mr. Rouse, and I think this is what everybody is getting to, is that you're saying in most cases we have the discretionary function exception. And here, with respect to the TVA or other entities like the TVA, we're essentially going to have a discretionary function exception light. We're going to have something where we look to the same concerns, the same animating purposes, but we just have a higher bar. Is that what we're doing, or is it a different inquiry in kind? Well, that's what I'm not getting, because if you, again, focus, as Justice Sotomayor said, on the question of intrusion, impedement of -- of government operations, it seems like the same inquiry, just a higher standard -- -- a higher bar. You see, I think, Mr. Rouse, what Justice Alito may be offering you is a way out of the difficulty of some of these questions, is that, with respect to some of the TVA's functions, we shouldn't be applying something that's sort of like the discretionary function exception but not really like the discretionary function exception. Rather, we should be applying nothing. With respect to the commercial functions of the TVA, the TVA ought to be treated just like any other corporate entity. But I think people are actually a little bit more interested in the second prong of -- of Burr, which is the interference with government operations. So, if you were to answer Justice Kavanaugh's question and say this is not the conduct that should be immune from suit because, how would you finish the sentence in thinking about the second prong of Burr? But, Ms. O'Connell, how does that make it any different from all the agencies that are subject to the FTCA? In other words, your brief says over and over again -- and you have to say this, because we've said it would be improper simply to engraft the FTCA exception onto agencies that have been excluded from the FTCA in whole or in part. But the test that you're giving us would essentially do the exact same thing, wouldn't it? It would exempt the TVA from exactly the same suits that the TVA would be exempted from if the TVA were included in the Well, in terms of discretionary decision-making, what -- what would be different? I mean, what would be the consequence of the fact that Congress specifically excluded the TVA from the FTCA that's really of any meaning? I know you said that there are some procedural differences in how you bring a suit, but that's really of any meaning to anybody. Well, in terms of what would there be a difference? No, my question is what's the practical difference, given your position, that the FT -- that the TVA was excluded? What's the difference for the TV -- TVA -- -- that it was excluded? Not the reasons. What's the practical consequence of being excluded? But, Ms. O'Connell, I -- I think -- Ms. -- Ms. O'Connell, if -- if -- if -- if I'm a Tennessee resident and I can't sue the TVA for this conduct, for raising a transmission line negligently, what kind of negligent suit can I bring against the TVA? Okay. But, with respect to the TVA's actual operations in running a power company, what kind of negligence suit can I bring? I mean, you know, somebody rear-ending you, it's just -- it could be a TVA driver or it could be anybody else on the road. The point is in -- in the -- in the functions that are necessary to run a power company, like raising transmission lines, doing all the things that are necessary to run a power line, what could a Tennessee citizen sue the FD -- the TVA for? But, if -- if your answer to Justice Kavanaugh is right, that would mean you are engrafting the FTCA exception onto the TVA, an -- an entity that has been specifically excluded from the FTCA. But you see what I'm saying, Ms. O'Connell. It's that those are -- it's -- you know, you can say, well, we're -- we're -- we're formulating the result in a different way. We're not engrafting the FTCA exception; rather, we're engrafting an exception that the FTCA codified. But it all amounts to the same thing, doesn't it? Yeah. Just on the facts of this case, why would allowing a negligence suit to proceed interfere with important government functions? ",well that be true please right but that make it sound mr rouse and i think this be what everybody be get to be that you be say in most case we have the discretionary function exception and here with respect to the tva or other entity like the tva we be essentially go to have a discretionary function exception light we be go to have something where we look to the same concern the same animating purpose but we just have a high bar be that what we be do or be it a different inquiry in kind well that be what I be not get because if you again focus as justice sotomayor say on the question of intrusion impedement of of government operation it seem like the same inquiry just a high standard a high bar you see i think mr rouse what justice alito may be offer you be a way out of the difficulty of some of these question be that with respect to some of the tva s function we should not be apply something that be sort of like the discretionary function exception but not really like the discretionary function exception rather we should be apply nothing with respect to the commercial function of the tva the tva ought to be treat just like any other corporate entity but i think people be actually a little bit more interested in the second prong of of burr which be the interference with government operation so if you we be to answer justice kavanaugh s question and say this be not the conduct that should be immune from suit because how would you finish the sentence in think about the second prong of burr but ms oconnell how do that make it any different from all the agency that be subject to the ftca in other word your brief say over and over again and you have to say this because we have say it would be improper simply to engraft the ftca exception onto agency that have be exclude from the ftca in whole or in part but the test that you be give us would essentially do the exact same thing would not it it would exempt the tva from exactly the same suit that the tva would be exempt from if the tva we be include in the well in term of discretionary decision making what what would be different i mean what would be the consequence of the fact that congress specifically exclude the tva from the ftca that be really of any meaning i know you say that there be some procedural difference in how you bring a suit but that be really of any meaning to anybody well in term of what would there be a difference no my question be what be the practical difference give your position that the ft that the tva be exclude what be the difference for the tv tva that it be exclude not the reason what be the practical consequence of be exclude but ms oconnell i i think m ms oconnell if if if if I be a tennessee resident and i can not sue the tva for this conduct for raise a transmission line negligently what kind of negligent suit can i bring against the tva okay but with respect to the tva s actual operation in run a power company what kind of negligence suit can i bring i mean you know somebody rear end you it be just it could be a tva driver or it could be anybody else on the road the point be in in the in the function that be necessary to run a power company like raise transmission line do all the thing that be necessary to run a power line what could a tennessee citizen sue the fd the tva for but if if your answer to justice kavanaugh be right that would mean you be engraft the ftca exception onto the tva an an entity that have be specifically exclude from the ftca but you see what I be say ms oconnell it be that those be it be you know you can say well we be we be we be formulate the result in a different way we be not engraft the ftca exception rather we be engraft an exception that the ftca codify but it all amount to the same thing do not it yeah just on the fact of this case why would allow a negligence suit to proceed interfere with important government function ,265.48,Case pending,"Jan 14, 2019","Gary Thacker, et ux.",Tennessee Valley Authority,17-1201,"Sep 27, 2018",,114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2018,"Washington State Department of Licensing v. Cougar Den, Inc.",114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Purcell -- -- there are a lot of issues in this case, but just to make it easier for me, could I ask you to assume a couple of them and then could -- we could focus on one? So you know one issue is does the right to travel include the right to travel with goods, and I'm going to ask you to just assume that it does. And then another question is, does this treaty preempt generally applicable taxes? And I'm -- that's -- you've been talking a lot about that. And I'm just going to ask you to assume that it does. In other words, you know, if -- if -- if you have a toll on a road, for example, the fact that it's generally applicable, you still can't apply it to members of the Yakama Nation. I'm just going to ask you -- -- to assume that, okay? So, if both of those things are true, then it seems to me we come -- to me, the hardest issue, which is how do we look at this tax? Do we look at it as a tax that is preventing the Yakama from doing exactly what they bargained for in this treaty; in other words, it -- you know, it's not preventing but burdening the Yakama from traveling on roads with goods, or you keep on saying, well, no, because it's not targeted at that. It's not directed at that. It's a more broad tax on the possession of fuel. And I guess what I want to ask you is why that matters. I mean, it -- it does seem to me that from the Yakama's point of view, and they're, after all, the people who entered into the treaty, from the Yakama's point of view, this tax is burdening exactly what they bargained to get, which is the ability to transport their goods without any burdens, without a tax. I know -- maybe I'm not making myself clear. You're sort of saying, well, the tax applies in other circumstances to people who aren't transporting fuel. But I'm saying, from the Yakama's point of view, they're transporting goods on the road, exactly as the treaty says they can, and why do they care if you apply your tax in other circumstances as well? Why should they care? Why does it matter what the full scope of the tax is if, from the Yakama's point of view, the tax burdens exactly what they got as a result of its treaty? But what the treaty seems to present -- prevent is the state from taxing either travel or, as Justice Kavanaugh says, travel with goods. Isn't that exactly what they got in exchange for their land? Well, the -- the tax legislation taxes a wide range of activities. One is it taxes fuel that's removed in the state from a refinery, but the one that's being applied here is that it taxes motor vehicle fuel entering into this state. So entering into, this is a pretty standard importation tax, which is to say that it's taxing the travel of goods into the state, which, again, seems to be what the Yakama got as a result of this treaty: the ability to take goods to market and to take goods from market, regardless where that market is. Do you -- do you contest -- I mean, if you said what is Cougar Den doing, how would you describe what Cougar Den is doing, what its activity is? Because the way I would describe Cougar Den's activity is that it's bringing goods from market. I just really asked how would you describe Cougar Den's activity. You would describe it as possessing fuel as opposed to transporting fuel? So if Jack says I'm taking my pigs to market, and somebody says, what are you doing, Jack? He says, well, I'm taking my pigs to market. No, I think you're possessing your pigs, Jack. But I think what is at issue is the transport of goods to and from the market, which is what it seems the Yakama is engaging in here. But if -- if I disagree with you on that -- and I hadn't understood that you were taking that position in your brief -- but if I disagree with you on that and I use -- and I understand ""in common with"" the way Tulee understood ""in common with,"" then it seems, well, there they are, they're doing what this treaty says that the -- that this -- they're doing exactly what this treaty protects, which is transporting goods to and from market. But not because of the -- but not at the movement point, not -- not when it -- the -- the goods go from one state to another on the highway. Well, it might be thin, but shouldn't we say that the state has to do things the right way, which is to say the state has to do things without violating the treaty. And if the state has another way to do it, go for it. But what the state has done is to tax exactly the activity that's protected under the treaty, which is the -- which is the transportation of goods to and from market. Well, it uses the word enter. Enter is a -- It's a movement. Enter. Mr. Unikowsky -- Mr. Unikowsky -- -- it seems to me you can look at this in one of two ways, and which way you look at it, in part, you know, suggests who should win. The first is you -- you could say: What is the taxpayer here doing? Is what the taxpayer here doing within the terms of the treaty? And there, it just seems to me that you win because what the taxpayer is doing is transporting goods to and from market. You can say he's possessing the goods. You can say he's breathing while he's transporting the goods. But what he's doing is transporting goods to and from market. So -- so that suggests that you should win, where the focus is on the activity taxed. But what I hear the state and the SG in its brief saying is you shouldn't focus on the thing that the taxpayer is doing, you should instead sort of look to the purpose of the state. You should look to what is the full scope of activities that the state is trying to tax and why they have this tax. And according to them, they have this tax because they want to get to every single taxpayer who possesses fuel in the state. And this is what's necessary to get to Yakama taxpayers. So what should we focus on: the activity that the taxpayer is doing or the purpose of the state legislation? But on -- on that one, didn't Mr. Unikowsky say, consistent with our case law, that there's a difference between taxation and regulation? ",mr purcell there be a lot of issue in this case but just to make it easy for me could i ask you to assume a couple of them and then could we could focus on one so you know one issue be do the right to travel include the right to travel with good and I be go to ask you to just assume that it do and then another question be do this treaty preempt generally applicable tax and I be that be you have be talk a lot about that and I be just go to ask you to assume that it do in other word you know if if if you have a toll on a road for example the fact that it be generally applicable you still can not apply it to member of the yakama nation I be just go to ask you to assume that okay so if both of those thing be true then it seem to me we come to me the hard issue which be how do we look at this tax do we look at it as a tax that be prevent the yakama from do exactly what they bargain for in this treaty in other word it you know it be not prevent but burden the yakama from travel on road with good or you keep on say well no because it be not target at that it be not direct at that it be a more broad tax on the possession of fuel and i guess what i want to ask you be why that matter i mean it it do seem to me that from the yakama s point of view and they be after all the people who enter into the treaty from the yakama s point of view this tax be burden exactly what they bargain to get which be the ability to transport their good without any burden without a tax i know maybe I be not make myself clear you be sort of say well the tax applies in other circumstance to people who be not transport fuel but I be say from the yakama s point of view they be transport good on the road exactly as the treaty say they can and why do they care if you apply your tax in other circumstance as well why should they care why do it matter what the full scope of the tax be if from the yakama s point of view the tax burden exactly what they get as a result of its treaty but what the treaty seem to present prevent be the state from tax either travel or as justice kavanaugh say travel with good be not that exactly what they get in exchange for their land well the the tax legislation tax a wide range of activity one be it tax fuel that be remove in the state from a refinery but the one that be be apply here be that it tax motor vehicle fuel enter into this state so enter into this be a pretty standard importation tax which be to say that it be tax the travel of good into the state which again seem to be what the yakama get as a result of this treaty the ability to take good to market and to take good from market regardless where that market be do you do you contest i mean if you say what be cougar den do how would you describe what cougar den be do what its activity be because the way i would describe cougar den s activity be that it be bring good from market i just really asked how would you describe cougar den s activity you would describe it as possess fuel as oppose to transport fuel so if jack say I be take my pig to market and somebody say what be you do jack he say well I be take my pig to market no i think you be possess your pig jack but i think what be at issue be the transport of good to and from the market which be what it seem the yakama be engage in here but if if i disagree with you on that and i have not understood that you we be take that position in your brief but if i disagree with you on that and i use and i understand in common with the way tulee understood in common with then it seem well there they be they be do what this treaty say that the that this they be do exactly what this treaty protect which be transport good to and from market but not because of the but not at the movement point not not when it the the good go from one state to another on the highway well it might be thin but should not we say that the state have to do thing the right way which be to say the state have to do thing without violate the treaty and if the state have another way to do it go for it but what the state have do be to tax exactly the activity that be protect under the treaty which be the which be the transportation of good to and from market well it use the word enter enter be a it be a movement enter mr unikowsky mr unikowsky it seem to me you can look at this in one of two way and which way you look at it in part you know suggests who should win the first be you you could say what be the taxpayer here do be what the taxpayer here do within the term of the treaty and there it just seem to me that you win because what the taxpayer be do be transport good to and from market you can say he be possess the good you can say he be breathe while he be transport the good but what he be do be transport good to and from market so so that suggest that you should win where the focus be on the activity taxed but what i hear the state and the sg in its brief say be you should not focus on the thing that the taxpayer be do you should instead sort of look to the purpose of the state you should look to what be the full scope of activity that the state be try to tax and why they have this tax and accord to them they have this tax because they want to get to every single taxpayer who possess fuel in the state and this be what be necessary to get to yakama taxpayer so what should we focus on the activity that the taxpayer be do or the purpose of the state legislation but on on that one do not mr unikowsky say consistent with our case law that there be a difference between taxation and regulation ,387.52,Case

2018,Franchise Tax Board of California v. Hyatt,114,Elena Kagan,"But just so I understand you -- Mr. Waxman, just so I understand you, are you saying that the states, pre the Constitution, were in the same position as foreign nations? In other words, it was -- their immunity then was a matter of comity, rather than as -- a matter of legal requirement? Is that correct? Well, that's what I understood -- Mr. Waxman, that's what I understood your basic argument to be, right, that there was this system of comity, it all worked very well, essentially at least in part because states knew that they had all these powers that they could use against each other, and then they gave up those powers at the convention. So what replaced it? What replaced it was a constitutional rule. That's your basic story. Is that correct? And I guess I just find myself thinking that, I mean, sort of, you know, going back to Justice Sotomayor's question, what's the evidence of that, because this is a gigantic constitute -- you know, constitutional debate. There are a thousand issues on the table. Everybody has things that they want. And this idea that there's this one-for-one exchange that you have, we give up our power to blockade, we get a rule of sovereign immunity, I mean, that's just not how big negotiations work. And unless you can show me evidence that that was the trade, I mean, if I could just -- if you would bear with me for one more moment -- Professors Baude and Sachs tell about another trade. Their trade is that there wasn't a rule of sovereign immunity, but the states retained their ability not to enforce judgments against them if they violated their own immunity. So I guess what I'm saying is all of these trades, you can hypothesize them, but they are just hypotheses. And what's the evidence for any of them? Mr. Waxman, if I could take you back to some of the questions you were previously asking, because I want to give you a chance to sort of give your best argument, which is, you know, given that you're claiming that the system of comity, which was working well for all the states, that this system was converted into a particular constitutional rule at the framing, and a very particular one, because there could have been other ways, as Professors Baude and Sachs suggest, for the states to protect themselves. Given that that's what you're claiming, what is the best -- and I'll -- I'll expand what some of my colleagues had said. You don't have to give me even textual evidence. What's the best textual or historical evidence that the states made exactly this bargain at the framing? How -- how should we think about the fact that 47 or 45 or whatever it is states have joined in this amicus brief, indicating that they think that their sovereign immunity power is a good deal more important than the power that you've referenced to protect their own citizens in their own courts? Have there been attempts -- Have there been attempts by the states to -- to enter into agreements of this sort? ",but just so i understand you mr waxman just so i understand you be you say that the state pre the constitution we be in the same position as foreign nation in other word it be their immunity then be a matter of comity rather than as a matter of legal requirement be that correct well that be what i understood mr waxman that be what i understand your basic argument to be right that there be this system of comity it all work very well essentially at least in part because state knew that they have all these power that they could use against each other and then they give up those power at the convention so what replace it what replace it be a constitutional rule that be your basic story be that correct and i guess i just find myself think that i mean sort of you know go back to justice sotomayor s question what be the evidence of that because this be a gigantic constitute you know constitutional debate there be a thousand issue on the table everybody have thing that they want and this idea that there be this one for one exchange that you have we give up our power to blockade we get a rule of sovereign immunity i mean that be just not how big negotiation work and unless you can show me evidence that that be the trade i mean if i could just if you would bear with me for one more moment professor baude and sachs tell about another trade their trade be that there be not a rule of sovereign immunity but the state retain their ability not to enforce judgment against them if they violate their own immunity so i guess what I be say be all of these trade you can hypothesize them but they be just hypothesis and what be the evidence for any of them mr waxman if i could take you back to some of the question you we be previously ask because i want to give you a chance to sort of give your best argument which be you know give that you be claim that the system of comity which be work well for all the state that this system be convert into a particular constitutional rule at the framing and a very particular one because there could have be other way as professor baude and sachs suggest for the state to protect themselves give that that be what you be claim what be the best and I will I will expand what some of my colleague have say you do not have to give me even textual evidence what be the best textual or historical evidence that the state make exactly this bargain at the framing how how should we think about the fact that or or whatever it be state have join in this amicus brief indicate that they think that their sovereign immunity power be a good deal more important than the power that you have reference to protect their own citizen in their own court have there be attempt have there be attempt by the state to to enter into agreement of this sort ,182.05,Case pending,"Jan 9, 2019",Franchise Tax Board of California,Gilbert P.

2018,Lorenzo v. Securities and Exchange Commission,114,Elena Kagan,"But the same point can be made, Mr. Heim, with respect to 10b-5(a) and (c) and also with respect to 17(a)(1) and (3), right? That the idea is -- is, look, Janus was a decision that -- it was a very textual decision. Its -- it interpreted the word ""make."" Its -- it had lots of examples from real life about who makes statements and who doesn't make statements. And neither (a) or (c) in 10b-5 has the same language in it. So you think that (a) and (c) are sort of any -- everything except misrepresentations or omissions? Is that your position? So take this case. Mr. Lorenzo here sent false financial information to potential investors. He was -- when he did that, he was the head of the investment banking division. And he sent this false financial information. And you concede -- in your yellow brief, you conceded quite a few times that he did so with an intent to defraud. So he -- he sent -- he presses send, and -- and an email is sent that contains false financial information. And I'm looking -- for example, I'm looking at the language of 10b-5(c). Do you think he has not engaged in an act which operates as a fraud? We do what? We? I guess I'm wondering, just take -- I understand that argument, and it's, I think, a serious argument. But pretend that 10b-5(b) was not in the statute for just a second, and you're entitled to come back to it, but just pretend it wasn't in the statute. Is the behavior that was charged here and that you've conceded was done with an intent to deceive, is that engaging in an act that would operate as a fraud? Mr. Heim, if I understand your position, it's irrespective of that fact. In other words, suppose that Mr. Lorenzo had made the email -- had -- had -- had come up with the email himself. If I understand your position, you would say, well, it's still not part of 10b-5(c) because that's a misrepresentation, and misrepresentations can only be charged under 10b-5(b). Isn't that what you would say? I thought that that was what you just told me. If I could -- But, Mr. Heim, we've made very clear in Central Bank that this idea of primary and secondary, if your actions fit within the language of the particular provision of the statute that you're charged on, then you're a primary violator of that provision. Right? And even if, given some other language, you wouldn't be, or given, you know, some more common -- you know, some -- some other understanding of what it means, if you fit within the language and you violate that language, you're a primary violator. That's what we said in Central Bank. And I guess the import of these questions is he fit within that language. He engaged in an act that operated as a fraud. Well, because -- that is useful because there are some people who don't fall within the language of the statute and, nonetheless, can be charged as an aider and abetter under Section 20, if the SEC does it, if it's not a private action. But what we said in Central Bank is, look, if you do the thing that's -- that is described in a particular subsection of this statute or of the -- or of 10b-5, the rule that implements it, then you're a primary violator as to that subsection. Well, those would have been bad too, but I guess I just don't get why the act that he did engage in is not an act that operates as a fraud? Well, that's -- you're quoting me (a) and I was using the language of (c), although, honestly, one could just as well use the language of (a) because we've said that a -- a fraudulent device is just a scheme to defraud. I have to say I think that that works against you, that principle, because, you're right, that all of 10b-5 is coming off of 10(b), which refers only to manipulative or deceptive devices or contrivances, but it's well understood that misrepresentations or omissions are manipulative or deceptive devices or contrivances, and just those misrepresentations alone. I mean, if -- if some of your arguments were correct, if you took them to their logical extent, you would have to say that misrepresentations and omissions don't fall within that language of 10(b). I understand, but your argument would also take out the makers of those misstatements. Well, you -- you're suggesting that because (b) refers specifically to misrepresentations, that those misrepresentations do not fall within (a) or (c). But I guess, to understand that view of the Act, which is everything prohibits something different, you would have to, for example, think that (a) and (c) are mutually exclusive. What's the difference between (a) and (c)? Well, no, but we have to understand what the statute is about. You're presenting one view of the statute, which is that each of these -- or the rule, which -- which is that each of these different sections is -- is apart from each -- is apart from the rest, that each prohibits a different thing from the -- and I guess I'm suggesting a different view of the statute, which -- which is -- which (a) and (c) make pretty clear, that these are very overlapping. One overlaps the other overlaps the other. They're all meant to essentially address the same thing. This is a kind of belt-and-suspenders statute, where it's like we're going to find every possible way to say this thing in order to make sure that fraudulent acts are covered. But then I'm going to ask you again, what's the difference in meaning between (a) and (c)? Okay. All right. Deception, I think of fraud. Well, are you? Because there's another statute -- -- too, which is Section 17. I think he was saying something to the effect of, if it's only statements, it can't be conduct. Yeah, it took acts to get to those minds, right? No, it can't cause the deception unless it gets to those readers. ",but the same point can be make mr heim with respect to b a and c and also with respect to a and right that the idea be be look janus be a decision that it be a very textual decision its it interpret the word make its it have lot of example from real life about who make statement and who do not make statement and neither a or c in b have the same language in it so you think that a and c be sort of any everything except misrepresentation or omission be that your position so take this case mr lorenzo here send false financial information to potential investor he be when he do that he be the head of the investment banking division and he send this false financial information and you concede in your yellow brief you concede quite a few time that he do so with an intent to defraud so he he send he press send and and an email be send that contain false financial information and I be look for example I be look at the language of b c do you think he have not engage in an act which operate as a fraud we do what we i guess I be wonder just take i understand that argument and it be i think a serious argument but pretend that b b be not in the statute for just a second and you be entitle to come back to it but just pretend it be not in the statute be the behavior that be charge here and that you have concede be do with an intent to deceive be that engage in an act that would operate as a fraud mr heim if i understand your position it be irrespective of that fact in other word suppose that mr lorenzo have make the email have have have come up with the email himself if i understand your position you would say well it be still not part of b c because that be a misrepresentation and misrepresentation can only be charge under b b be not that what you would say i think that that be what you just tell me if i could but mr heim we have make very clear in central bank that this idea of primary and secondary if your action fit within the language of the particular provision of the statute that you be charge on then you be a primary violator of that provision right and even if give some other language you would not be or give you know some more common you know some some other understanding of what it mean if you fit within the language and you violate that language you be a primary violator that be what we say in central bank and i guess the import of these question be he fit within that language he engage in an act that operate as a fraud well because that be useful because there be some people who do not fall within the language of the statute and nonetheless can be charge as an aider and abetter under section if the sec do it if it be not a private action but what we say in central bank be look if you do the thing that be that be describe in a particular subsection of this statute or of the or of b the rule that implement it then you be a primary violator as to that subsection well those would have be bad too but i guess i just do not get why the act that he do engage in be not an act that operate as a fraud well that be you be quote me a and i be use the language of c although honestly one could just as well use the language of a because we have say that a a fraudulent device be just a scheme to defraud i have to say i think that that work against you that principle because you be right that all of b be come off of b which refer only to manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance but it be well understood that misrepresentation or omission be manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance and just those misrepresentation alone i mean if if some of your argument we be correct if you take them to their logical extent you would have to say that misrepresentation and omission do not fall within that language of b i understand but your argument would also take out the maker of those misstatement well you you be suggest that because b refer specifically to misrepresentation that those misrepresentation do not fall within a or c but i guess to understand that view of the act which be everything prohibits something different you would have to for example think that a and c be mutually exclusive what be the difference between a

2018,United States v. Haymond,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Feigin, you keep talking about the parole cases, but the parole cases are cases that are very different from Justice Breyer's hypothetical because, by definition, in parole, you cannot serve longer than your original sentence. So you never get to the question in the parole cases that Justice Breyer is asking you about, which is whether, once the judge-made finding takes you above the original authorized sentence, it creates an Apprendi problem. Isn't that right? Isn't that the difference between parole cases, is that you can never get into this problem of -- of serving longer than the original authorized sentence? Well, that just incorporates a different argument about how the supervised release is baked into the original sentence. But I'm talking about in normal terms. People think: Oh, this statute authorizes a punishment of up to 10 years. Now what Justice Breyer is saying is now maybe somebody -- it might not be this person -- but somebody is serving 12 years instead because of a judge-made finding. And I would have thought that that's a pretty simple case under Apprendi. I also would have thought it's a pretty simple case under Apprendi if all of a sudden a mandatory minimum pops up as a result of a judge's finding. That's a pretty simple case under Alleyne, which was also a pretty simple case under Apprendi. So you have two problems here. One is a mandatory minimum is suddenly popping up because of a judge-made finding, and one is a longer sentence than originally authorized is suddenly popping up because of a judge-made finding. He's certainly in the situation of the mandatory minimum. You agree with that? Well, but the question is where -- -- where Congress's leeway stops because the Constitution kicks in. And that's what we've talked about in Apprendi and then in Alleyne. And where we've said the Constitution kicks in is that judge-made findings are not good enough to trigger mandatory minimums or to trigger changes in the statutorily authorized range. And both of these -- at least mandatory minimums is present in this case. And the arguments that you're presenting also raise questions about moving the statutory range. And it just seems if this isn't a clear-cut violation of Apprendi and Alleyne, like, what is? A judge here is making a finding -- and not only any old finding, a finding of a statutory violation. And he's made -- a judge, not a jury, by a preponderance rather than by a reasonable doubt, and the result is somebody spends a very significant amount of time in prison. Just to understand what you mean there, yes with regard to Mr. Haymond because Mr. Haymond can't be brought -- he's not going beyond the statutory maximum here? Is that what you mean? So he has -- he has no -- he -- he himself has no claim that the statutory maximum is being stretched? Yes, that's what I said. He has no claim that the statutory maximum is being stretched. So that when you said to Justice Kavanaugh yes with respect to Mr. Haymond, that's why? Mr. Lunn, you're raising a lot of objections, but, I mean, you can't argue with the proposition that such a system would cure the constitutional violation that you're complaining of, isn't that right? The constitutional violation that you're complaining of, the Apprendi/Alleyne constitutional -- -- problem, a jury would cure, is that right? That's what I was -- I think that's right. I think it is what Congress wanted to do. I mean, the -- that question should be thought of much in the way we think of whether to sever unconstitutional provisions as -- as a -- as a question of congressional intent. Which system would Congress rather? Would they want this whole -- would they want this provision severed or would they want the whole statute to fall? Similarly, would they want a jury impaneled or would they want the statute to fall? And how can we think that Congress would not have rather impaneled a jury? It would alter it. It would make it constitutional. (Laughter.)

2018,Herrera v. Wyoming,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Hicks, are -- are you asking us to decide that issue, or are you asking us to remand on that issue? If -- if -- if your primary argument is that it was forfeited, and I think you -- you have some good grounds for thinking that, but given that that is a state law matter, why wouldn't we remand to the Wyoming courts to decide that forfeiture question? So, Mister -- Why do you think Race Horse wasn't over -- overruled? Well, but it does try to distinguish it. Now I have to say I've read that paragraph three times, and I still really have no idea what it's talking about. (Laughter.) But it does try to distinguish it. It has this view that there are two kinds of rights and -- and some are -- two kinds of termination points for a treaty, and some are clearly contemplated and some aren't. What it never tells you is how that distinction relates at all to the statehood question that's before us and that was before Mille Lacs. But -- but it does -- there's something in its head about how these treaties are different and why that matters. And I guess I'm looking to you to tell me what I don't understand about it. But, Mr. Knepper, I -- I think this isn't just any change. I -- I think a fair reading would suggest that what Mille Lacs did was to repudiate the reasoning that Race Horse had in it with respect to exactly the question before us. And it's true that it did not go all the way to overruling the case, but it -- it came up like half a step short of that. It basically said the case was wrong, and then it found some distinction that wasn't even relevant to the question and said we don't have to overrule it because there is this distinction. But all the reasoning is repudiated. Wouldn't you think -- wouldn't you say that that's right? Well, just to make this more concrete, I mean, as I understand it, Race Horse essentially said that these treaty rights expired upon statehood. And Mille Lacs comes in and says that's a wrong thing to say. Treaty rights don't expire upon statehood. So that seems like a pretty relevant change in the law. ",mr hick be be you ask us to decide that issue or be you ask us to remand on that issue if if if your primary argument be that it be forfeit and i think you you have some good ground for think that but give that that be a state law matter why would not we remand to the wyoming court to decide that forfeiture question so mister why do you think race horse be not over overrule well but it do try to distinguish it now i have to say I have read that paragraph three time and i still really have no idea what it be talk about laughter but it do try to distinguish it it have this view that there be two kind of right and and some be two kind of termination point for a treaty and some be clearly contemplate and some be not what it never tell you be how that distinction relate at all to the statehood question that be before us and that be before mille lac but but it do there be something in its head about how these treaty be different and why that matter and i guess I be look to you to tell me what i do not understand about it but mr knepper i i think this be not just any change i i think a fair reading would suggest that what mille lac do be to repudiate the reasoning that race horse have in it with respect to exactly the question before us and it be true that it do not go all the way to overrule the case but it it come up like half a step short of that it basically say the case be wrong and then it find some distinction that be not even relevant to the question and say we do not have to overrule it because there be this distinction but all the reasoning be repudiate would not you think would not you say that that be right well just to make this more concrete i mean as i understand it race horse essentially say that these treaty right expire upon statehood and mille lac come in and say that be a wrong thing to say treaty right do not expire upon statehood so that seem like a pretty relevant change in the law ,122.92000000000002,Case pending,"Jan 8, 2019",Clayvin Herrera,Wyoming,17-532,"Jun 28, 2018",,114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2018,Air and Liquid Systems Corp. v. Devries,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Dvoretzky -- and this follows on Justice Breyer's -- when you say that even when this manufacturer is -- or the Navy or whoever else it is, is directed to use asbestos, you are not liable, are you making a fairness argument? Are you making an efficiency argument? What kind of argument is that? Okay. I mean, we could read the restatement and contest that. So -- so I guess what I'm asking is, like what -- what -- what sense would that rule make? If -- if you think that that's what the doctrine says, tell me why the doctrine says that, because -- because I can't think of a reason, and that makes me think that the doctrine doesn't say it. So here's -- this is your opportunity to tell me what sense would it make to say, even though you direct the use of asbestos, you can't be liable for its harms? But why is that? You've directed it to use asbestos, so they're going to use asbestos. No, but the warning -- -- presumably would say when this product is used with asbestos, it creates the following dangers. So, if 20 years from now the product is not used with asbestos, everybody knows to ignore the warning. But the warning is good for all the time in which the product is used with asbestos. Well, at most, you have two warnings here. You have the equipment warning and the asbestos warning. Does that really -- I would think that that's kind of good. You know, it's two warnings. You take it pretty seriously. One of the horribles that Mr. Dvoretzky threw out at the end of his argument was like a flashlight with batteries. What -- how should that come out? No, you just put the batteries in, a normal flashlight, but it doesn't work. You can turn it on, it doesn't work, unless the batteries are in there. Did you feel overwarned? ",mr dvoretzky and this follow on justice breyer s when you say that even when this manufacturer be or the navy or whoever else it be be direct to use asbestos you be not liable be you make a fairness argument be you make an efficiency argument what kind of argument be that okay i mean we could read the restatement and contest that so so i guess what I be ask be like what what what sense would that rule make if if you think that that be what the doctrine say tell me why the doctrine say that because because i can not think of a reason and that make me think that the doctrine do not say it so here s this be your opportunity to tell me what sense would it make to say even though you direct the use of asbestos you can not be liable for its harm but why be that you have direct it to use asbestos so they be go to use asbestos no but the warning presumably would say when this product be use with asbestos it create the following danger so if year from now the product be not use with asbestos everybody know to ignore the warning but the warning be good for all the time in which the product be use with asbestos well at most you have two warning here you have the equipment warning and the asbestos warning do that really i would think that that be kind of good you know it be two warning you take it pretty seriously one of the horribles that mr dvoretzky throw out at the end of his argument be like a flashlight with battery what how should that come out no you just put the battery in a normal flashlight but it do not work you can turn it on it do not work unless the battery be in there do you feel overwarned ,101.04,Case pending,"Oct 10, 2018","Air and Liquid Systems Corp., et al.","Roberta G.

2018,Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. v. Albrecht,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Dvoretzky, let me give you a -- a -- a hypothetical because I think we can -- could all agree that if you had proposed a warning, let -- let me just say major -- major fractures versus stress fractures, and if you had proposed a warning that dealt with major fractures and the FDA had said no, we don't think that the literature supports that, then there's nothing you can do, and you should be immune from any suit. I think that that's pretty clear. The question is sort of, you know, did -- did you propose a different kind of warning? So let me give you a hypothetical. Suppose that you manufacture a drug and there's some evidence, whether it's enough, hard to know, but there's some evidence that it causes ovarian cancer, and you, the drug manufacturer, proposes a warning to the FDA, but instead of saying that the drug causes ovarian cancer, you say it causes ovarian cysts. Now ovarian cysts are nothing that anybody wants to have, but they're an inconvenience. They're not ovarian cancer. And the FDA says: No, we don't think that that's the issue at all. Does that mean that you're off the hook now with respect to revising your label to say that your product causes ovarian cancer? Okay. So that makes it a much smaller case, right? That we can agree on things on either side. We can agree that if the FDA said to you, you don't have to warn about major fractures, you are off the hook. And on the other hand, we can agree if the FDA rejected a warning that had nothing to do with the thing that was really at risk, you're not off the hook. And then the whole question boils down to what was your proposal, what was their response, were you both talking about the same things? In other words, were you both talking about major risks? Or did the FDA look at your proposal and say they're not talking about major fractures; they're only talking about stress fractures; and there's no reason to think that stress fractures are a real risk and no reason to put that in the label. Yeah, but, you see, that's -- -- that's the reason I asked that question about the ovarian cancer and the ovarian cysts, because I think you could say on a -- on something like that, well, look, it's true that our -- our proposal talked about ovarian cysts, but we gave them all of this data, and if they had really looked at all of the data, they would have seen that it -- it -- there's a real risk of -- of causing ovarian cancer, and the fact that they didn't tell us immediately to change our label means that we're exempt from suit. And I would think that that is not a good understanding of the statute. The idea that they have to look through all of your data, even though you pinpoint an entirely different risk, in order to find out what the real risk is, and -- and that if they don't manage to do that, you're exempt from suit, that seems to me a very counterintuitive reading of the statute and, indeed, not just counterintuitive, it seems to conflict with the -- the statutory provision, the rule of construction that says that manufacturers have primary responsibility over their labels. Well, but your -- the way you answered that question, you said a warning that it understood to be about the relevant risk, and -- and that's really the question. The back and forth about the proposal and about the FDA's reaction to it is whether the FDA understood to be -- the warning to be about major fractures, given that your proposal talked, I think, in six different sentences about stress fractures. Well, but, if I understand the -- if I understand the sort of terminology, and maybe I don't, but insufficiency stress fractures are, you know, essentially, there's a world of things where you can have a traumatic incident that leads to a fracture and then you can have other fractures that are not caused by trauma, right? But the fractures that are not caused by trauma can be small fractures, stress fractures that take care of themselves with rest and elevation, and large fractures, where all of a sudden you're staring at a bone that's popping out the wrong way. So those are really different things. They're both caused by something that's not trauma, but one is an inconvenience and the other is a serious injury. But how are we to understand, Mr. Stewart, like what FDA understands at any given moment? In other words, what are we to look to when we decide whether it's impossible for Merck to change its label? Because one easy way of thinking about whether it's impossible for Merck to change its label is to say: Did the FDA tell Merck that it couldn't change its label in the relevant way? If the FDA told Merck that, then it's impossible. But, if the FDA didn't tell Merck that, whatever is in the FDA's head, if the FDA didn't tell Merck that, then it's not impossible for Merck to change its label, and it has responsibility over its label, and to the extent that it thinks that the literature supports a change, it should change its label. Right. That would have been better, and it would have been enough, right? We wouldn't -- we wouldn't be here? Or maybe we would, but it would be an easy case, Merck would win? But if I -- I -- I take it -- -- Mr. Stewart, you're saying two things. There are sort of two points on a spectrum that you're pretty clear about. One is, if FDA had told them, we just don't think -- we understand that this proposal is about major risks and we don't think that there's enough evidence in the literature to support that, that's -- that's easy, Merck doesn't change its label, and there can't be suit against Merck. On the other hand, suppose that the FDA -- and I -- I -- I understood this to be your point -- suppose that the FDA had said, you know, what's the -- the real problem with your label is that you're talking about stress fractures, and we think that the issue is these major fractures, and that's why we're rejecting it, and we're going to continue to be considering the possibility of major fractures. If the FDA had said that clearly, Merck is not off the hook. Would you agree with that? It -- it doesn't know yet, let's assume. So this is something that it just doesn't know yet. And -- and it's rejecting the letter for another reason. Now you might expect that FDA would continue to work with Merck about the major fractures. You might expect a lot of things. But the only thing that the FDA has told Merck is we don't like this label that you've done about stress fractures because we really think stress fractures are not a problem. Wait, I guess you're changing my -- my -- you know, I meant this to be a hypothetical, where you could assume a hypothetical on both sides, right, where the language was sufficiently clear of what FDA was doing, that it either would or wouldn't take Merck off the hook. My real question for you is suppose we're not at either one of those worlds. Suppose we have an ambiguous letter. Who should decide how to construe it? Well, it's also too narrow. Right. So suppose, Mr. Frederick, that the best reading of what happened here is that the FDA looks at this letter and it says -- this proposal, and it says this is a terrible proposal; whatever the problem is, the problem is not stress fractures and -- and so we're going to reject that. But we do think that there is an issue -- and we don't know the answer to it yet -- we do think that there's an issue about this -- these more major fractures. And -- and you see this because, eventually, they do a task force and they -- and then the task force decides something. So, if the FDA is in that boat, right, where it -- it -- it -- it -- it -- it sends the letter and the letter says what you've said is just inadequate and wrong, but we don't know yet what we're really dealing with and we don't know whether a change in your label is appropriate, and we're going to continue to study that, what should the manufacturer do at that time? Should the manufacturer change the label? So -- so are you saying that you think that the question is, was there official action by the FDA that prevented Merck from changing its label? Is that the test in your view? Is there official action by the FDA that prevented Merck from changing its label? Correct. Okay. So that's what I was assuming. But that's the question. And that's a legal question, is that correct? But a judge can decide that question. ",mr dvoretzky let me give you a a a hypothetical because i think we can could all agree that if you have propose a warning let let me just say major major fracture versus stress fracture and if you have propose a warning that deal with major fracture and the fda have say no we do not think that the literature support that then there be nothing you can do and you should be immune from any suit i think that that be pretty clear the question be sort of you know do do you propose a different kind of warning so let me give you a hypothetical suppose that you manufacture a drug and there be some evidence whether it be enough hard to know but there be some evidence that it cause ovarian cancer and you the drug manufacturer propose a warning to the fda but instead of say that the drug cause ovarian cancer you say it cause ovarian cyst now ovarian cyst be nothing that anybody want to have but they be an inconvenience they be not ovarian cancer and the fda say no we do not think that that be the issue at all do that mean that you be off the hook now with respect to revise your label to say that your product cause ovarian cancer okay so that make it a much small case right that we can agree on thing on either side we can agree that if the fda say to you you do not have to warn about major fracture you be off the hook and on the other hand we can agree if the fda reject a warning that have nothing to do with the thing that be really at risk you be not off the hook and then the whole question boil down to what be your proposal what be their response we be you both talk about the same thing in other word we be you both talk about major risk or do the fda look at your proposal and say they be not talk about major fracture they be only talk about stress fracture and there be no reason to think that stress fracture be a real risk and no reason to put that in the label yeah but you see that be that be the reason i ask that question about the ovarian cancer and the ovarian cyst because i think you could say on a on something like that well look it be true that our our proposal talk about ovarian cyst but we give them all of this data and if they have really look at all of the data they would have see that it it there be a real risk of of cause ovarian cancer and the fact that they do not tell us immediately to change our label mean that we be exempt from suit and i would think that that be not a good understanding of the statute the idea that they have to look through all of your data even though you pinpoint an entirely different risk in order to find out what the real risk be and and that if they do not manage to do that you be exempt from suit that seem to me a very counterintuitive reading of the statute and indeed not just counterintuitive it seem to conflict with the the statutory provision the rule of construction that say that manufacturer have primary responsibility over their label well but your the way you answer that question you say a warning that it understand to be about the relevant risk and and that be really the question the back and forth about the proposal and about the fda s reaction to it be whether the fda understood to be the warning to be about major fracture give that your proposal talk i think in six different sentence about stress fracture well but if i understand the if i understand the sort of terminology and maybe i do not but insufficiency stress fracture be you know essentially there be a world of thing where you can have a traumatic incident that lead to a fracture and then you can have other fracture that be not cause by trauma right but the fracture that be not cause by trauma can be small fracture stress fracture that take care of themselves with rest and elevation and large fracture where all of a sudden you be star at a bone that be pop out the wrong way so those be really different thing they be both cause by something that be not trauma but one be an inconvenience and the other be a serious injury but how be we to understand mr stewart like what fda understands at any give moment in other word what be we to look to when we decide whether it be impossible for merck to change its label because one easy way of think about whether it be impossible for merck to change its label be to say do the fda tell merck that it could not change its label in the relevant way if the fda tell merck that then it be impossible but if the fda do not tell merck that whatever be in the fda s head if the fda do not tell merck that then it be not impossible for merck to change its label and it have responsibility over its label and to the extent that it think that the literature support a change it should change its label right that would have be good and it would have be enough right we would not we would not be here or maybe we would but it would be an easy case merck would win but if i i i take it mr stewart you be say two thing there be sort of two point on a spectrum that you be pretty clear about one be if fda have tell them we just do not think we understand that this proposal be about major risk and we do not think that there be enough evidence in the literature to support that that be that be easy merck do not change its label and there can not be suit against merck on the other hand suppose that the fda and i i i understand this to be your point suppose that the fda have say you know what be the the real problem with your label be that you be talk about stress fracture and we think that the issue be these major fracture and that be why we be reject it and we be go to continue to be consider the possibility of major fracture if the fda have say that clearly merck be not off the hook would you agree with that it it do not know yet let us assume so this be something that it just do not know yet and and it be reject the letter for another reason now you might expect that fda would continue to work with merck about the major fracture you might expect a lot of thing but the only thing that the fda have tell merck be we do not like this label that you have do about stress fracture because we really think stress fracture be not a problem wait i guess you be change my my you know i mean this to be a hypothetical where you could assume a hypothetical on both side right where the language be sufficiently clear of what fda be do that it either would or would not take merck off the hook my real question for you be suppose we be not at either one of those world suppose we have an ambiguous letter who should decide how to construe it well it be also too narrow right so suppose mr frederick that the best reading of what happen here be that the fda look at this letter and it say this proposal and it say this be a terrible proposal whatever the problem be the problem be not stress fracture and and so we be go to reject that but we do think that there be an issue and we do not know the answer to it yet we do think that there be an issue about this these more major fracture and and you see this because eventually they do a task force and they and then the task force decide something so if the fda be in that boat right where it it it it it it send the letter and the letter say what you have say be just inadequate and wrong but we do not know yet what we be really deal with and we do not know whether a change in your label be appropriate and we be go to continue to study that what should the manufacturer do at that time should the manufacturer change the label so so be you say that you think that the question be be there official action by the fda that prevent merck from change its label be that the test in your view be there official action by the fda that prevent merck from change its label correct okay so that be what i be assume but that be the question and that be a legal question be that correct but a judge can decide that question ,531.7600000000003,Case pending,"Jan 7, 2019",Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp.,"Doris

2018,Dawson v. Steager,114,Elena Kagan,"But an antidiscrimination provision doesn't necessarily require a most favored nation clause. And as I understand your answers to Justices Kavanaugh and Alito, you're saying there's a most favored nation requirement. What difference does that make? I mean, let's assume a situation where the State says state employees who are in one of these four plans, and let's further assume that everybody in those four plans receives a lesser benefit or, alternatively, contributes a greater percentage of their salary to the plan. So, you know, it's -- it's -- it's -- the State has just decided, look, this is a convenient way of identifying these people, but, in fact, all the people in these plans have that characteristic, which makes them different from the federal employees, that they contribute more or that they receive less in other benefits. Well, I guess my hypothetical was meant to take that off the table. To say assuming that that's not true -- -- and the State really has categorized precisely as -- as to benefit levels or contribution levels but not in those terms, you're -- you know, not in those terms, and you're saying that in itself is impermissible? If that's the problem, why were you suggesting that we remand this? It would just seem as though we should decide it if that's the problem. I -- I guess what I don't -- But I guess what I -- I don't understand about -- about what you think ought to be left open on remand is, if you think that the prime evil of this legislation is that it's not facially neutral, that a federal employee can't be a part of these state plans, so could never be treated in the same way, then all the State justifications like these people get fewer benefits, these people pay more in -- in -- in -- make more of a contribution, all of that, do I understand your position correctly, is just irrelevant? The -- you know, the -- the state court could find that these people get less benefits and that these people, the state employees, make a greater contribution, and -- and yet not be able to rule for the State. Is that correct? No, but even if he is in the favored class, you're saying he's not -- no, I -- I -- okay, I get it. I get it. Could you -- Well, what -- what could -- what could -- this is going to the exact same thing. What could West Virginia say on a remand and what could the West Virginia court find on a remand in -- in -- in defense of a decision for West Virginia? Like, how would that opinion read, a pro West Virginia opinion on remand? Oh, well, that's -- that was exactly my hypothetical. And your friend answered it the other way. And I -- I -- I thought that he answered it the other way because he said, even if they drew the line in exactly that way, the problem with this statute is that the federal employees can't get into the state plans. It's this benefits and contributions? Well, we can't possibly -- I'm sorry. So if I understand what you -- what you're saying, I think you suggested three characteristics of the members of these plans, and one is that they receive low benefits. Another is that they contribute a very substantial portion of their earnings to the plan. And the third, which I'm not sure I understand, but your third is that the plan itself is made up only of law enforcement officers. Is that correct? Now it seems to me that we couldn't possibly do anything -- suppose -- even if you were right, that -- that if the State showed all of that, I mean, we're not in a position to rule in your favor here. At the very most, you're entitled to -- or at the very most, what we should do is remand so that the state court could figure out whether, in fact, the members of this state plan, as compared to federal employees, receive lower benefits, make higher contributions, and are similarly in a -- you know, and -- and -- and don't share this characteristic of a law-enforcement-only plan? So that is very interesting because -- What -- what -- what strikes me about the way this argument has gone, it's a little bit unexpected for me, is that you and the SG actually agree. Because you think that the states should be able to prove that the members of this plan are different from federal employees, notwithstanding that the State has made a non-neutral distinction. And, on the contrary, LAWRENCE D. ROSENBERG thinks the fact that the State has made a non-neutral facial distinction is game over. ",but an antidiscrimination provision do not necessarily require a most favored nation clause and as i understand your answer to justice kavanaugh and alito you be say there be a most favored nation requirement what difference do that make i mean let us assume a situation where the state say state employee who be in one of these four plan and let us further assume that everybody in those four plan receive a less benefit or alternatively contribute a great percentage of their salary to the plan so you know it be it be it be the state have just decide look this be a convenient way of identify these people but in fact all the people in these plan have that characteristic which make them different from the federal employee that they contribute more or that they receive less in other benefit well i guess my hypothetical be mean to take that off the table to say assume that that be not true and the state really have categorize precisely as as to benefit level or contribution level but not in those term you be you know not in those term and you be say that in itself be impermissible if that be the problem why we be you suggest that we remand this it would just seem as though we should decide it if that be the problem i i guess what i do not but i guess what i i do not understand about about what you think ought to be leave open on remand be if you think that the prime evil of this legislation be that it be not facially neutral that a federal employee can not be a part of these state plan so could never be treat in the same way then all the state justification like these people get few benefit these people pay more in in in make more of a contribution all of that do i understand your position correctly be just irrelevant the you know the the state court could find that these people get less benefit and that these people the state employee make a great contribution and and yet not be able to rule for the state be that correct no but even if he be in the favored class you be say he be not no i i okay i get it i get it could you well what what could what could this be go to the exact same thing what could west virginia say on a remand and what could the west virginia court find on a remand in in in defense of a decision for west virginia like how would that opinion read a pro west virginia opinion on remand oh well that be that be exactly my hypothetical and your friend answer it the other way and i i i think that he answer it the other way because he say even if they draw the line in exactly that way the problem with this statute be that the federal employee can not get into the state plan it be this benefit and contribution well we can not possibly I be sorry so if i understand what you what you be say i think you suggest three characteristic of the member of these plan and one be that they receive low benefit another be that they contribute a very substantial portion of their earnings to the plan and the third which I be not sure i understand but your third be that the plan itself be make up only of law enforcement officer be that correct now it seem to me that we could not possibly do anything suppose even if you we be right that that if the state show all of that i mean we be not in a position to rule in your favor here at the very most you be entitle to or at the very most what we should do be remand so that the state court could figure out whether in fact the member of this state plan as compare to federal employee receive low benefit make high contribution and be similarly in a you know and and and do not share this characteristic of a law enforcement only plan so that be very interesting because what what what strike me about the way this argument have go it be a little bit unexpected for me be that you and the sg actually agree because you think that the state should be able to prove that the member of this plan be different from federal employee notwithstanding that the state have make a non neutral distinction and on the contrary lawrence d rosenberg think the fact that the state have make a non neutral facial distinction be game over ,285.9600000000001,Roberts Court,"Dec 3, 2018","James Dawson, et ux.","Dale W.

2018,Nutraceutical Corp. v. Lambert,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Hueston, given the reasons that you just stated for that rule, why is the rule limited to a motion for reconsideration that's filed during the 14-day window? In other words, suppose the motion for reconsideration was filed in a timely manner for such a motion but after the 14-day period. Why wouldn't the same reasons apply? It just seems as though the -- the exception that you admit, which is the exception for filing a motion for reconsideration within the 14-day period, also effectively renders that 14-day period a nullity, right, because it stops it in its tracks and then, once the motion for reconsideration has been dealt with, as I understand the agreement between the parties, the -- the clock goes all the way back to the beginning. So given that -- that what you -- the exception you admit renders the 14-day period a nullity, again, I just wonder why the exact same reasons, practices, traditions don't suggest that, for example, as in -- as -- as what -- the example you gave, if the motion for reconsideration is timely filed within 30 days, that as long as you do that, it should have the same effect. Well, Mr. Hueston, you can't please everyone here. (Laughter.) I think you're going to have to choose between nothing, no time, never, and, sure, you can reserve some -- the possibility of an equitable exception in circumstances that are different from the ones here. So which is it? What -- what did you understand the district court to be saying when it set the motion for reconsideration? What -- what was -- what were the -- what's the -- what did it tell you about timing deadlines? And what did you infer from what it said? The district court, though, didn't say anything about a time for appeal, is that correct? And why doesn't that matter? Yeah, Mr. Herstoff, I don't think this is your fault, right? This is the court's fault in -- in putting a bad label on something that it actually meant when it meant -- meant something else. But my understanding of what the court has meant when it's done this is not the attack from Mars or Hurricane Katrina. My understanding is that it was meant to label a category of cases where the court had misled the party into doing something, into missing some kind of deadline. Is that your understanding? So -- but -- but I don't see where that is here. Yes. So he said a reconsideration motion could be filed. He was right about that. A reconsideration motion could have been filed. What he didn't say anything about was -- was -- was what that meant for your appeal right. But can -- You know, I suppose I'm with you that it makes more sense to do the motion for reconsideration before the appeal and that that is true even when the appeal is interlocutory, but, you know, not every rule we have makes perfect sense. And it just doesn't seem as though you're off the hook from actually looking up the rules and saying, well, look, this says 14 days. I better file this appeal within 14 days, or at least ask some further questions about it, just because it sort of seems to make sense to do a motion for reconsideration before an appeal. ",mr hueston give the reason that you just state for that rule why be the rule limit to a motion for reconsideration that be file during the day window in other word suppose the motion for reconsideration be file in a timely manner for such a motion but after the day period why would not the same reason apply it just seem as though the the exception that you admit which be the exception for file a motion for reconsideration within the day period also effectively render that day period a nullity right because it stop it in its track and then once the motion for reconsideration have be deal with as i understand the agreement between the party the the clock go all the way back to the beginning so give that that what you the exception you admit render the day period a nullity again i just wonder why the exact same reason practice tradition do not suggest that for example as in as as what the example you give if the motion for reconsideration be timely file within day that as long as you do that it should have the same effect well mr hueston you can not please everyone here laughter i think you be go to have to choose between nothing no time never and sure you can reserve some the possibility of an equitable exception in circumstance that be different from the one here so which be it what what do you understand the district court to be say when it set the motion for reconsideration what what be what we be the what be the what do it tell you about time deadline and what do you infer from what it say the district court though do not say anything about a time for appeal be that correct and why do not that matter yeah mr herstoff i do not think this be your fault right this be the court s fault in in put a bad label on something that it actually mean when it mean meant something else but my understanding of what the court have mean when it be do this be not the attack from mar or hurricane katrina my understanding be that it be mean to label a category of case where the court have mislead the party into do something into miss some kind of deadline be that your understanding so but but i do not see where that be here yes so he say a reconsideration motion could be file he be right about that a reconsideration motion could have be file what he do not say anything about be be be what that meant for your appeal right but can you know i suppose I be with you that it make more sense to do the motion for reconsideration before the appeal and that that be true even when the appeal be interlocutory but you know not every rule we have make perfect sense and it just do not seem as though you be off the hook from actually look up the rule and say well look this say day i well file this appeal within day or at least ask some further question about it just because it sort of seem to make sense to do a motion for reconsideration before an appeal ,199.9,Roberts Court,"Nov 27, 2018",Nutraceutical Corporation,Troy Lambert,17-1094,"Jun 25, 2018","Feb 26, 2019",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

It seems to present real opportunities for gamesmanship as well, sort of bad incentives for a state. Just cover over your purpose? May -- -- may -- may I go back to Justice Gorsuch's question -- -- about PG&E and whether it's the same as or different from this case? And it seems -- this might be just a different way of saying what he said, but it does seem to me that when you're talking about construction of a nuclear plant, there's obvious dual authority between the federal government and the states. 2018 gives a lot of authority to the states, and then 2021(c) clearly makes this a part of what the Commission looks at. And, you know, Mr. Cooper said there's the whether question and the how question. But, honestly, if you think about the thing, there -- there's dual authority in one area, and it seems to me that that's not true here, where the Act specifically says that the Commission's authority starts when the -- -- with what happens prior to that. So isn't the separation involved in these two activities very different from the separation involved in the PG&E context? But a problem -- Well, General, you -- you've been talking about the undermining of this industry, but I guess a couple of things is, one is that as long as there is this other purpose or as long as the state can say that there's this other purpose, it will just as successfully be able to undermine the industry. And then on the -- on the -- as well, this statute does give the federal government the ability to make sure that states can't really undermine it if the federal government wants a nuclear industry badly enough, because, in addition to the fact that somebody can import this material from another state or from another country, the federal government itself can mine for this material on its own lands, or it can condemn lands and -- and do it with newly acquired lands. So there's a limit to how far any state is able to undermine the federal goal here if the federal goal is real enough. And that's also why Skull Valley is right? Well, why did you even do that? Why is this a factual allegation? Suppose -- But, of course, Mr. Heytens, not for reasons having to do with radiological safety. And I suppose one way to understand this -- the preemptive field here is that it surely extends to various kinds of activities, and this is not one of those activities, the mining. But, in addition, it extends to judgments about radiological safety, even outside those activities, on the theory that the NRC is the proper body to make judgments about radiological safety and we don't want 50 states to be making their own. So I suppose that's a -- a way to explain the opposite position.

2018,Manhattan Community Access Corp. v. Halleck,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. De Leeuw -- Mr. De Leeuw, what would you think is the right result if you had the obligation that you think you don't have? In other words, just assume for the moment that you did have to follow a first-come, first-served rule and that you didn't have the discretion that you think you have over programming. What would then the right answer be? Well, I guess I'm going back to Justice Ginsburg's question. On the assumption that you don't have discretion, that you have to follow a first-come, first-served rule, I think that Justice Ginsburg asked why doesn't that essentially make you -- you -- you've been designated by the city to administer a public forum. So you would say it's because you're private? Yeah. So -- but -- but I think the city thinks that it has a property right here. It has -- you know, it's a property right that comes from a contract where the city has reserved for itself the ability to decide what programming should be. Well, you can talk about it as an easement or you can just talk about it as a contract right, but -- but these cable operators would not be able to function unless the government had given them these public rights-of-way. And in exchange for giving them these public rights-of-way, the government says: Well, we're going to take certain stations and we're going to decide what the programming for those stations will be. And, you know, given that the whole thing doesn't get off the ground unless the government gives the cable operators the rights-of-way and that it -- it exacts a quid pro quo for that, why isn't there, call it what you want, a property right coming from a contract or an easement or whatever? What is the difference between Justice Alito's hypothetical? Well, let's say that the city has decided we want a public theater. And so it creates a public theater. It decides it wants to use a first-come, first-served system. It decides it doesn't want to do the scheduling itself, so it hires somebody to administer the public theater under the rules that it should all be first-come, first-served. Would -- would that administer be a -- a state actor? Right. So that could be one point of distinction -- -- is, is it property, and then we're back to the question that we started with. But put that aside for a moment. Well, the government says we set the rules about how this is going to operate. We decided we wanted a theater. We decided we wanted first-come, first-served. All we're asking you to do is, you know, we don't have an extra employee to administer this program, so we're contracting that function out. But what makes that person then the independent actor as opposed to the person who's essentially doing everything that the government would do, except that the government thinks it's more efficient to hire somebody else? Does -- -- does your position depend on our finding a governmental property interest and, if so, what is the interest? Where -- where's the line that -- that you think -- I mean, what you said, essentially, is the -- the administrator has no discretion. But suppose the city gave the administrator some discretion. Where -- where's the -- where's the appropriate line? I mean, suppose the -- the city -- suppose it weren't a complete public forum. Suppose there were subject matter limitations. Suppose that the -- the city gave the administrator some discretion to decide within particular areas which programs were better than other programs. Where is the line that this starts becoming not a public forum in your view? I think the question, Mr. Hughes, is what property interest does the government have? And it obtained that interest when it gave the rights-of-way to the cable operator, is that right? What it took back or what it reserved for itself was a property interest in these public access channels? So what you're saying is this is not just a lot of regulation. This is a property interest that the city reserved for itself when it gave over the rights-of-way that the cable company needs to do anything? What gives you the property interest is that you've given over the rights-of-way and you've kept access to -- to -- you've kept the rights to determine how to use public access channels. And you can do that yourself or you can use an administrator. Is that correct? ",mr de leeuw mr de leeuw what would you think be the right result if you have the obligation that you think you do not have in other word just assume for the moment that you do have to follow a first come first serve rule and that you do not have the discretion that you think you have over programming what would then the right answer be well i guess I be go back to justice ginsburg s question on the assumption that you do not have discretion that you have to follow a first come first serve rule i think that justice ginsburg ask why do not that essentially make you you you have be designate by the city to administer a public forum so you would say it be because you be private yeah so but but i think the city think that it have a property right here it have you know it be a property right that come from a contract where the city have reserve for itself the ability to decide what programming should be well you can talk about it as an easement or you can just talk about it as a contract right but but these cable operator would not be able to function unless the government have give them these public right of way and in exchange for give them these public right of way the government say well we be go to take certain station and we be go to decide what the programming for those station will be and you know give that the whole thing do not get off the ground unless the government give the cable operator the right of way and that it it exact a quid pro quo for that why be not there call it what you want a property right come from a contract or an easement or whatever what be the difference between justice alito s hypothetical well let us say that the city have decide we want a public theater and so it create a public theater it decide it want to use a first come first serve system it decide it do not want to do the schedule itself so it hire somebody to administer the public theater under the rule that it should all be first come first serve would would that administer be a a state actor right so that could be one point of distinction be be it property and then we be back to the question that we start with but put that aside for a moment well the government say we set the rule about how this be go to operate we decide we want a theater we decide we want first come first serve all we be ask you to do be you know we do not have an extra employee to administer this program so we be contract that function out but what make that person then the independent actor as oppose to the person who be essentially do everything that the government would do except that the government think it be more efficient to hire somebody else do do your position depend on our find a governmental property interest and if so what be the interest where where be the line that that you think i mean what you say essentially be the the administrator have no discretion but suppose the city give the administrator some discretion where where be the where be the appropriate line i mean suppose the the city suppose it be not a complete public forum suppose there we be subject matter limitation suppose that the the city give the administrator some discretion to decide within particular area which program we be good than other program where be the line that this start become not a public forum in your view i think the question mr hughes be what property interest do the government have and it obtain that interest when it give the right of way to the cable operator be that right what it take back or what it reserve for itself be a property interest in these public access channel so what you be say be this be not just a lot of regulation this be a property interest that the city reserve for itself when it give over the right of way that the cable company need to do anything what give you the property interest be that you have give over the right of way and you have keep access to to you have keep the right to determine how to use public access channel and you can do that yourself or you can use an administrator be that correct ,266.42,Case pending,"Feb 25, 2019","Manhattan Community Access Corporation, et al.","Deedee Halleck, et al.",17-1702,"Oct 12, 2018",,114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2018,Nielsen v. Preap,114,Elena Kagan,"So, Mr. Tripp -- -- just to think about how these two provisions interact with each other, I'm wondering if you can tell me with respect to a group of people who are not involved here. As I understand it, these (A) through (D) categories include some people who have never been in criminal custody at all. So let's take spouses or children of terrorists. But there are a number of categories of people who have never been in custody at all. So they fit within this (A) through (D) category. I'm wondering where you think the authority to detain them comes from. Does the authority to detain them come from (c) or does it come from (a)? I guess I'm not -- I'm not -- Well, it sort of matters to me, I think. You know, you could be saying, if I -- if I understand your -- your view of described in paragraph (1), these aliens are described in paragraph (1) even though they've never been in criminal custody. So that would suggest that (c)(1) is authorizing their detention, and that's what you're saying? Yes. How are you arresting these people? Are you arresting them under (c)(1)? Well, when you say you're arresting them under both, are you saying that with respect to everybody under (c)(1), you're also arresting -- -- them under (a)? Okay. So that I'm not interested in. You know, that kind of -- you're saying that those people are under (c)(1) to the same extent as people who have been in criminal custody? So that seems odd to me because (c)(1) seems to me all about people who have been in criminal custody. Now you have this question about how about if there's a gap between the criminal custody, but -- but -- but your interpretation necessitates that you understand even people who have never been in criminal custody as part of the (c)(1) group. You know -- -- yes, this is -- this is a small group relatively, but it's definitely a group. There are quite a number of subcategories that have never been in criminal custody here, and we could go over what they are if anybody's interested, but there are a number. And -- and -- and your statutory interpretation, particularly your narrow view of the term described in paragraph (1), requires that those people be understood as within the (c)(1) custody authority, and, I don't know, I look at the (c)(1) custody authority and it's all about criminal custody and what happens when you're released from criminal custody, and that makes me think that your interpretation of the words described in paragraph (1) is wrong. Do you have any sense, understanding, even estimate of the -- in the whole class, how many people are people who were detained a day later? How many people were -- you know, were detained a year plus later? But are you saying -- -- but are you saying, Mr. Tripp, that there's no constitutional claim as to any of these people, even if a person has been out for 15 years, has established ties in the community? Are you saying that there's no constitutional problem with that? Right. Well, that's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. I mean, assume that this class were made up of people who hadn't -- who had lived after release from criminal custody for a very substantial period of time, whatever it is, five years, 10 years, 15 years. Would they have constitutional -- serious constitutional claims in your view? And -- and do you agree that an alien could bring that challenge, notwithstanding 1226(e)? So 1226(e), right, is -- is -- is the jurisdictional provision. Does that at all prevent an alien from bringing the kind of challenge that Justice Alito is talking about? In -- in your -- In your class, how many people have been -- what percentage of the class has been out for, let's say -- let's just call it a year plus? What -- what -- what was the answer on that case? In -- in that class?

2018,Stokeling v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"Ms. Bryn, I wonder if you could say a bit more about this reasonable expectation standard, because I'm not sure it does all that much that's different from what the government's standard does. I mean, if you take something like grabbing money out of a hand and say could that reasonably be expected to cause pain or injury, well, maybe some injury, maybe a bruise, maybe a little scratch, maybe a little cut. And, similarly, even a pinch. I mean, reasonably expected to cause pain? Sure, for a while, for a moment. So how does your standard really help to distinguish the kinds of cases that you want to distinguish? But my question wasn't that. It wasn't the eggshell plaintiff. It was the ordinary person who can reasonably be expected to suffer some, even if minimal, pain or injury, the pain that a pinch causes or the injury that comes from your hand being bruised when somebody tries to grab some cash out of it. And I guess I was -- I was confused that you wanted to use this standard, ""reasonably be expected to cause pain or injury,"" because it does seem to me as though a lot of minor activity could -- could satisfy that standard. Well, how many states do you think -- -- how many states do you think will be knocked out? Because, I mean, Florida seems as though it's out of luck because both -- it can't pick up under armed robbery what it loses under unarmed robbery for the reason that you said earlier. Presumably, there are other states in which armed robbery would count as -- as a -- as -- as under the -- this clause. So how many states do you think are going to be in Florida's position that none of their robbery statutes count under this clause? Four or less? Why is that? Well, even if the statute on its face includes that kind of conduct? The majority agreed with that point. Mr. -- Mr. Liu, could I just ask what you understand the Florida cases to be saying? So I'll give you a hypo to elucidate that. So I'm walking down the street and I'm carrying a handbag with a strap over my shoulder, and, as everybody knows, the way you carry that is you essentially grab on to the strap. So -- and then somebody comes and runs and wrests it out of my grasp. Does that count under Florida law as robbery? No, I want -- well, you can illustrate it, sure -- -- but, I mean, I want an answer to my hypothetical. Yeah, so -- -- I was actually taking that out, because, you know, I'm -- I'm -- I'm holding on to the bag, so you're going to need some force to get it. But -- and -- and that kind of force is used. Robbery? Okay. Well, then robbery in Florida really includes pretty much the full gamut of bag snatchings. Right. All I was saying, I mean, I'm sure you can find me a couple of cases where people walk around with cameras or bags and -- and don't have their hands on them. But I'm going to say, as every woman who carries around handbags knows, that's just the normal way you carry around a handbag. So -- so -- so that would be the usual case, maybe not the always case, but it's the usual case of bag snatching that you say falls under the robbery definition. Yeah, I mean -- I'm sorry. Mr. Liu, could I ask before you do that, you keep referring to the common law, but I had thought that the whole structure of the Curtis Johnson opinion is to say, well, we have this common law definition, but it's in the context of a statute which is trying to identify violent felonies. And in that particular context, Justice Scalia said we're going to ignore the common law definition and, instead, use an ordinary language definition of what ""force"" is. And he basically says physical force in the context of a statute that is trying to define violent felonies is violent force, substantial force, and so forth. So why -- why is this common law argument relevant at all? It didn't reference it. The whole argument -- the whole decision was based on that. I guess the ordinary English view is something like, look, when I'm walking down the street and somebody puts a -- a gun in the air and says give me your money, that I know, I understand to be a violent offense. But, when I'm walking down the street and somebody grabs my handbag, I'm not happy about that, but it's -- it just doesn't have that violent aspect of it in ordinary language that I think, you know, beating somebody up does, putting a gun in their face does. And this is a -- a state that defines robbery so broadly that you tell me it basically includes every bag snatcher. But what is the ""this"" that Congress thought? I mean, in all of these cases, we have to look to whether the state has defined its crime more broadly than the basic offense. Could -- force capable of causing physical pain or injury, I mean, it touches capable of causing physical pain or injury when done in the wrong context. I'm standing at the top of a stairs, somebody startles me by putting his hand on my shoulder, I fall down the stairs, I break my leg, that's capable of causing physical pain and injury, it just caused physical pain and injury. So why doesn't your test -- why isn't it defeated even by the holding of Curtis Johnson, the -- the particular application of Curtis Johnson? Why does burglary end up as an enumerated crime and robbery does not when Congress changed the Act? When you say ""knocked out,"" do you mean everything is knocked out or only the basic robbery offense is knocked out, but that leaves aggravated robbery offenses? I guess, Mr. Liu, the problem I'm having in a nutshell is you keep on referring to this as a physical struggle over property, but at the same time, you tell me that if somebody snatches a bag off my shoulder, it's -- it counts as robbery -- -- under Florida law. And, to me, that is not a physical struggle over property. And if a state defines its robbery statute that broadly so as to include, you know, thefts of property but that are not done with physical contestation, physical struggle, then the state has made a choice. But I go back to what your answers to my first questions were. I'm carrying my bag with my hand over the strap, and you say when somebody wrests the bag from me, that's -- that that's robbery. And I say that's every bag snatching in America, save a few. ",ms bryn i wonder if you could say a bit more about this reasonable expectation standard because I be not sure it do all that much that be different from what the government s standard do i mean if you take something like grab money out of a hand and say could that reasonably be expect to because pain or injury well maybe some injury maybe a bruise maybe a little scratch maybe a little cut and

2018,Weyerhaeuser Company v. United States Fish and Wildlife Service,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Bishop, may -- may I offer you a hypothetical just to understand the scope of your argument, which is a bit unclear to me? So, in my hypothetical, there is a species which, like this one, is in only a single habitat, and for whatever reason, that habitat is no longer going to support the species. Disease has come, a predator has come, it's gotten too hot, it's gotten too cold, whatever it is. That single habitat no longer will be able to support the species. And there is no habitat that at the present moment -- there is no other habitat that at the present moment is capable of conserving the species over the long term. But there is a habitat that, with only slight improvements, what the government calls reasonable efforts, can support the species. Okay? So habitat A where the species is, no longer any good. Habitat B, it can't -- it won't conserve the species if left just as it is, but it only takes reasonable effort to conserve the species. Can the government designate that area as unoccupied, critical habitat? I understand that you think -- -- that it's much more than reasonable changes that would be involved here. But I'm -- in my hypothetical, that's why it's a hypothetical, I'm -- -- I'm stipulating -- -- that it's -- it's pretty minimal stuff. It's, you know, dig -- dig a few holes, plant a few trees, that sort of thing.

And why is that? Where in the statute do you find that? But we know that habitat -- -- doesn't mean -- excuse me, I'm sorry. We know that habitat doesn't mean just where a species lives. I mean, that's -- that would be the common understanding of the word ""habitat,"" but this statute clearly goes beyond that, and we know because it says -- it's also where a statute -- where a species could live, right? It's out -- there are also habitats that are outside the geographical area occupied by the species. So we know that the statute is not using the kind of garden-variety definition of habitat. If I could go back to the -- the statutory basis for your position, because, to my mind, it is a counterintuitive result that the statute would prefer extinction of the species to the designation of an area which requires only certain reasonable improvements in order to support the species. That seems a counterintuitive result, and, as I say, it does not seem a result that's demanded at all by the statutory language, which contemplates that habitats will exist even beyond the areas where a species currently resides. But I think that that was dealing with a very different problem. That was dealing with a problem where a species can reside in many areas outside of the area where it resided, and the statute was making clear that just because that's true, you can't go designate all of those areas habitat. But this is a different problem from the problem that we're talking about where there's only a single area that might conceivably prevent extinction of the species. And you're saying that, notwithstanding that it was -- it's only reasonable efforts that would allow it to conserve the species, that's not permitted. But -- but I guess what strikes me about the statute, Mr. Bishop, is that really all over the place you get these references to the fact that habitat isn't just sort of there and perfect always, that habitat requires things to be done to it. You know, even in the definition of ""occupied critical habitat,"" it talks about special management that needs to be taken in order to protect the habitat. And, similarly, in the definition of ""conservation,"" it talks about, you know, the need for habitat improvement. So -- so all through the statute there's this idea of it's not just an on/off switch, that there is habitat that needs to be maintained, improved, and so forth in order to fulfill the function of preserving a species. Well, it is a ""may/if."" But if the other conditions are met, it indicates, because of the use of the ""may,"" rather than the use of a ""shall,"" doesn't it, that the Secretary still has discretion? In other words, if the conditions aren't met, then the Secretary can't exclude. But if the conditions are met, the Secretary may exclude if he wants. Mr. Kneedler -- Mister -- -- Mr. Kneedler, suppose -- if we could just go back to Justice Alito's question, Justice Alito suggested that there were other things that the government is capable of doing to conserve these frogs. So what, consistent with Mr. Bishop's view of the statute, could the government do, is the government enabled to do, that would effectively conserve these frogs? Is there anything? And -- and this -- this statute presumes that the designation of critical habitat is often, almost always, going to be on private land, isn't that correct? Maybe I'll take down ""almost always."" Often. I guess what I was suggesting was -- was -- you know, Congress could have passed a statute which just said every time that there's a problem of this kind, the federal government has to purchase the land that will support an endangered species. It didn't pass that statute. It passed a statute that said that the Secretary could designate critical habitat regardless whether that habitat was on private or public land. And then the question is, where does this requirement of immediacy come from that Mr. Bishop wants to impose? You know, that it has to be -- that it has to be available to support the species exactly now without any further effort? ",mr bishop may may i offer you a hypothetical just to understand the scope of your argument which be a bit unclear to me so in my hypothetical there be a specie which like this one be in only a single habitat and for whatever reason that habitat be no longer go to support the specie disease have come a predator have come it be get too hot it have get too cold whatever it be that single habitat no longer will be able to support the specie and there be no habitat that at the present moment there be no other habitat that at the present moment be capable of conserve the specie over the long term but there be a habitat that with only slight improvement what the government call reasonable effort can support the specie okay so habitat a where the specie be no longer any good habitat b it can not it will not conserve the specie if leave just as it be but it only take reasonable effort to conserve the specie can the government designate that area as unoccupied critical habitat i understand that you think that it be much more than reasonable change that would be involve here but I be in my hypothetical that be why it be a hypothetical I be I be stipulate that it be it be pretty minimal stuff it be you know dig dig a few hole plant a few tree that sort of thing but i want to i want to stick to my hypothetical which be you know maybe something more than de minimis but but but what what the government view as reasonable change such to allow the land to support the specie over the long term and why be that where in the statute do you find that but we know that habitat do not mean excuse me I be sorry we know that habitat do not mean just where a specie live i mean that be that would be the common understanding of the word habitat but this statute clearly go beyond that and we know because it say it be also where a statute where a specie could live right it be out there be also habitat that be outside the geographical area occupy by the specie so we know that the statute be not use the kind of garden variety definition of habitat if i could go back to the the statutory basis for your position because to my mind it be a counterintuitive result that the statute would prefer extinction of the specie to the designation of an area which require only certain reasonable improvement in order to support the specie that seem a counterintuitive result and as i say it do not seem a result that be demand at all by the statutory language which contemplate that habitat will exist even beyond the area where a specie currently resides but i think that that be deal with a very different problem that be deal with a problem where a specie can reside in many area outside of the area where it reside and the statute be make clear that just because that be true you can not go designate all of those area habitat but this be a different problem from the problem that we be talk about where there be only a single area that might conceivably prevent extinction of the specie and you be say that notwithstanding that it be it be only reasonable effort that would allow it to conserve the specie that be not permit but but i guess what strike me about the statute mr bishop be that really all over the place you get these reference to the fact that habitat be not just sort of there and perfect always that habitat require thing to be do to it you know even in the definition of occupied critical habitat it talk about special management that need to be take in order to protect the habitat and similarly in the definition of conservation it talk about you know the need for habitat improvement so so all through the statute there be this idea of it be not just an onoff switch that there be habitat that need to be maintain improve and so forth in order to fulfill the function of preserve a specie well it be a mayif but if the other condition be meet it indicate because of the use of the may rather than the use of a shall do not it that the secretary still have discretion in other word if the condition be not meet then the secretary can not exclude but if the condition be meet the secretary may exclude if he want mr kneedler mister mr kneedler suppose if we could just go back to justice alito s question justice alito suggest that there we be other thing that the government be capable of do to conserve these frog so what consistent with mr bishop s view of the statute could the government do be the government enable to do that would effectively conserve these frog be there anything and and this this statute presume that the designation of critical habitat be often almost always go to be on private land be not that correct maybe I will take down almost always often i guess what i be suggest be be you know congress could have pass a statute which just say every time that there be a problem of this kind the federal government have to purchase the land that will support an endanger specie it do not pass that statute it pass a statute that say that the secretary could designate critical habitat regardless whether that habitat be on private or public land and then the question be where do this requirement of immediacy come from that mr bishop want to impose you know that it have to be that it have to be available to support the specie exactly now without any further effort ,376.72000000000014,Roberts Court,"Oct 1, 2018",Weyerhaeuser

2018,Gamble v. United States,114,Elena Kagan,"But -- -- but, Mr. Chaiten, I think -- -- I think the point is that you're asking us to write an opinion which is based on this original understanding, and the original understanding, as you put it, applies between foreign countries, and, a fortiori, it must be that our decision would apply between foreign countries. And that's what -- That's -- that's -- that's what your brief is all about. That's what you're asking us to say, that the original understanding was that there would be no double jeopardy bar between different sovereigns when those sovereigns are foreign countries. So how could we avoid that consequence? Well, can I ask you a different -- Could you say a little bit more about why you think incorporation or the lack of incorporation had anything to do with this question? I mean, there is that reference in Fox, but it honestly makes no sense that incorporation would be the basis of the doctrine, because, if incorporation were the basis of the doctrine, you would have a doctrine that only cuts one way. In other words, it would -- it would -- the Court would have held that the federal government can't prosecute an individual for the same offense after a state prosecution, but not the other way around. So the fact that there's not a one-way ratchet but that, in fact, it's a symmetrical rule suggests that incorporation has nothing to do with it at all. I -- I guess what strikes me, Mr. Chaiten, is that you can say, well, you know, this case was a little bit different. In this case, the arguments weren't properly presented. In this case, there's something else that's the matter. But, you know, this is an 170-year-old rule, and it's an 170-year-old rule that's been relied on by close on 30 Justices have voted at one time or another specifically for this rule, not an application of this -- but for this rule. And, you know, part of what stare decisis is, is a kind of doctrine of humility where we say we are really uncomfortable throwing over 170-year-old rules that 30 Justices have approved just because we think we can kind of do it better. But, Mr. Chaiten, I mean, one of the -- I'm sorry. Please. Well, I guess -- I guess the -- the question that underlies Justice Breyer's question about civil rights is something along the lines of: You know, that's consistent with our structure of government. We have dual sovereigns. That means dual regulation. And dual regulation often means dual punishment. And if we were to adopt the rule that you suggest, it might very well be that either the federal government would have to subordinate its interests to the states or that the states would have to subordinate their interests to the federal government. And one of the things about our constitutional structure makes -- which makes it unusual is that -- is that both sovereigns are understood to have significant interests that they have the capacity to pursue. Yeah. Well, I read Furlong a little bit differently, as actually separating out the offense of piracy, which was an offense that sort of was in common, versus the offense of murder, which Furlong says, yes, each different jurisdiction can prosecute the offense. I guess I would ask -- I suppose my -- my main question, which actually goes back to Justice Gorsuch's question, because Justice Gorsuch has been trying to lead you away from something, and I'm a little bit also confused as -- as to why your argument seems, frankly, a little bit one note. You know, your -- your brief and now your argument is just all about the original jurisdiction. And there are some people on this bench that think that that is the Alpha and Omega of every constitutional question. But there are other people on this bench who do not, who think that 170 years of significant practice where 30 Justices have signed on to a rule, that you're going to have to give me more than the fact that, you know, actually, pretty early on in the republic they decided that that was not what the original understanding was, even if they're wrong. And so this is your opportunity to give me more. May I ask, Mr. Feigin, do you think that there's a prospect of abuse where two different governments can use the possibility of prosecutions as a bargaining tactic to get defendants to agree to plea deals? Is -- is -- is that something that happens regularly? I think what your friends on the other side might say to that is something along the lines of: Well, it's one thing to pick the higher penalty and, you know, let the state or the -- or the government with the higher penalty go forward. The problem with this is that you can get both. ",but but mr chaiten i think i think the point be that you be ask us to write an opinion which be base on this original understanding and the original understanding as you put it apply between foreign country and a fortiori it must be that our decision would apply between foreign country and that be what that be that be that be what your brief be all about that be what you be ask us to say that the original understanding be that there would be no double jeopardy bar between different sovereign when those sovereign be foreign country so how could we avoid that consequence well can i ask you a different could you say a little bit more about why you think incorporation or the lack of incorporation have anything to do with this question i mean there be that reference in fox but it honestly make no sense that incorporation would be the basis of the doctrine because if incorporation we be the basis of the doctrine you would have a doctrine that only cut one way in other word it would it would the court would have hold that the federal government can not prosecute an individual for the same offense after a state prosecution but not the other way around so the fact that there be not a one way ratchet but that in fact it be a symmetrical rule suggest that incorporation have nothing to do with it at all i i guess what strike me mr chaiten be that you can say well you know this case be a little bit different in this case the argument be not properly present in this case there be something else that be the matter but you know this be an year old rule and it be an year old rule that be be rely on by close on justice have vote at one time or another specifically for this rule not an application of this but for this rule and you know part of what stare decisis be be a kind of doctrine of humility where we say we be really uncomfortable throw over year old rule that justice have approve just because we think we can kind of do it well but mr chaiten i mean one of the I be sorry please well i guess i guess the the question that underlies justice breyer s question about civil right be something along the line of you know that be consistent with our structure of government we have dual sovereign that mean dual regulation and dual regulation often mean dual punishment and if we we be to adopt the rule that you suggest it might very well be that either the federal government would have to subordinate its interest to the state or that the state would have to subordinate their interest to the federal government and one of the thing about our constitutional structure make which make it unusual be that be that both sovereign be understood to have significant interest that they have the capacity to pursue yeah well i read furlong a little bit differently as actually separate out the offense of piracy which be an offense that sort of be in common versus the offense of murder which furlong say yes each different jurisdiction can prosecute the offense i guess i would ask i suppose my my main question which actually go back to justice gorsuch s question because justice gorsuch have be try to lead you away from something and I be a little bit also confuse as as to why your argument seem frankly a little bit one note you know your your brief and now your argument be just all about the original jurisdiction and there be some people on this bench that think that that be the alpha and omega of every constitutional question but there be other people on this bench who do not who think that year of significant practice where justice have sign on to a rule that you be go to have to give me more than the fact that you know actually pretty early on in the republic they decide that that be not what the original understanding be even if they be wrong and so this be your opportunity to give me more may i ask mr feigin do you think that there be a prospect of abuse where two different government can use the possibility of prosecution as a bargaining tactic to get defendant to agree to plea deal be be be that something that happen regularly i think what your friend on the other side might say to that be something along the line of well it be one thing to pick the high penalty and you know let the state or the or the government with the high penalty go forward the problem with this be that you can get both ,272.24,Case pending,"Dec 6, 2018",Terance Martez Gamble,United States,17-646,"Jun 28, 2018",,114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2018,The American Legion v. American Humanist Association,114,Elena Kagan,"What would happen if all the facts that you gave were the same, except for the 93 years? In other words, a community decides, for whatever reason, we don't have a World War I memorial; we want to put up exactly this to memorialize the -- the -- the war dead from -- from World War I, but now. And -- and does that answer apply not just to memorials for World War I soldiers but to memorials for soldiers from any armed conflict? Well, here are some facts, Mr. Katyal, from that hypothetical. And you can understand how something like this can come about, that people want to memorialize the dead, and in one religious tradition, and a dominant one in many, many communities of this country, the preeminent symbol to memorialize the dead is the Latin cross. And -- and so they gravitate toward that symbol as a way to memorialize the dead. But, at the same time, for members of other faiths, that symbol is not a way to memorialize the dead and does not have that meaning. So I think that the question that Justice Ginsburg is asking, you know, for many people, this is a very natural way to do exactly what they want to do. For others, not. What -- what counts as proselytizing? I think I understand what coercion means better than what proselytizing means. Well, suppose a city -- -- suppose a city erected a cross not for purposes of memorializing the war dead or -- but just to emphasize the values of Christianity. Would -- would that be proselytizing, or would that not be proselytizing? Right. This one is not -- -- on top of City Hall. This one is, you know, in a park. It's just a cross. This is -- they want to emphasize the values of Christianity, so they put up a cross. Well, I guess what -- what -- what I was trying to suggest was that this was something that indicated that the city was aligning itself with one particular religion. We're putting up a cross. We're not putting up any other religious symbols because we believe in the values that the cross indicates. But it's -- it's not on top of City Hall. It's on a street. It's in a park. Maybe there are two crosses. Maybe there could be 10 crosses, you know, in different parts of the city. But that's why the -- the -- the city is doing it. And, of course, everybody recognizes what a cross is. Well, is there? It's just a -- it's just a cross. It really is. So it's -- it's -- it's -- you know, these values are important to this community, the values of Christianity, so we would like to put up some crosses around town. Justice Scalia once -- -- Justice Scalia once asked a question when somebody gave that example. He said, what -- what would happen if a coin had said ""In Jesus Christ we trust""? But do I -- So, Mr. Wall, just to -- -- figure out where you want to draw the line, just take a lot -- I'm going to give you an example of a bunch of different crosses. So one is World War I cross erected many, many years ago. Another is World War I cross erected now. A third is another war memorial cross. A fourth is a memorial cross that has nothing to do with any war. A fifth -- are we up to five? A fifth is not a memorial cross at all, just a cross, it's a cross, because a community wants to put up a cross. Are they all okay? Are some not okay? And the fifth? Could -- Could you take the -- the examples I gave that are neither the first nor the fifth, in other words, just the memorial crosses but not any particular relationship to World War I, and -- and erected now. On -- on what theory are -- are -- are -- are those permissible? In other words, when -- when -- is the theory that this is a universal symbol? Is the theory that this is a secular symbol? Is the theory that this is a religious symbol, but that's perfectly fine, to adopt one religious symbol rather than another? What's the theory? I think that that's an odd kind of case, so I -- I think let's -- let's not talk about that one. Let's just talk about your ordinary decision to erect -- to -- you know, not anything that's found in a -- you know, let's just talk about -- -- an ordinary municipal decision to erect a cross as a way to memorialize some group of citizens. And -- and I guess I ask, why is that? Is it because the cross has become a symbol that's universal? Is that what your -- your claim is? I mean, it is the foremost symbol of Christianity, isn't it? It invokes the central theological claim of Christianity, that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for humanity's sins and that he rose from the dead. This is why Christians use crosses as a way to memorialize the dead. Is it because it connects to that central theological belief, isn't that correct? May -- may I ask about this cross -- I'm sorry. So this cross, Ms. Miller -- This cross, Ms. Miller -- -- it's very old, was erected almost 100 years ago, right after World War I. It does have -- it's two fallen soldiers from World War I, and World War I does have this history that this is how soldiers were memorialized in World War I. And it's true not all soldiers. When you go into a World War I battlefield, there are Stars of David there, but because those battlefields were just rows and rows and rows of crosses, the cross became, in people's minds, the preeminent symbol of how to memorialize World War I dead. And then you have these other facts that Mr. Katyal started us off with. There are other war memorials around the park. There's no -- there are no religious words on the memorial, quite the opposite. All the words on the memorial are words about military valor and so forth. So why in a case like that can we not say essentially the religious content has been stripped of this monument? Or the particular religious content? Well, I guess what I'm -- what I'm suggesting -- And I really did mean to confine it to this World War I context, because I think there's something quite different about this historic moment in time when -- so if you look -- you know, if you look at all the crosses that are war memorials, they're basically all World War I memorials, that this was sort of the -- because of the battlefields and the way the crosses were erected there, this became the preeminent symbol for how to memorialize the war dead at that time. Why isn't that important? Ms. Miller -- -- why does it even matter -- Ms. -- Ms. Miller, I -- I've been struck, some of these questions about how people process these symbols and what messages they convey, that you've sort of accepted this idea that that's what we should be thinking about. But why isn't it enough to just say: Does erecting a symbol like this align the government with a particular religion and not align it with every other religion? ",what would happen if all the fact that you give we be the same except for the year in other word a community decide for whatever reason we do not have a world war i memorial we want to put up exactly this to memorialize the the the war dead from from world war i but now and and do that answer apply not just to memorial for world war i soldier but to memorial for soldier from any arm conflict well here be some fact mr katyal from that hypothetical and you can understand how something like this can come about that people want to memorialize the dead and in one religious tradition and a dominant one in many many community of this country the preeminent symbol to memorialize the dead be the latin cross and and so they gravitate toward that symbol as a way to memorialize the dead but at the same time for member of other faith that symbol be not a way to memorialize the dead and do not have that meaning so i think that the question that justice ginsburg be ask you know for many people this be a very natural way to do exactly what they want to do for others not what what count as proselytizing i think i understand what coercion mean good than what proselytize mean well suppose a city suppose a city erect a cross not for purpose of memorialize the war dead or but just to emphasize the value of christianity would would that be proselytize or would that not be proselytize right this one be not on top of city hall this one be you know in a park it be just a cross this be they want to emphasize the value of christianity so they put up a cross well i guess what what what i be try to suggest be that this be something that indicate that the city be align itself with one particular religion we be put up a cross we be not put up any other religious symbol because we believe in the value that the cross indicate but it be it be not on top of city hall it be on a street it be in a park maybe there be two cross maybe there could be cross you know in different part of the city but that be why the the the city be do it and of course everybody recognize what a cross be well be there it be just a it be just a cross it really be so it be it be it be you know these value be important to this community the value of christianity so we would like to put up some cross around town justice scalia once justice scalia once ask a question when somebody give that example he say what what would happen if a coin have say in jesus christ we trust but do i so mr wall just to figure out where you want to draw the line just take a lot I be go to give you an example of a bunch of different cross so one be world war i cross erect many many year ago another be world war i cross erect now a third be another war memorial cross a fourth be a memorial cross

one let us just talk about your ordinary decision to erect to you know not anything that be find in a you know let us just talk about an ordinary municipal decision to erect a cross as a way to

use cross as a way to memorialize the dead be it because it connect to that central theological belief be not that correct may may i ask about this cross I be sorry so this cross ms miller this cross ms miller it be very old be erect almost year ago right after world war i it do have it be two fallen soldier from world war i and world war i do have this history that this be how soldier we be

that important ms miller why do it even matter ms ms miller i I have be strike some of these question about how people process these symbol and what message they convey that you have sort of accepted

2018,Henry Schein Inc. v. Archer and White Sales Inc.,114,Elena Kagan,"But why is that -- -- Mr. Shanmugam? I mean, if you look at First Options, First Options is a case where we said we're not going to treat these delegation clauses in exactly the same way as we treat other clauses. And there was an idea that people don't really think about the question of who decides, and so we're going to hold parties to this higher standard, the clear and unmistakable intent standard. And wouldn't the same kind of argument be true here, that the parties never really considered who was going to decide these groundless claims of arbitrability, or maybe, if they did consider it, they would have thought that it was a pretty strange system to send it to an arbitrator just so that the arbitrator could send it back to the court? So that we are going to -- to -- you know, to -- to say that there's a special rule in interpreting these kinds of clauses. Mr. Shanmugam -- Well, how can it do that? If the court can't even take a peek at the arbitrability question itself, how does the court all of a sudden have the power to sanction a motion to compel? Mr. Geyser, can I go back to Justice Kavanaugh's textual question, because, when I stare at this language, ""the failure to comply therewith"" language, it seems to me I can read it two ways, neither of which is yours. So the first way is Mr. Shanmugam's minimalist way. It doesn't mean very much of anything at all. The second way suggests that we've gone wrong in -- in prior cases. It's the maximalist approach, which is what this language was meant to do was assign arbitrability issues to the courts, but we've -- we've pretty much -- we've -- we've gone by that -- that understanding of the language. What I can't understand is how you can read the language to create this halfway house position. The ship has sailed. We're agreeing that the ship has sailed. Could I go back? Beyond your saying it's not an efficient system, are you saying essentially that the -- that the basis for this rule is that we don't believe that a delegation clause includes this, that we don't believe that the parties intended for a general delegation clause to include these kinds of groundless questions? Is that basically the idea? The contractual idea. Yes. So -- but -- but -- so, I mean, that might be a rule of -- of the -- of contract interpretation here, but you're trying to say that the FAA, specifically Section 4, sets up as a kind of substantive interpretive rule that we're going to interpret these contracts in a certain way. And that seems like a strange thing for us to think about, the FAA. It is a little bit different, though, Mr. Shanmugam, because in -- in the case that you said, if it's really groundless, you expect that the arbitrator will get rid of it just as fast as the court will get rid of it. What makes this case a little bit different from that is that, here, all the arbitrator is going to do is to send it back to the court. And you might think: Well, what sense does that make? ",but why be that mr shanmugam i mean if you look at first option first option be a case where we say we be not go to treat these delegation clause in exactly the same way as we treat other clause and there be an idea that people do not really think about the question of who decide and so we be go to hold party to this high standard the clear and unmistakable intent standard and would not the same kind of argument be true here that the party never really consider who be go to decide these groundless claim of arbitrability or maybe if they do consider it they would have think that it be a pretty strange system to send it to an arbitrator just so that the arbitrator could send it back to the court so that we be go to to you know to to say that there be a special rule in interpret these kind of clause mr shanmugam well how can it do that if the court can not even take a peek at the arbitrability question itself how do the court all of a sudden have the power to sanction a motion to compel mr geyser can i go back to justice kavanaugh s textual question because when i stare at this language the failure to comply therewith language it seem to me i can read it two way neither of which be yours so the first way be mr shanmugam s minimalist way it do not mean very much of anything at all the second way suggest that we have go wrong in in prior case it be the maximalist approach which be what this language be mean to do be assign arbitrability issue to the court but we have we have pretty much we have we have go by that that understanding of the language what i can not understand be how you can read the language to create this halfway house position the ship have sail we be agree that the ship have sail could i go back beyond your say it be not an efficient system be you say essentially that the that the basis for this rule be that we do not believe that a delegation clause include this that we do not believe that the party intend for a general delegation clause to include these kind of groundless question be that basically the idea the contractual idea yes so but but so i mean that might be a rule of of the of contract interpretation here but you be try to say that the faa specifically section set up as a kind of substantive interpretive rule that we be go to interpret these contract in a certain way and that seem like a strange thing for us to think about the faa it be a little bit different though mr shanmugam because in in the case that you say if it be really groundless you expect that the arbitrator will get rid of it just as fast as the court will get rid of it what make this case a little bit different from that be that here all the arbitrator be go to do be to send it back to the court and you might think well what sense do that make ,176.16,Roberts Court,"Oct 29, 2018","Henry Schein, Inc., et al.","Archer and White Sales, Inc.",17-1272,"Jun 25, 2018","Jan 8, 2019",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

Justice Sotomayor says this, ""in connection with"" is a very broad phrase. But I guess, on the other hand, how is it grammatically possible to say that a person is, ""is"" meaning ""is,"" suggesting ""currently is,"" imprisoned in connection with a conviction if the conviction hasn't occurred yet? I mean, ""in connection with,"" as I say, I totally accept your point that it's very broad, but the question is whether it can effectively change the tense of the statute just because it's so broad. And -- and -- and that seems a strange way to read language to me. But doesn't it? Because if -- let's, you know, go back a little bit in the statute. It says that the term doesn't run when the person is imprisoned in connection with a conviction. Right? So when doesn't the term run? The term doesn't run when the person is imprisoned in connection with a conviction, meaning that the conviction has to have occurred and the person has to have been imprisoned in connection with it. No? Even under -- am I right about this -- that even under your view of the statute, you will run into that problem in certain situations? You'll run into it when the confinement is for fewer than 30 days, and you'll run into it when the defendant ends up being acquitted. Isn't that right? So why is this so different?

2018,Mount Lemmon Fire District v. Guido,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Rosenkranz -- Mr. Rosenkranz, in the term ""also means"" in that sentence, you agree, don't you, that the term is the same term as in the first sentence? In other words, the term is employer, is that correct? Employer, the term employer also means? I mean, here are your two choices -- -- the term employer or the term person. What is the term in the second sentence? Is it an employer? Okay. So it -- it's just odd because you say that what this clause is meant to do is to make clear that ""person"" is defined in such a way as to include subdivisions. So what you're essentially doing is converting the phrase which says the term ""employer"" also means, and converting that into the term ""person,"" just to make clear, includes. But the clarifying with respect to the subdivisions would not be necessary, except for the fact that there's doubt in the person definition. That's where your doubt comes from. It comes from the fact that the person definition is not unambiguous. I don't -- I don't -- what is the other source of the doubt? It's all the source of the doubt, isn't it? No, I understand that you say that there are anomalies if done in a different way, but the doubt arises from the ambiguity of the term ""person."" So that's why I'm suggesting that it would be a strange way to resolve that doubt, instead of to just say, by the way, a person includes a subdivision, instead of saying that, to say the term ""employer"" also means a subdivision. Is this, Mr. Fisher, the only federal statute that you're aware of that imposes an obligation on a small political subdivision but not -- does not impose the corresponding obligation on a small private employer? But how -- But I guess I wonder, Mr. Fisher, how your reading of the agent clause allows us to make this distinction that both you suggest and the solicitor general suggests between entities and individuals? I mean, it says any agent of such a person, and it doesn't on its face make any such distinction. So how would we go about doing that? Well, is that true, Mr. Bond? Because, on -- on Petitioner's theory, which is to say that this is just a reference to respondeat superior liability and basically says that the employer shall have such liability for any agent, wouldn't that include these corporate shells that you're talking about? Independent contractors, is that what you meant? Or -- But even in the face -- -- of statutory language that says the agent of such a person? I -- I mean, these corporate shells are acting as the agent of such a person. ",mr rosenkranz mr rosenkranz in the term also mean in that sentence you agree do not you that the term be the same term as in the first sentence in other word the term be employer be that correct employer the term employer also mean i mean here be your two choice the term employer or the term person what be the term in the second sentence be it an employer okay so it it be just odd because you say that what this clause be mean to do be to make clear that person be define in such a way as to include subdivision so what you be essentially do be convert the phrase which say the term employer also mean and convert that into the term person just to make clear include but the clarifying with respect to the subdivision would not be necessary except for the fact that there be doubt in the person definition that be where your doubt come from it come from the fact that the person definition be not unambiguous i do not i do not what be the other source of the doubt it be all the source of the doubt be not it no i understand that you say that there be anomaly if do in a different way but the doubt arise from the ambiguity of the term person so that be why I be suggest that it would be a strange way to resolve that doubt instead of to just say by the way a person include a subdivision instead of say that to say the term employer also mean a subdivision be this mr fisher the only federal statute that you be aware of that impose an obligation on a small political subdivision but not do not impose the corresponding obligation on a small private employer but how but i guess i wonder mr fisher how your reading of the agent clause allow us to make this distinction that both you suggest and the solicitor general suggest between entity and individual i mean it say any agent of such a person and it do not on its face make any such distinction so how would we go about do that well be that true mr bond because on on petitioner s theory which be to say that this be just a reference to respondeat superior liability and basically say that the employer shall have such liability for any agent would not that include these corporate shell that you be talk about independent contractor be that what you mean or but even in the face of statutory language that say the agent of such a person i i mean these corporate shell be act as the agent of such a person ,169.6,Roberts Court,"Oct 1, 2018",Mount Lemmon Fire District,"John Guido, et al.",17-587,"Feb 26, 2018","Nov 6, 2018",114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2018,Timbs v. Indiana,114,Elena Kagan,"So we are several steps removed, but I think that the import of some of these questions is, look, we've made it awfully, awfully hard to assert a disproportionality claim with respect even to imprisonment. And if it's at least equally hard to assert a disproportionality claim with respect to fines, we could incorporate this tomorrow and it would have no effect on anybody. What is the -- on the federal side, how does this work? What kind of forfeitures have been held unconstitutional? Have any? If I -- if I understood your response to Justice Gorsuch, it was essentially that we can't answer the question wholesale, that we have to look at the particular right being invoked. So I guess the question is, do you have a theory about how we go about dividing up rights? You know, how do we decide that we're looking at a particular right against in rem forfeitures as opposed to a general right against excessive fines? I mean, that seems to make the incorporation question sort of indistinguishable from the substantive question. But, again, it -- it just seems as though there are two questions, and one question is incorporating the right, and the other question is the scope of the right to be incorporated. And, really, what you're arguing is about the scope of the right. And we can incorporate the right -- -- without saying a word about the scope of the right. Now, as you say, Austin says something about the scope of the right, and that's a problem for you. But -- but you're really asking us to talk about the scope of the right, aren't you? Well, that's why -- why I asked at the beginning what's your theory for how you define the right and which history you look to -- -- because you're really suggesting that we don't take the right wholesale; we try to chop it up. And I guess, you know, there are always going to be questions about the scope of the right to be incorporated. And, so far, we have not addressed those questions when we've decided whether to flip the switch of incorporation or not. We've understood those questions to be distinct and -- and to be questions for another day. And why is it that you're saying we should not use that pretty standard practice and instead start chopping up the right at the incorporation stage? ",so we be several step remove but i think that the import of some of these question be look we have make it awfully awfully hard to assert a disproportionality claim with respect even to imprisonment and if it be at least equally hard to assert a disproportionality claim with respect to fine we could incorporate this tomorrow and it would have no effect on anybody what be the on the federal side how do this work what kind of forfeiture have be hold unconstitutional have any if i if i understand your response to justice gorsuch it be essentially that we can not answer the question wholesale that we have to look at the particular right be invoke so i guess the question be do you have a theory about how we go about divide up right you know how do we decide that we be look at a particular right against in rem forfeiture as oppose to a general right against excessive fine i mean that seem to make the incorporation question sort of indistinguishable from the substantive question but again it it just seem as though there be two question and one question be incorporate the right and the other question be the scope of the right to be incorporate and really what you be argue be about the scope of the right and we can incorporate the right without say a word about the scope of the right now as you say austin say something about the scope of the right and that be a problem for you but but you be really ask us to talk about the scope of the right be not you well that be why why i ask at the begin what be your theory for how you define the right and which history you look to because you be really suggest that we do not take the right wholesale we try to chop it up and i guess you know there be always go to be question about the scope of the right to be incorporate and so far we have not address those question when we have decide whether to flip the switch of incorporation or not we have understand those question to be distinct and and to be question for another day and why be it that you be say we should not use that pretty standard practice and instead start chop up the right at the incorporation stage ,140.76000000000005,Roberts Court,"Nov 28, 2018",Tyson Timbs,Indiana,17-1091,"Jun 18, 2018","Feb 20, 2019",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2018,"Lamps Plus, Inc. v. Varela",114,Elena Kagan,"May I ask, Mr. Pincus, if you could go back to the -- the substantive argument? So, in -- in a strange kind of way, it occurred to me, as Mr. Geyser was speaking, your position is very similar to Mr. Geyser's. You both have these very broad -- this very broad contractual language, right? He had a broad delegation clause, and you have contractual language that refers to all disputes, claims, or controversies in lieu of any and all suits or other civil legal proceedings. And -- and what I hear you to be saying is essentially that you want to say except for class suits. Is that right? Well, I -- I'm just thinking as a -- as a matter first of -- of just contract law, because he said what we have here is we can't really believe that the parties agreed to include a certain set of things. And -- and I hear you to be saying the same thing. We can't really believe that the parties agreed to be speaking of class claims. Well, it seems to me, I mean, there's -- there's language that's in favor of each side's position. The ""all disputes, claims, or controversies,"" ""all suits or other legal proceedings"" goes against you. You would suggest that ""I, me, and my"" cuts for you. You know, I'm -- I'm -- I'm not quite sure that that's the case, but -- you know, because it's an agreement between these two parties about suits, and the question is, what kind of suits is it about and whether there's a kind of implicit exception for class claims in suits. Yes, but in -- in Stolt-Nielsen, there was no contract. There was no agreement. And, you know, everybody understood there was a stipulation to the effect that there was no agreement on this issue and -- and -- and instead there was just a -- a policy determination. But, here, there is a contract. And the question is, what does the contract mean? Does it mean all disputes, claims, or controversies? Or does it mean all disputes, claims, or controversies, except class disputes, claims, and controversies because we really think that not -- that the party would not -- that the party who drafted the contract would not have agreed to that? Well, we would never say -- -- that in general. A general clause usually speaks to the things inside it. If I say all furniture, it usually means tables and chairs. If I say all clothing, it usually means pants and shirts. And we don't insist that everybody lay out all the subcategories of things. So this question is here you have an overall, you know, term, ""disputes, claims, or controversies."" Why wouldn't you include class disputes, claims, or controversies, unless there's some kind of special contractual interpretive rule coming in that we wouldn't apply in other contexts? Okay. But if I got you right, your said your principal position is that there's a federal rule that would come in even if the California courts got California law right, and that in many cases analogous to this, you would have read this contract to include both class claims and individual claims. It's really a federal rule that you're asking for. Right. You know, I guess I gave you a bunch of reasons why, in looking at a normal contract, under normal contractual principles, you might think that all this extremely general language included everything inside it. But you're saying, no, even if you think that, there's a federal law that comes into play. Right. I'm not -- I'm just trying to get a handle on what you're saying. So -- so you're saying it's a federal rule. So I guess my question is, where does the federal rule come from? Quite right. So Stolt-Nielsen said -- but Stolt-Nielsen was a case where there clearly -- where the Court specifically said there was no intent of the parties, there was no agreement as to the particular issue in front of it. So, in my hypothetical where the -- the -- the court is saying: Well, under state law, we would interpret this to understand that there was an intent of the parties and that there was an agreement as to this question, you're saying, notwithstanding that Stolt-Nielsen said that we didn't decide that question, that a federal rule comes into play. And I guess I'm going to ask the same question because I don't think it comes from Stolt-Nielsen, where there was no agreement at all. So where does the federal rule come from? See, I thought -- go ahead. Please. Because the only federal rule was that it needed to be based on an agreement of the parties, because it said arbitration is a matter of consent, and that's all over the Arbitration Act. But the question of how to understand whether parties have consented, that's usually a question of state law. And you are saying a federal rule should come in and say, notwithstanding state law saying that these two parties have agreed to something, the federal rule under the Arbitration Act says no. And usually what the Federal Arbitration Act does is it -- it surely does come into play when you're afraid that the state law is discriminating against arbitration agreements. But where there is no such concern -- and I don't think that there is such a concern if the state -- if the state courts just say we're going to treat general language as including everything inside it -- then I don't see where the federal law comes into play to create a different contract interpretive rule. One quick one, Mr. Pincus. You say in your brief that you do not necessarily argue for a clear statement rule. You agree that you didn't make that argument below. So what language, short of a clear statement, would lead you to conclude that this agreement was intended to authorize class arbitration? No, I mean what would be enough for you to switch your position, essentially? Like if this -- if this -- if -- you say a clear statement rule isn't required, but, you know, what -- what kind of language would say, ah, I can see that the parties agreed to class arbitration there? ",may i ask mr pincus if you could go back to the the substantive argument so in in a strange kind of way it occur to me as mr geyser be speak your position be very similar to mr geyser s you both have these very broad this very broad contractual language right he have a broad delegation clause and you have contractual language that refer to all dispute claim or controversy in lieu of any and all suit or other civil legal proceeding and and what i hear you to be say be essentially that you want to say except for class suit be that right well i I be just think as a as a matter first of of just contract law because he say what we have here be we can not really believe that the party agree to include a certain set of thing and and i hear you to be say the same thing we can not really believe that the party agree to be speak of class claim well it seem to me i mean there be there be language that be in favor of each side s position the all dispute claim or controversy all suit or other legal proceeding go against you you would suggest that i me and my cut for you you know I be I be I be not quite sure that that be the case but you know because it be an agreement between these two party about suit and the question be what kind of suit be it about and whether there be a kind of implicit exception for class claim in suit yes but in in stolt nielsen there be no contract there be no agreement and you know everybody understood there be a stipulation to the effect that there be no agreement on this issue and and and instead there be just a a policy determination but here there be a contract and the question be what do the contract mean do it mean all dispute claim or controversy or do it mean all dispute claim or controversy except class dispute claim and controversy because we really think that not that the party would not that the party who draft the contract would not have agree to that well we would never say that in general a general clause usually speak to the thing inside it if i say all furniture it usually mean table and chair if i say all clothing it usually mean pant and shirt and we do not insist that everybody lay out all the subcategories of thing so this question be here you have an overall you know term dispute claim or controversy why would not you include class dispute claim or controversy unless there be some kind of special contractual interpretive rule come in that we would not apply in other context okay but if i get you right your say your principal position be that there be a federal rule that would come in even if the california court get california law right and that in many case analogous to this you would have read this contract to include both class claim and individual claim it be really a federal rule that you be ask for right you know i guess i give you a bunch of reason why in look at a normal contract under normal contractual principle you might think that all this extremely general language include everything inside it but you be say no even if you think that there be a federal law that come into play right I be not I be just try to get a handle on what you be say so so you be say it be a federal rule so i guess my question be where do the federal rule come from quite right so stolt nielsen say but stolt nielsen be a case where there clearly where the court specifically say there be no intent of the party there be no agreement as to the particular issue in front of it so in my hypothetical where the the the court be say well under state law we would interpret this to understand that there be an intent of the party and that there be an agreement as to this question you be say notwithstanding that stolt nielsen say that we do not decide that question that a federal rule come into play and i guess I be go to ask the same question because i do not think it come from stolt nielsen where there be no agreement at all so where do the federal rule come from see i think go ahead please because the only federal rule be that it need to be base on an agreement of the party because it say arbitration be a matter of consent and that be all over the arbitration act but the question of how to understand whether party have consent that be usually a question of state law and you be say a federal rule should come in and say notwithstanding state law say that these two party have agree to something the federal rule under the arbitration act say no and usually what the federal arbitration act do be it it surely do come into play when you be afraid that the state law be discriminate against arbitration agreement but where there be no such concern and i do not think that there be such a concern if the state if the state court just say we be go to treat general language as include everything inside it then i do not see where the federal law come into play to create a different contract interpretive rule one quick one mr pincus you say in your brief that you do not necessarily argue for a clear statement rule you agree that you do not make that argument below so what language short of a clear statement would lead you to conclude that this agreement be intend to authorize class arbitration no i mean what would be enough for you to switch your position essentially like if this if this if you say a clear statement rule be not require but you know what what kind of language would say ah i can see that the party agree to class arbitration there ,363.82,Case pending,"Oct 29, 2018","Lamps Plus, Inc., et al.",Frank Varela,17-988,"Apr 30,

2018,Tennessee Wine and Spirits Retailers Association v. Blair,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. -- Mr. Franklin, you're representing quite a number of states, including Tennessee, I guess. Maybe? These states have very varying residency requirements. And I want to take you back to Justice Alito's question. Tennessee appears to be on one end of the spectrum. And is there anything in your argument that would give us a way to say, you know, when there's a 12-year residency requirement, when there's a 100 percent shareholder requirement, these have stopped being public health and safety measures; these are clearly protectionist and we should not allow those to occur? Well, it's not arbitrary if you are intending to promote economic protectionism. And as I understand your position, it's that that's part of the states' prerogatives too. And then, you know, the sky is the limit. Every -- the more you do, the more protectionist it gets. I -- I guess, Mr. Franklin, the -- that a question that followed from my last is wouldn't it be a better idea if we said the dormant Commerce Clause does apply, and then let the state come back and say we can meet that test; we have real health and safety concerns here, and our law is well tailored to address those concerns. And so it's not a dormant Commerce Clause violation. Is that your standard? Because you seem to slide back and forth a little bit between standards in your brief -- or -- or I thought that you did maybe. If -- if a state can come forward with any purpose other than protectionism, the state wins? Well, suppose a state comes forward and says: We like this because it's protectionist. We were trying to do -- -- some protectionist things. And we also, coincidentally, we found a way that our protectionist interests matched up completely with our health and safety interests. What happens then? But, to go back to Justice Gorsuch's question, I mean, I'm trying to figure out what kind of opinion we could write, Mr. Phillips, that says you win, but then, when the next case comes along and the next case is somebody that says we don't like this brick-and-mortar stuff, we don't want to have any physical presence at all, and the state is preventing that, and in doing so, the state is discriminating against out-of-state companies. And, you know, you've said that that's not valid, so we're entitled to do what we want to do too. Well, we're leaving a lot of things for another day, but they all seem to be demanded by the principles that you're asking us to adopt. I guess what I'm asking -- Because the hypothetical I was attempting to pose is a hypothetical where the state is acting in a discriminatory manner. And I guess I'm -- what I'm asking you for is, why would some kinds of discrimination be permissible and other kinds of discrimination not be permissible? ",mr mr franklin you be represent quite a number of state include tennessee i guess maybe these state have very varying residency requirement and i want to take you back to justice alito s question tennessee appear to be on one end of the spectrum and be there anything in your argument that would give us a way to say you know when there be a year residency requirement when there be a percent shareholder requirement these have stop be public health and safety measure these be clearly protectionist and we should not allow those to occur well it be not arbitrary if you be intend to promote economic protectionism and as i understand your position it be that that be part of the state prerogative too and then you know the sky be the limit every the more you do the more protectionist it get i i guess mr franklin the that a question that follow from my last be would not it be a good idea if we say the dormant commerce clause do apply and then let the state come back and say we can meet that test we have real health and safety concern here and our law be well tailor to address those concern and so it be not a dormant commerce clause violation be that your standard because you seem to slide back and forth a little bit between standard in your brief or or i think that you do maybe if if a state can come forward with any purpose other than protectionism the state win well suppose a state come forward and say we like this because it be protectionist we we be try to do some protectionist thing and we also coincidentally we find a way that our protectionist interest match up completely with our health and safety interest what happen then but to go back to justice gorsuch s question i mean I be try to figure out what kind of opinion we could write mr phillips that say you win but then when the next case come along and the next case be somebody that say we do not like this brick and mortar stuff we do not want to have any physical presence at all and the state be prevent that and in do so the state be discriminate against out of state company and you know you have say that that be not valid so we be entitle to do what we want to do too well we be leave a lot of thing for another day but they all seem to be demand by the principle that you be ask us to adopt i guess what I be ask because the hypothetical i be attempt to pose be a hypothetical where the state be act in a discriminatory manner and i guess I be what I be ask you for be why would some kind of discrimination be permissible and other kind of discrimination not be permissible ,169.68,Case pending,"Jan 16, 2019",Tennessee Wine and Spirits Retailers Association,"Zackary W.

2018,Sturgeon v. Frost,114,Elena Kagan,"And you don't think it makes any difference if there are public lands on both sides of a river? In other words, both banks of a river are public lands, but still the federal government cannot regulate the river running through those lands? What does that do to your federalism argument? Because, at various times in your brief, you press federalism concerns. But I'm wondering, if those concerns have a lot of weight, if what you're really saying is not this agency but that agency? Well, how does it do that? I'm sorry. Could I ask you to go back to the -- Could I ask you to go back to the applicable -- regulations applicable solely to public lands? And you suggested that that language is what distinguishes Park Service regulations from, let's say, EPA regulations. But, when I read that language, ""regulations applicable solely to public lands,"" it seems to be making a distinction between regulations that apply solely, exclusively to public lands and those that apply more broadly to both public and private lands. That seems to be the distinction this makes on its face. So I guess I don't quite get how -- how you make it into something different. But -- but -- but -- But I guess solely to public lands, is like if you take out the -- if you take out the word ""solely,"" this -- this is saying solely to public lands as compared to what, as compared to -- to public lands and something else, meaning non-public lands. And that seems to be the distinction it's drawing: solely to public lands, or to public lands and something else, non-public lands. I -- I understand what -- I think it's a good point, the point you make about, look, if it were public lands versus public and non-public lands, this would not be doing very much. But I guess what I want to know from you is, like, why pick this language to convey what you want to convey? I mean, how do I have to manipulate this language to get it to mean what you want it to mean? But, I mean, what -- what -- what could you do to this language to make it more like what you're suggesting it means? Because I look at this language, it just doesn't say -- it's just not anywhere close to what you're saying it means. But maybe I'm wrong about that. I really am trying -- I'm struggling with this. But, if I understand your view, Mr. Kneedler, what you're saying this means is that non-public lands shall not be subject to regulations that are applicable only to public lands. And you don't need a statute to tell you that. Of course, non-public lands aren't subject to regulations applicable solely to public lands. If that's what the statute was saying, who would need a statute? But just on the face of things, Mr. Kneedler, if -- if the Park Service issues a regulation and the regulation says this applies only to public lands within a park, right, and you're not a public land within a park, you're a private land within a park, what kind of assurance do you need? It's like you know that you're not a public land, so it doesn't matter that you're in the park. You don't need a special statute to tell you that, do you? You only need a special statute if the special statute exempts you from something that would otherwise apply to you.

It's not a good reason for repeating yourself. Mr. Clement -- -- you agree that if the word ""full"" wasn't in the statute you would lose? Okay. So we -- we decided a case earlier this year on the basis of the legal proposition that adjectives modify nouns. Why doesn't that kill you in this case? In other words, ""full"" can only modify costs as defined in 1920. But that's a strange kind of thing, because you -- we started, you said, if it just said cost, we would all understand that it was the term of art in 1920 costs. And then you say that by adding the word ""full,"" rather than to say, look, it really is the full amount of the 1920 costs, don't try slicing and dicing the 1920 costs, rather, you want to use the word ""full"" to suggest that it's not the 1920 costs we're talking about at all.
