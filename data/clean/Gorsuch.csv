2017,Minnesota Voters Alliance v. Mansky,115,Neil Gorsuch,"Mr. -- Mr. Breemer -- -- passive versus active sounds a lot like the act/omission distinction, and that has proven to be one of the most slippery concepts in all of law. Is it an act to put on a button or is it an omission to not speak about what's on the button? A T-shirt, you say, is passive. What if it were instead a sign on my head, you know, flashing lights? Is that active or is that passive? How are we supposed to police the line you're -- you're suggesting? Is there -- is there any evidence -- usually, in First Amendment cases, we're concerned about overbreadth because of the chilling effect that's often undocumented. And the burden is usually on the state to justify a compelling interest rather than the other way around. And so I guess my question for you is it sounds like Minnesota's law is a bit of an outlier compared to most of the country's. There may be nine states or so with -- with a statute that goes this far. Is there any documented need for a statute to go this far as opposed to what happens in most other states, which is limited to electioneering? Okay, 11. Whatever number it is, it's a minority number. And under your interpretation of ""political,"" it would forbid people from wearing certain portions of the Bill of Rights into a polling place but not other portions of the Bill of Rights. And I guess I'm just wondering what compelling interest Minnesota has identified that requires a statute that goes so much further than the vast majority of states? What evidence do we have? What record is there? What facts can you point to? Again, Burson was electioneering, a different statute, and you're asking us to go a step further than Burson. And I'm just wondering what -- what do you have? And if the answer is nothing further than Burson, that's fine; that's an answer. Political speech beyond solicitation for candidates or things on the ballot, right? Okay.

2017,McCoy v. Louisiana,115,Neil Gorsuch,"Well -- But, Mr. Waxman, if we have to draw a line, it seems to me we have at least two axes we have to worry about. One is, where do we stop on the concession? You say it goes down to elements. I -- I -- I press you why it wouldn't go further than that, if the client instructs the lawyer not to accede to admission of a piece of evidence as particularly damning but the lawyer sees no good faith basis for objecting. -- why -- why doesn't it go down to that level? That's one axis. The other axis would be you say it's -- the lawyer can't admit the element. But what if the lawyer casts doubt on the element? I mean, what if the lawyer here hadn't admitted guilt but had presented a mens rea defense that really cast aspersions on the actus reus defense, right, it really cast -- any reasonable person would know what the lawyer is up to. He didn't use the magic words ""I admit,"" but he did, in fact, essentially do that. So we have ambiguity on both these axes. Where would we draw the lines? But sometimes -- sometimes -- sometimes, though, a piece of evidence is far more important than an element. Take -- take the Chief Justice's example of a Hobbs Act. I mean, the interstate commerce element is usually not that big a deal in those cases. But admission of a piece, a letter or, you know, an admission by the defendant is a huge deal. I know. Mr. Waxman, I -- I -- -- think you're right about that, but my question would be -- I'm sorry. On that, it seems to me that that's Faretta, right? That you have a right to control your self-representation if you're unhappy with your lawyer. The -- your client had an opportunity to -- this is on his second lawyer. And he -- he had notice before trial that there was a breakdown with his lawyer. And the trial court ruled he -- he came too late to replace him with a third lawyer yet or to go to self-representation. Why isn't this just an untimely Faretta problem, accepting everything you've said about the original understanding? At some point, one can waive these rights too. These are personal rights that could be waived. Counsel, you've been asking us to review this under Strickland, but why -- why isn't this a structural error? The Sixth Amendment guarantees the assistance of counsel, as Mr. Waxman points out, and that is a fiduciary relationship. And when someone doesn't just admit an element but admits guilt of second-degree murder, which is effectively what happened here, why isn't that structural error, a total denial of assistance of counsel, absence of an assistance of counsel, that we should take cognizance of and draw the line there? Well, why -- why isn't this just like Faretta, where we said, you know, that you have a right to have assistance of counsel and not to have an agent of the state assist the state in prosecuting you? You'd agree, though, that he -- he effectively conceded guilt to second-degree murder? Well, if -- if we're there, though, in Strickland, even in Strickland, on deficient performance, why isn't there at least deficient performance here by the lawyer admitting the element as opposed to remaining mute about it? That would have been an option that I think the lawyer could have pursued. So we'd still have prejudice prong, I understand your arguments there, but why not on deficient performance? I would have thought under the ethical rules, which I know are not controlling here, that you -- you would have had an argument for an ethical violation in conceding your client's guilt. Well, let's take Justice Kagan's hypothetical then on its own terms. What would be the outcome in that case? Let's posit all of that, that we have a competent, rational, thoughtful individual who makes a calculated decision autonomously, that that's the route he or she wishes to go. Is it -- can we even call it assistance of counsel? Is that what it is when a lawyer overrides that person's wishes? ",well but mr waxman if we have to draw a line it seem to me we have at least two axes we have to worry about one be where do we stop on the concession you say it go down to element i i i press you why it would not go far than that if the client instruct the lawyer not to accede to admission of a piece of evidence as particularly damn but the lawyer see no good faith basis for object why why do not it go down to that level that be one axis the other axis would be you say it be the lawyer can not admit the element but what if the lawyer cast doubt on the element i mean what if the lawyer here have not admit guilt but have present a men rea defense that really cast aspersion on the actus reus defense right it really cast any reasonable person would know what the lawyer be up to he do not use the magic word i admit but he do in fact essentially do that so we have ambiguity on both these ax where would we draw the line but sometimes sometimes sometimes though a piece of evidence be far more important than an element take take the chief justice s example of a hobbs act i mean the interstate commerce element be usually not that big a deal in those case but admission of a piece a letter or you know an admission by the defendant be a huge deal i know mr waxman i i think you be right about that but my question would be I be sorry on that it seem to me that that be faretta right that you have a right to control your self representation if you be unhappy with your lawyer the your client have an opportunity to this be on his second lawyer and he he have notice before trial that there be a breakdown with his lawyer and the trial court rule he he come too late to replace him with a third lawyer yet or to go to self representation why be not this just an untimely faretta problem accept everything you have say about the original understanding at some point one can waive these right too these be personal right that could be waive counsel you have be ask us to review this under strickland but why why be not this a structural error the sixth amendment guarantee the assistance of counsel as mr waxman point out and that be a fiduciary relationship and when someone do not just admit an element but admit guilt of second degree murder which be effectively what happen here why be not that structural error a total denial of assistance of counsel absence of an assistance of counsel that we should take cognizance of and draw the line there well why why be not this just like faretta where we say you know that you have a right to have assistance of counsel and not to have an agent of the state assist the state in prosecute you you would agree though that he he effectively concede guilt to second degree murder well if if we be there though in strickland even in strickland on deficient performance why be not there at least deficient performance here by the lawyer admit the element as oppose to remain mute about it that would have be an option that i think the lawyer could have pursue so we would still have prejudice prong i understand your argument there but why not on deficient performance i would have think under the ethical rule which i know be not control here that you you would have have an argument for an ethical violation in concede your client s guilt well let us take justice kagan s hypothetical then on its own term what would be the outcome in that case let us posit all of that that we have a competent rational thoughtful individual who make a calculated decision autonomously that that be the route he or she wish to go be it can we even call it assistance of counsel be that what it be when a lawyer override that person s wish ,232.6,Roberts Court,"Jan 17, 2018",Robert McCoy,State of Louisiana,16-8255,"Sep 28, 2017","May 14, 2018",115.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2017,Benisek v. Lamone,115,Neil Gorsuch,"Counsel -- Counsel, one question I have about causation for you. Before the district court, it appeared that you conceded that you had to prove but-for causation, that but for the alleged gerrymander, the outcome would have been different in these last three elections. And the district court expressly rejected a lower standard, rejecting some metaphysical could-be burden in favor of the but-for cause test. In this Court, you seem to now be backing away from the but-for cause requirement, as best I can tell, in favor of something the district court might have described differently. And I wonder how could it be an abuse of discretion for the district court to have proceeded on the basis of a concession before it that you're now backing away from? I understand that. But before the district court, you took the position that you had to prove it, according to the district court's opinion. According to -- your brief is saying our burden is to show. Right. So the district court twisted your concession? No. What it said was -- it didn't say that. So I think you're twisting perhaps what the district court said. What the district court quoted you as saying is our burden is to show that purposeful dilution was a but-for cause of the losses in 2012, '14, and '16. All right. How can it be an abuse of discretion for the district court to have relied on that concession? One more along these lines for you. In Factual Findings 11 and 12, the district court found that plaintiffs had -- had conducted no statistical sampling to show an alternative cause might not have been responsible; namely, that people just preferred the candidate. And it had nothing to do with gerrymandering. How do we -- how do we address that factual finding and call it an abuse of discretion, the decision here, when plaintiffs failed to rule out other potential causal factors for the results here? Along the lines of things we don't know, we've been talking about the intent of the legislature, but what effect does the -- does the fact that this map was subsequently approved by the people themselves have when we're trying to determine intent? This went up for voter referendum, as I understand it -- -- and passed with 64 or so percent of the vote. ",counsel counsel one question i have about causation for you before the district court it appear that you concede that you have to prove but for causation that but for the alleged gerrymander the outcome would have be different in these last three election and the district court expressly reject a low standard reject some metaphysical could be burden in favor of the but for because test in this court you seem to now be back away from the but for because requirement as best i can tell in favor of something the district court might have describe differently and i wonder how could it be an abuse of discretion for the district court to have proceed on the basis of a concession before it that you be now back away from i understand that but before the district court you take the position that you have to prove it accord to the district court s opinion accord to your brief be say our burden be to show right so the district court twist your concession no what it say be it do not say that so i think you be twist perhaps what the district court say what the district court quote you as say be our burden be to show that purposeful dilution be a but for because of the loss in and all right how can it be an abuse of discretion for the district court to have rely on that concession one more along these line for you in factual finding and the district court find that plaintiff have have conduct no statistical sampling to show an alternative because might not have be responsible namely that people just prefer the candidate and it have nothing to do with gerrymandering how do we how do we address that factual finding and call it an abuse of discretion the decision here when plaintiff fail to rule out other potential causal factor for the result here along the line of thing we do not know we have be talk about the intent of the legislature but what effect do the do the fact that this map be subsequently approve by the people themselves have when we be try to determine intent this go up for voter referendum as i understand it and pass with or so percent of the vote ,132.4,Roberts Court,"Mar 28, 2018",,,17-333,"Dec 8, 2017","Jun 18, 2018",115.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2017,Ayestas v. Davis,115,Neil Gorsuch,"I have a separate jurisdictional problem that I'm hoping you can help me with and it concerns the COA requirement. And neither side discusses it, but it's jurisdictional, so I'm -- I feel like I should give you a shot at it and you can help me out with it. The Fifth Circuit didn't require a COA because it read Harbison as saying one wasn't required. But some circuits, including my old one, have distinguished Harbison in similar circumstances, pointing out that Harbison just dealt with the appointment, I believe, of clemency counsel, and the issue wasn't part of the final order in the merits of the habeas petition. Here, the denial of funding was part of the final order in the denial of a habeas petition. And as I read 2253, a final order in a habeas proceeding, you need a COA. Now, maybe you can say it's just independent and totally separate from that. But then that might suggest you'd have to -- you'd be able to appeal as a matter of right anytime a funding denial takes place, even before a final judgment. And that seems odd too, though, because funding requests, attorney fee denials, sanctions, usually are wrapped up in and merged with the final judgment. So, long-winded question, but it's jurisdictional, so -- and I thought you could help me out with that. Sure. But you're appealing the final order in a habeas proceeding, and that's the language in 2253. So help me out with the language in 2253. Final order? In -- in -- in a habeas proceeding, right? So -- so it's like a Cohen issue, you'd say, and we have collateral -- you know, it's a collateral issue and so we can take it up before a final judgment in -- in the habeas proceeding? I've never heard of this animal before. It's collateral, but it still merges to the final order? Well -- Deny a hear -- evidentiary hearing or a discovery ruling, it all merges into the final order, traditionally. That's my understanding. Sure. I would too. You're okay with that? (Laughter.) You're okay with that? You like that proposal -- Justice Breyer's proposal? Okay. All right. Counsel, you say there was no deficient performance, but the circuit court had to amend its -- its ruling because it had mistakenly said that there had been an investigation of mental health in 1997 by trial counsel, and it had to withdraw that. Is there -- is it fair to say there was no deficient performance or a holding on that score by the Fifth Circuit after -- after it reissued its opinion? Or did it rely solely on prejudice at least with respect to trial counsel? How? But -- but -- that's contacting the family members. And I'll spot you that. But I'm talking about the mental health issue. How can -- how can there have been no deficient performance holding if it withdrew the basis of that holding in its -- in its revised opinion? Yeah. What do -- Yeah. What do we do about that? On the one hand, it's jurisdictional. On the other hand, it's not in the question presented. So, as Justice Breyer said, maybe we should let the court of appeals deal with that in the first instance. That's usually pretty reliable, too. ",i have a separate jurisdictional problem that I be hop you can help me with and it concern the coa requirement and neither side discuss it but it be jurisdictional so I be i feel like i should give you a shot at it and you can help me out with it the fifth circuit do not require a coa because it read harbison as say one be not require but some circuit include my old one have distinguish harbison in similar circumstance point out that harbison just dealt with the appointment i believe of clemency counsel and the issue be not part of the final order in the merit of the habeas petition here the denial of funding be part of the final order in the denial of a habeas petition and as i read a final order in a habeas proceeding you need a coa now maybe you can say it be just independent and totally separate from that but then that might suggest you would have to you would be able to appeal as a matter of right anytime a funding denial take place even before a final judgment and that seem odd too though because funding request attorney fee denial sanction usually be wrap up in and merge with the final judgment so long winded question but it be jurisdictional so and i think you could help me out with that sure but you be appeal the final order in a habeas proceeding and that be the language in so help me out with the language in final order in in in a habeas proceeding right so so it be like a cohen issue you would say and we have collateral you know it be a collateral issue and so we can take it up before a final judgment in in the habeas proceeding I have never hear of this animal before it be collateral but it still merge to the final order well deny a hear evidentiary hearing or a discovery ruling it all merge into the final order traditionally that be my understanding sure i would too you be okay with that laughter you be okay with that you like that proposal justice breyer s proposal okay all right counsel you say there be no deficient performance but the circuit court have to amend its its ruling because it have mistakenly say that there have be an investigation of mental health in by trial counsel and it have to withdraw that be there be it fair to say there be no deficient performance or a hold on that score by the fifth circuit after after it reissue its opinion or do it rely solely on prejudice at least with respect to trial counsel how but but that be contact the family member and I will spot you that but I be talk about the mental health issue how can how can there have be no deficient performance hold if it withdraw the basis of that hold in its in its revise opinion yeah what do yeah what do we do about that on the one hand it be jurisdictional on the other hand it be not in the question present so as justice breyer say maybe we should let the court of appeal deal with that in the first instance that be usually pretty reliable too ,171.36,Roberts Court,"Oct 30, 2017",Carlos Manuel Ayestas,"Lorie Davis, Director, Texas Department of Criminal Justice (Institutional Division)",16-6795,"Apr 3, 2017","Mar 21, 2018",115.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

2017,Patchak v. Zinke,115,Neil Gorsuch,"But, Mr. -- So, Mr. Gant, it's that last clause -- So, Mr. Gant, if I understand it, the answer to the question, I think, is that last clause, the dismiss -- ordering the courts to dismiss the claim, that up to that point, ""shall not be filed or maintained,"" if that's jurisdictional, as I understand, you and your amici are okay with that. It's the directing the dismissal. But if that -- if that's the only beef we have, is that really a beef at all because that's a natural consequence of a jurisdiction-stripping statute as McCardle itself, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, right, so there's nothing left. I think it's almost a virtual quote from McCardle, right, there's nothing left to be done but dismiss. So where is the real beef here? Assume -- assuming it's jurisdictional and all you're left with is this complaint about the last clause, why should we care? Well, Ms. O'Connell, it seems to me like a lot hinges on whether this is jurisdictional or not in response to all of these questions. And this Court in recent years has instructed that we're not going to lightly assume Congress is stripping jurisdiction. We need a clear statement, Arbaugh, Sebelius, and whatever might have been permissible before, Congress is now on notice that it needs to provide a clear rule. And this statute comes after those warnings from this Court. And help me understand why this statute is, in fact, jurisdiction-stripping without reference to old past laws but after Sebelius, after Arbaugh? Right. You can't. Right. Keene. Right. But you've also got Reed Elsevier, which has similar language to this. No -- basically, no claim shall be maintained, or something like that, that we held wasn't jurisdictional, in the copyright statute. Parties file things. That could be a claims processing rule too. Right? You don't file it. Let's say -- let's say it isn't jurisdictional. Let's say -- let's say we're going to stick with our clear statement rule and that we find this non-jurisdictional. Don't we then have a real problem because a dismissal would be not 12(b)(1) but 12(b)(6), it would be on the merits and have collateral consequences? And wouldn't that be a real problem for Article III? I'm asking -- I'm asking you to put that aside in this question. I'm asking you to -- again, assuming this isn't jurisdictional, for purposes of this question, wouldn't we have a real problem because you are directing dismissal and dismissal wouldn't be 12(b)(1), it would be 12(b)(6), and that has collateral consequences potentially.

But then (b)(2) with respect to special verdicts doesn't contain any parallel language like that and, in fact, suggests that the judgment has to be entered promptly. What do we do about that? But as I understood your answer to Justice Kagan and -- and Justice Ginsburg, it was one of the reasons we don't need to worry about your proposed rule is that the district court has discretion to delay the entry of judgment and that that is textually found in (b)(1), which, indeed, it is with respect to general verdicts, but there's no parallel language that you can rely on with respect to (b)(2). And does that diminish your argument by suggesting there the district court doesn't have jurisdiction -- discretion to delay the entry of judgment? Why not? Why doesn't it? Now, that's where I get stuck. If we have a district court that issues separate judgments, I think pretty much any cautious litigator would take that seriously and file a notice of appeal because it's a signal from the district court that it is complete. It is finished. There is a final decision in this matter. I've read it and it's ambiguous. It doesn't say they are merged. It doesn't use that word. It doesn't say for all purposes. And then we have, as the Chief Justice points out, a later order from the same district court, which I assume we would take as seriously as a consolidation order, it being a final judgment and all. So help me out with that. Mr. Katyal, on 54, where I get tripped up is the word ""action."" 54 speaks of sending upstairs a claim within an -- within an action. And the federal rules consistently understand the word ""action"" to be the complaint, the lawsuit. In fact, even this rule that we're now interpreting speaks of actions. Rule 2, Rule 3. So it seems to me that your dependence on 54 runs into a bit of a plain language issue. Do you have any -- do you have any answer on the text of action, though? Do you know anywhere else in -- in the rules where ""action"" is used differently? No, I'm -- I'm just asking whether you're familiar with any other place in the rules. Wouldn't it be clearer if it were in the rules rather than in the case law which is currently so split? Well, the reason that we took this case is because there is a split. ",well counsel for the for the court of appeal that prefer the practice of defer everything until there be a final judgment on a final matter in the district court could they just have a rule a local rule or practice of defer case along the line that we have just discuss no I be talk about for case just like this if if we be in a circuit that prefer as a matter of practice to wait until everything be do be there anything inhibit them from adopt a rule stay case where there be another related matter still lurk in the district court i can not see any and it be not this be not an unfriendly question well but counsel that be what it say i think in b with respect to general verdict but then b with respect to special verdict do not contain any parallel language like that and in fact suggest that the judgment have to be enter promptly what do we do about that but as i understand your answer to justice kagan and and justice ginsburg it be one of the reason we do not need to worry about your propose rule be that the district court have discretion to delay the entry of judgment and that that be textually find in b which indeed it be with respect to general verdict but there be no parallel language that you can rely on with respect to b and do that diminish your argument by suggest there the district court do not have jurisdiction discretion to delay the entry of judgment why not why do not it now that be where i get stick if we have a district court that issue separate judgment i think pretty much any cautious litigator would take that seriously and file a notice of appeal because it be a signal from the district court that it be complete it be finish there be a final decision in this matter I have read it and it be ambiguous it do not say they be merge it do not use that word it do not say for all purpose and then we have as the chief justice point out a late order from the same district court which i assume we would take as seriously as a consolidation order it be a final judgment and all so help me out with that mr katyal on where i get trip up be the word action speaks of send upstairs a claim within an within an action and the federal rule consistently understand the word action to be the complaint the lawsuit in fact even this rule that we be now interpret speaks of action rule rule so it seem to me that your dependence on run into a bit of a plain language issue do you have any do you have any answer on the text of action though do you know anywhere else in in the rule where action be use differently no I be I be just ask whether you be familiar with any other place in the rule would not it be clear if it we be in the rule rather than in the case law which be currently so split well the reason that we take this case be because there be a split ,175.75999999999996,Roberts Court,"Jan 16, 2018","Elsa Hall, as Personal Representative of the Estate of Ethlyn Louise Hall and as Successor Trustee of the Ethlyn Louise Hall Family Trust","Samuel H.

And maybe I'm mistaken in that, but because perhaps the furniture situation one should understand would be less in this area of town than that area of town. But if it's a new tenant, we all live with folding chairs for a period of time when we move. So does that hold? Is that a fair reason? Should officers really have to distinguish between parts of town in deciding when to make an arrest? Right. The commonsense perspective is it's a new tenant. And so the new tenant, we all live -- if I work with boxes, and whatever part of town we're from. So does an officer -- should an officer, I mean, redline where he enforces the law? Take away the for sale sign. We don't have that here. That's not a fact we have. But otherwise pretty much the same, right? But you say it's okay to arrest at the mansion and not here?

2017,Sveen v. Melin,115,Neil Gorsuch,"Well, I think, counsel, Justice Ginsburg's question goes to the -- the weighing that some of our cases suggest that we have to do in this -- these cases. And if you concede, as I believe you have, that Minnesota could achieve everything it wants to achieve by prospectively applying this law and then retroactively or -- ordering courts to make sure that this issue is dealt with in divorce decrees, how does that inform our analysis as to the legitimacy and need for overriding contracts in these cases? Prospectively, though, you acknowledge it could have achieved all it wants to achieve? And, retroactively, it could have done as Justice Ginsburg suggests and told divorce courts that this is a matter that they'd have to take up. So how is it that they wouldn't be able to achieve all that they wanted to achieve? But your answer for Contract Clause purposes would be the same? Based on the decree rather than the contract? But, counsel -- counsel, do we know that the -- the dead husband here didn't, as part of the divorce, wish this asset to remain with his -- with his ex-wife? Sometimes that is part of a divorce arrangement, that certain assets stay with the spouse. Is there any indication in this record at all that the decedent wished this asset to go anywhere else? Does anyone pay life insurance for the joy of paying life insurance? Isn't the specification of the beneficiary pretty important? I mean, Justice Washington in Dartmouth College said, you know, the bounty of a contract is -- is -- is essential to the obligation. Well, what -- what if it didn't go to his contingent beneficiaries? Then what? Let's say the statute said it -- it goes to a charity or -- or, instead of the children, some -- some nice thing for children. Would that be a Contract Clause violation? And if not, why not? No, no, no, no, no, not so easy. (Laughter.) Would that be a Contract Clause violation? Surely you've given some thought to that. So the state says, contract, we don't care about your primary or your contingent beneficiary. The money goes to the state. The Constitution of the United States says that a state cannot impair the obligations of a contract. And -- and you don't think we have a problem? No, no, no, no, a Contract Clause. No, I'm asking you about Contract Clause violation. You'd say that's no Contract Clause violation. There's no impairment of an obligation in that case. No, no, the statute just says it goes to the -- goes to wherever, to the state, a nice charitable organization we'd all agree on that most people would support, if not everybody, most people, just like most people would want to change their beneficiary here. That there's no impairment of an obligation in that case? They also talked about remedies, right, as being distinct from obligations, didn't they? The recording statutes meant -- merely said that your -- your remedy would be different if you didn't record, right? They have to write a letter. Somebody has to write a letter. Okay. (Laughter.) I think we've established that. Hopefully, they read -- Either that or the state statute. Okay. My -- my question for you, though, I want to pick up where Justice Breyer left off, and that's recording statutes. What do we do about those? This Court has long held that those are fine and -- even though they pose some limits on -- on contracting. And -- and your colleague on the other side suggested that the best line we draw is how substantial the impairment is. This Court has approved recording statutes as an impairment. What do we do about those? But isn't that because Justice Marshall also said that marriage contracts are not within the cognizance of the Contract Clause? And I don't think anyone disputes that life insurance policies are within the cognizance of the Contract Clause, or -- or do you? Because marriage contracts are not within the cognizance of the clause. Right? ",well i think counsel justice ginsburg s question go to the the weighing that some of our case suggest that we have to do in this these case and if you concede as i believe you have that minnesota could achieve everything it want to achieve by prospectively apply this law and then retroactively or order court to make sure that this issue be deal with in divorce decree how do that inform our analysis as to the legitimacy and need for override contract in these case prospectively though you acknowledge it could have achieve all it want to achieve and retroactively it could have do as justice ginsburg suggest and tell divorce court that this be a matter that they would have to take up so how be it that they would not be able to achieve all that they want to achieve but your answer for contract clause purpose would be the same base on the decree rather than the contract but counsel counsel do we know that the the dead husband here do not as part of the divorce wish this asset to remain with his with his ex wife sometimes that be part of a divorce arrangement that certain asset stay with the spouse be there any indication in this record at all that the decedent wish this asset to go anywhere else do anyone pay life insurance for the joy of pay life insurance be not the specification of the beneficiary pretty important i mean justice washington in dartmouth college say you know the bounty of a contract be be be essential to the obligation well what what if it do not go to his contingent beneficiary then what let us say the statute say it it go to a charity or or instead of the child some some nice thing for child would that be a contract clause violation and if not why not no no no no no not so easy laughter would that be a contract clause violation surely you have give some thought to that so the state say contract we do not care about your primary or your contingent beneficiary the money go to the state the constitution of the united state say that a state can not impair the obligation of a contract and and you do not think we have a problem no no no no a contract clause no I be ask you about contract clause violation you would say that be no contract clause violation there be no impairment of an obligation in that case no no the statute just say it go to the go to wherever to the state a nice charitable organization we would all agree on that most people would support if not everybody most people just like most people would want to change their beneficiary here that there be no impairment of an obligation in that case they also talk about remedy right as be distinct from obligation do not they the recording statute mean merely say that your your remedy would be different if you do not record right they have to write a letter somebody have to write a letter okay laughter i think we have establish that hopefully they read either that or the state statute okay my my question for you though i want to pick up where justice breyer leave off and that be record statute what do we do about those this court have long hold that those be fine and even though they pose some limit on on contracting and and your colleague on the other side suggest that the best line we draw be how substantial the impairment be this court have approve record statute as an impairment what do we do about those but be not that because justice marshall also say that marriage contract be not within the cognizance of the contract clause and i do not think anyone dispute that life insurance policy be within the cognizance of the contract clause or or do you because marriage contract be not within the cognizance of the clause right ,229.14,Roberts Court,"Mar 19, 2018","Ashley Sveen, et al.","Kaye Melin, et al.",16-1432,"Dec 8, 2017","Jun 11, 2018",115.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2017,Upper Skagit Indian Tribe v. Lundgren,115,Neil Gorsuch,"Counsel -- Counsel -- counsel, along those lines, do you think you'd have a stronger case if the land had been taken into trust? And the land is purchased, as I understand it, in 2013. I'm curious why it hasn't been taken into trust. Go ahead. Why -- why doesn't -- why doesn't it make a difference whether the land is held in trust or not? I guess I'd like an answer to my question, though. Why -- why should it make a difference whether it's in trust or not? But if -- if it were in trust, then we would treat it as the land of the separate sovereign, right? It would be -- -- the tribe's land, just as it might be France, now it's -- it's -- it's titled under the state's laws and is still part of the state. Does that -- does that resonate with you at all? And if that doesn't make sense, tell me why not. Ms. O'Connell, I -- I have been hoping to hear from you about what the baseline rule was versus the exceptions. And I'm still hopeful we might get an answer to that question. Why do you -- and what's your best authority for the proposition that the baseline rule of common law was total immunity, including in rem actions? MS. O'CONNELL: I -- I think it's the Federalist Papers, the Hamilton quote from the Federalist Papers. Also, Schooner Exchange versus McFaddon lays that out as a general rule for foreign states at least. But, again, I think that one important point that I want to get out here is that if Congress were to look at this and -- and decide whether to create a judicial -- or a statutory exception for tribal sovereign immunity, it may very well make decisions like it made with respect to the United States about a statute of limitations or exceptions for adverse possession claims or things that Congress is in a position to weigh and create a comprehensive solution. I think there would be -- CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. O'Connell,one -- there was one sentence in your brief that really leapt off the page, for me anyway. It's the one between pages 23 and 24 where you say the Respondents, the Lundgrens, you're asking, well, what alternatives do they have? And you say the Lundgrens could, for example, log trees on the disputed strip, commence building a structure, or take other similar actions that would induce Petitioner to file suit. Is that really what you want them to do? There's a dispute about this piece of property and you say: Well, go pick a fight. Go cut down some trees. What difference -- what difference would that make? Let's say the land were in title. How should that affect our analysis, if at all? If the land were -- Yeah. Let's say -- let's say the land -- this land were in -- were in trust. Then what? Why should that make any difference? But, counsel, Justice Ginsburg's question, I -- I really would appreciate an answer to that because it troubles me too. The State of Washington relied on this Court's decision in Yakima and said that there was no impediment to suit. But Yakima, of course, was just an interpretation of the General Allotment Act and had nothing to do with in rem authority writ large, and I didn't see anything in your brief defending the reasoning of the Washington Supreme Court and its analysis of Yakima. So can we just put that aside and agree that that was wrong and then move on to the arguments you've really pressed in your brief? Okay, all right. That's -- that -- I appreciate that concession. But -- fine. But you agree that Yakima doesn't control? Okay. All right. And in that case, why isn't it enough for the day for this Court to resolve a split of authority over whether Yakima controls in cases like this and return it to the Washington Supreme Court, where you can present all these wonderful arguments you've raised here for the first time? No, I -- I understand that. I spot you all of that. My question, though, remains, you've raised a new ground for defending the result below and abandoned the ground that was actually asserted. This Court doesn't normally resolve questions like that in the first instance. Normally, it's a question of review, not first view. Why shouldn't we exercise discretion here and wait? Well, but you -- that's not quite right, though, because we know the United States would be immune from this suit, right? Well, adverse possession, I think we -- everyone acknowledges that the United States would not be subject to a suit like that. Maybe you can tell me why that's wrong in response to Justice Ginsburg's line of inquiry. But it -- assuming it -- it could be immune, here, if the land were in trust, it would be the same as the United States' land. And so it is possible that a sovereign could be immune from this kind of suit, right? I -- I understand. But if this were in trust and, therefore, property of the United States, you'd agree sovereign immunity would bar this suit? ",counsel counsel counsel along those line do you think you would have a strong case if the land have be take into trust and the land be purchase as i understand it in I be curious why it have not be take into trust go ahead why why do not why do not it make a difference whether the land be hold in trust or not i guess I would like an answer to my question though why why should it make a difference whether it be in trust or not but if if it we be in trust then we would treat it as the land of the separate sovereign right it would be the tribe s land just as it might be france now it be it be it be title under the state s law and be still part of the state do that do that resonate with you at all and if that do not make sense tell me why not ms oconnell i i have be hop to hear from you about what the baseline rule be versus the exception and I be still hopeful we might get an answer to that question why do you and what be your best authority for the proposition that the baseline rule of common law be total immunity include in rem action ms oconnell i i think it be the federalist paper the hamilton quote from the federalist paper also schooner exchange versus mcfaddon lay that out as a general rule for foreign state at least but again i think that one important point that i want to get out here be that if congress we be to look at this and and decide whether to create a judicial or a statutory exception for tribal sovereign immunity it may very well make decision like it make with respect to the united state about a statute of limitation or exception for adverse possession claim or thing that congress be in a position to weigh and create a comprehensive solution i think there would be chief justice robert ms oconnell one there be one sentence in your brief that really leap off the page for me anyway it be the one between page and where you say the respondent the lundgrens you be ask well what alternative do they have and you say the lundgrens could for example log tree on the disputed strip commence build a structure or take other similar action that would induce petitioner to file suit be that really what you want them to do there be a dispute about this piece of property and you say well go pick a fight go cut down some tree what difference what difference would that make let us say the land we be in title how should that affect our analysis if at all if the land we be yeah let us say let us say the land this land we be in we be in trust then what why should that make any difference but counsel justice ginsburg s question i i really would appreciate an answer to that because it trouble me too the state of washington rely on this court s decision in yakima and say that there be no impediment to suit but yakima of course be just an interpretation of the general allotment act and have nothing to do with in rem authority writ large and i do not see anything in your brief defend the reasoning of the washington supreme court and its analysis of yakima so can we just put that aside and agree that that be wrong and then move on to the argument you have really press in your brief okay all right that be that i appreciate that concession but fine but you agree that yakima do not control okay all right and in that case why be not it enough for the day for this court to resolve a split of authority over whether yakima control in case like this and return it to the washington supreme court where you can present all these wonderful argument you have raise here for the first time no i i understand that i spot you all of that my question though remain you have raise a new ground for defend the result below and abandon the ground that be actually assert this court do not normally resolve question like that in the first instance normally it be a question of review not first view why should not we exercise discretion here and wait well but you that be not quite right though because we know the united state would be immune from this suit right well adverse possession i think we everyone acknowledge that the united state would not be subject to a suit like that maybe you can tell me why that be wrong in response to justice ginsburg s line of inquiry but it assume it it could be immune here if the land we be in trust it would be the same as the united state land and so it be possible that a sovereign could be immune from this kind of suit right i i understand but if this we be in trust and therefore property of the united state you would agree sovereign immunity would bar this suit ,278.0,Roberts Court,"Mar 21, 2018",Upper Skagit Indian Tribe,"Sharline Lundgren, et vir",17-387,"Dec 8, 2017","May 21, 2018",115.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

But if Congress's concern is that creditors are soliciting information that's incomplete about debts, liabilities, that's just half of the balance sheet that you want us to look at. So Congress appears to have been concerned, to the extent we can tell these things, about misstatements only with respect to one-half of overall financial condition. Right? Good. How? Right. No, I understand that, but the concern is that the misstatements were with respect to omitted liabilities, right? But doesn't that show that an omitted liability, one asset or lack -- or one debt, can reflect on the overall financial condition, that can be about and relevant to and reflect on the overall financial condition? Well, Congress thought -- thought it could be about, didn't it? But if you make a major representation about the absence of an overwhelming debt or the presence of an overwhelming asset, why can't that reflect on, be about, your overall financial condition? I own a genuine Vermeer. Ever? Categorically? All right. Let's say I don't -- Let's say I don't accept that. Yeah. What's your second answer? Why isn't it exactly like the genuine Vermeer? All right? The law firm's chasing the client and -- and the client says: Okay, okay, okay, I'm late in paying, I know I'm terribly late in paying, but I have this tax refund coming. I have the genuine Vermeer almost in my possession. Right? Why isn't that -- why -- why isn't everyone in the room understanding exactly what that means, which is, okay, I don't have a lot else, but I've got this. Well -- well, that -- that's a problem for me too, and maybe you can help me out with that, is the insolvency definitions in --- in the tax code, at least for municipalities -- -- ""financial condition"" is defined as the ability to meet your current debts as they come due. Well, let's -- let's take Mr. Garre's example of the Harvard Business School graduate. I graduated from Harvard Business School. And someone might reasonably rely on that and take it to be material and significant. But does it relate to financial condition, overall financial condition? Doesn't that term have to mean something? Okay. All right. So you'd rule it out on the basis that it has a to be at least something that would appear on a financial statement. All right. A lot of trivial things appear on financial statements, right? I have this, that, little asset. I own a car. It's a secondhand car. It's not worth a whole lot, but it would appear on a financial statement. That would be enough in your -- under your rule? Well, no, no, it was reasonably relied on for the purpose of the loan or the services rendered or whatever, as collateral, surely, of course, it was. But it doesn't have anything to do with overall financial condition. It just means I own a very bad car. Your -- your test -- I'm sorry, please. Following up on -- sorry. We've been focusing on the balance sheet, and that's where your focus has been. Is it an asset? Would it appear on a financial statement? But what about an income statement or a representation about a future stream of income that wouldn't appear on a balance statement but might appear on an in -- income statement? I understood there to be a little daylight between your -- your position and your colleagues' on that. Well, but you talked about assets or liabilities.

And yet here we're being asked to decide what the right standard of review is. Can we do that with any degree of assurance when we don't know what the right legal test is? And -- and don't we run the risk, perhaps, of sending the wrong signal to lower courts that we're adopting the Ninth Circuit or endorsing the Ninth Circuit's formulation of what the test is? This seems to me a high degree of difficulty. It's like one of those high dives, you know, it's a -- it's a 10 out of 10 difficulty. Well, you know, I went and I had a law clerk survey that for me and I've looked at it and I'm not sure I entirely agree. So help -- give me some comfort on that, because I look at like the Fourth Circuit, for example, and they talk about sufficient authority. A closeness, they're really focused on the closeness aspect of it. And then I look at others and they focus more on the arm's length. And I agree those are two important factors, but the degree of attention given really does seem very different across the circuits. So it doesn't turn on closeness then? So we're not sure about that? The totality analysis of the arm's length? So the test isn't closeness or arm's length; it's totality? So it's arm's length? Okay. But that's not what the Ninth Circuit says. Both. Should we wait to see what the courts of appeals sort out on all this before we decide what the standard of review is? But -- But isn't Justice Sotomayor correct that in a lot of areas we presume that based on the status of the individual involved or the relationship and we don't make an inquiry into the nature of the transaction at all? So why -- So why couldn't that also be a possible test for those who aren't listed in the statute, assuming such a class of persons exists? Which we haven't decided either, right? Would it -- Would it be nice to resolve that question first before deciding what the standard of review is? I mean, the government's brief, I think, admirably points out, and I couldn't agree more, that determining the ""standard of review thus requires precise identification of the particular question raised on appeal."" But -- But as we've discussed, if it depends upon status, that might be a legal-looking question. If it depends on arm's length, that might be a more factual-looking question. And we haven't resolved the relationship between those two or, in fact, whether both of them are appropriate considerations. And you think the test is wrong. And -- and we didn't take that question. That's on us. Should -- should we even attempt to answer the question, though, without -- of the standard of review without first defining, as the -- as the government put it, the ""precise identification of the particular question raised on appeal?"" So you don't care. Whatever the test is, is always going to be de novo review? Always. Okay. Assume I don't buy that. Then what should I do? Then -- then do you want me to dig the case? ",counsel could we back up to where justice sotomayor start us off this morning and that be she point out that oftentimes insider status be determine on the basis of the closeness of the relationship without respect to the arm s length nature of the transaction that that be just presume the ninth circuit have develop this two part test and near as i can tell it be conjunctive you require both closeness and lack of arm s length other circuit have different verbal formulation and some have not even weigh in some have not even weigh in on the question whether there be such thing as a non statutory insider right and yet here we be be ask to decide what the right standard of review be can we do that with any degree of assurance when we do not know what the right legal test be and and do not we run the risk perhaps of send the wrong signal to lower court that we be adopt the ninth circuit or endorse the ninth circuit s formulation of what the test be this seem to me a high degree of difficulty it be like one of those high dive you know it be a it be a out of difficulty well you know i go and i have a law clerk survey that for me and I have look at it and I be not sure i entirely agree so help give me some comfort on that because i look at like the fourth circuit for example and they talk about sufficient authority a closeness they be really focus on the closeness aspect of it and then i look at others and they focus more on the arm s length and i agree those be two important factor but the degree of attention give really do seem very different across the circuit so it do not turn on closeness then so we be not sure about that the totality analysis of the arm s length so the test be not closeness or arm s length it be totality so it be arm s length okay but that be not what the ninth circuit say both should we wait to see what the court of appeal sort out on all this before we decide what the standard of review be but but be not justice sotomayor correct that in a lot of area we presume that base on the status of the individual involve or the relationship and we do not make an inquiry into the nature of the transaction at all so why so why could not that also be a possible test for those who be not list in the statute assume such a class of person exists which we have not decide either right would it would it be nice to resolve that question first before decide what the standard of review be i mean the government s brief i think admirably point out and i could not agree more that determine the standard of review thus require precise identification of the particular question raise on appeal but but as we have discuss if it depend upon status that might be a legal look question if it depend on arm s length that might be a more factual look question and we have not resolve the relationship between those two or in fact whether both of them be appropriate consideration and you think the test be wrong and and we do not take that question that be on us should should we even attempt to answer the question though without of the standard of review without first defining as the as the government put it the precise identification of the particular question raise on appeal so you do not care whatever the test be be always go to be de novo review always okay assume i do not buy that then what should i do then then do you want me to dig the case ,192.24000000000004,Roberts Court,"Oct 31, 2017",U.S. Bank National Association,"Village at Lakeridge, LLC",15-1509,"Mar 27, 2017","Mar 5, 2018",115.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2017,WesternGeco LLC v. ION Geophysical Corp.,115,Neil Gorsuch,"Well, Mr. -- Mr. Clement, though, the difference I wonder -- and I don't know, but I wonder -- might be this: That, as Justice Ginsburg indicated under 271(f), fine, you get royalties because it's as if the -- the bits were manufactured here. But you don't have a -- a monopoly, a lawful monopoly, to use this technology abroad. That doesn't belong to you. That's outside the patent laws. And so why would you get lost profits by -- because of a third party's use entirely abroad? That -- the lost profits aspect of the damages is the bit that concerns me. And the difference with the common law rule, for example, might be because of the patent law's territorial limits. Well, let's -- let's just segregate out again the -- the royalties, put those aside, okay? And just -- just focus on the profits for me, okay? And they arise from a third party's use over which you have no lawful monopoly. Your patent doesn't run to the high seas, and so your uses aren't protected there. So help me out with that portion of the damages alone. This Court -- this -- All right. Well, here's the -- here's the degree of my skepticism. I -- I have yet to see a case from this Court at least where -- even under 271(a) where the manufacture entirely takes place here, third-party uses abroad give rise to lost profit damages. In passing. The Court doesn't even address the issue. We -- we use the word ""Canadian."" That's all we've got. So what -- Right. I -- I -- I hear that, but -- but the -- to the extent we're talking about the injury here and the poor French Ambassador, I -- I get that we're -- we're supposed to treat the manufacturer as if it took place here, but how do we pretend that the use on the high seas took place in Lake Michigan? That's where I'm struggling and I -- I could still use your help. I -- the high seas and Lake Michigan are -- are just not the same to me. Help -- help -- help me out with just the language of the statute. You say it's obvious from the language of the statute. What -- what -- what would you point me to? What's your best textual argument to show me that the -- the use on the high seas is to be treated as if it took place in Lake Michigan? So -- so just to follow up on this, would you -- would you agree that the -- that the other alternative creates a potential incongruity? Because, if we were to rely on 271(f), we might be in a situation where we're permitting greater damages for someone who only partially manufactured, only partially completed the -- the patent infringement in this country, as compared to someone under (a), who did the entire act here. ",well mr mr clement though the difference i wonder and i do not know but i wonder might be this that as justice ginsburg indicate under f fine you get royalty because it be as if the the bit we be manufacture here but you do not have a a monopoly a lawful monopoly to use this technology abroad that do not belong to you that be outside the patent law and so why would you get lose profit by because of a third party s use entirely abroad that the lost profit aspect of the damage be the bit that concern me and the difference with the common law rule for example might be because of the patent law s territorial limit well let us let us just segregate out again the the royalty put those aside okay and just just focus on the profit for me okay and they arise from a third party s use over which you have no lawful monopoly your patent do not run to the high sea and so your us be not protect there so help me out with that portion of the damage alone this court this all right well here s the here s the degree of my skepticism i i have yet to see a case from this court at least where even under a where the manufacture entirely take place here third party us abroad give rise to lose profit damage in passing the court do not even address the issue we we use the word canadian that be all we have get so what right i i i hear that but but the to the extent we be talk about the injury here and the poor french ambassador i i get that we be we be suppose to treat the manufacturer as if it take place here but how do we pretend that the use on the high sea take place in lake michigan that be where I be struggle and i i could still use your help i the high sea and lake michigan be be just not the same to me help help help me out with just the language of the statute you say it be obvious from the language of the statute what what what would you point me to what be your best textual argument to show me that the the use on the high sea be to be treat as if it take place in lake michigan so so just to follow up on this would you would you agree that the that the other alternative create a potential incongruity because if we we be to rely on f we might be in a situation where we be permit great damage for someone who only partially manufacture only partially complete the the patent infringement in this country as compare to someone under a who do the entire act here ,162.68,Roberts Court,"Apr 16, 2018",WesternGeco LLC,ION Geophysical Corporation,16-1011,"Jan 12, 2018","Jun 22, 2018",115.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2017,Lagos v. United States,115,Neil Gorsuch,"Well, what about hiring a lawyer to be a witness in a governmental investigation? Would that be covered in your view? Counsel, you say that the bankruptcy was a proceeding related to the offense because fraud was at issue there too. And -- and maybe this is a clearer-cut case, but there are going to be plenty where the reasons for the bankruptcy are going to be in dispute, and we're going to invite district judges to engage in long collateral proceedings over whether something is or isn't related enough to the offense. What do we do about that? And, relatedly, you know, this statute covers a lot of different kinds of crimes, including violent crimes. So I -- I can imagine someone saying: My divorce proceedings are related to the crime of violence, and I should get my attorneys' fees for my divorce proceeding too, and -- and child care and all the other things Justice Breyer enumerated. Where -- where is the stopping point here? Well, I mean, this is a civil bankruptcy proceeding. That's not very narrow. And I don't see how it's any different than my divorce hypothetical. What if they initiated involuntary bankruptcy proceedings for the very same reason? Same result, I assume, in the government's view because you -- you take such a purposivist account of the statute, you know, and let's make sure everybody gets everything. I understand that. But I was kind of surprised to see a brief from the government of the United States go on for so many pages about purpose in very generic terms before actually getting to the terms of the statute, the language. And I -- I -- I -- again, why -- why wouldn't my divorce case or the involuntary bankruptcy meet the same purpose test you've articulated here? Well, if -- if that's the case, if you agree that the purpose here is all about individual victims, doesn't that really pose a serious problem for you? Because it seems that the government's effort here is really to externalize the costs of its own investigations in corporate -- in corporate situations. I understand that. You -- you conceded, I believe, to Justice Kagan that Congress's purpose here had to do with individual victims. And if that's the case, it certainly had nothing to do with the government leveraging private internal investigations in -- in -- in corporate -- -- cases, right? Ah. Well, here's another tricky one, for me, along the lines of what the Chief Justice was just asking. It seems to me you're making the case. How do we determine whether an internal investigation is even necessary for the government's work? I mean, presumably, the government can do its own investigation too. So how is an internal investigation that precedes the government's ever necessary in that -- in any sense? And don't companies also conduct internal investigations for their own reasons? They have to worry about shareholder derivative suits, they have to worry about class action suits, they have to worry about compliance with SEC regulations, among many other things. How is a district judge ever going to be able to determine whether an internal investigation was necessary for the criminal investigation by the government? You're not answering my question, counsel. How is -- how is a district judge, the poor district judge, supposed to make a determination which one's necessary for the government's investigation and which one's not? I don't doubt they help the government. I don't doubt the government's happy to receive that information and use the resources, the private resources, to conduct its public business. But how is a district judge supposed to decide what was necessary? ",well what about hire a lawyer to be a witness in a governmental investigation would that be cover in your view counsel you say that the bankruptcy be a proceeding relate to the offense because fraud be at issue there too and and maybe this be a clearer cut case but there be go to be plenty where the reason for the bankruptcy be go to be in dispute and we be go to invite district judge to engage in long collateral proceeding over whether something be or be not relate enough to the offense what do we do about that and relatedly you know this statute cover a lot of different kind of crime include violent crime so i i can imagine someone say my divorce proceeding be relate to the crime of violence and i should get my attorney fee for my divorce proceed too and and child care and all the other thing justice breyer enumerate where where be the stop point here well i mean this be a civil bankruptcy proceeding that be not very narrow and i do not see how it be any different than my divorce hypothetical what if they initiate involuntary bankruptcy proceeding for the very same reason same result i assume in the government s view because you you take such a purposivist account of the statute you know and let us make sure everybody get everything i understand that but i be kind of surprised to see a brief from the government of the united state go on for so many page about purpose in very generic term before actually get to the term of the statute the language and i i i again why why would not my divorce case or the involuntary bankruptcy meet the same purpose test you have articulate here well if if that be the case if you agree that the purpose here be all about individual victim do not that really pose a serious problem for you because it seem that the government s effort here be really to externalize the cost of its own investigation in corporate in corporate situation i understand that you you concede i believe to justice kagan that congress s purpose here have to do with individual victim and if that be the case it certainly have nothing to do with the government leverage private internal investigation in in in corporate case right ah well here s another tricky one for me along the line of what the chief justice be just ask it seem to me you be make the case how do we determine whether an internal investigation be even necessary for the government s work i mean presumably the government can do its own investigation too so how be an internal investigation that precede the government s ever necessary in that in any sense and do not company also conduct internal investigation for their own reason they have to worry about shareholder derivative suit they have to worry about class action suit they have to worry about compliance with sec regulation among many other thing how be a district judge ever go to be able to determine whether an internal investigation be necessary for the criminal investigation by the government you be not answer my question counsel how be how be a district judge the poor district judge suppose to make a determination which one s necessary for the government s investigation and which one s not i do not doubt they help the government i do not doubt the government s happy to receive that information and use the resource the private resource to conduct its public business but how be a district judge suppose to decide what be necessary ,211.52,Roberts Court,"Apr 18, 2018",Sergio Fernando Lagos,United States,16-1519,"Jan 12, 2018","May 29, 2018",115.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

2017,"Digital Realty Trust, Inc. v. Somers",115,Neil Gorsuch,"Well, I -- I'm just stuck on the plain language here, and maybe you can get me unstuck, but -- -- how much clearer could Congress have been than to say in this section the following definitions shall apply, and whistleblower is defined as including a report to the Commission. What else would you have had Congress do if it had wanted to achieve that which your opponent says it achieved? I'm asking what -- what would you have had Congress do? Clearer than in this section, the following definitions shall apply? How much clearer could they have possibly been? So ""shall"" just means maybe; sometimes? So -- so -- I'd like to talk about that notice and comment period for just a moment. It seems to me you've got this plain language problem, so you've got to generate an ambiguity. That's the first step of your -- your move. Then the second step is that the SEC has reasonably resolved that ambiguity and that we should defer to it. But here the notice and comment period provided notice that -- that we're going to issue a rule-making with respect to whistleblowers who report to the Commission. Then -- then the rule comes out and says reporting to the Commission is not required, in an ipsi dixit unreasoned opinion, one line basically, and then we have two circuits that actually gave deference to that interpretation. Now, that seems to me to put the whole administrative process on its head because you're providing no notice to people, no reasonable opportunity to comment, maybe a few people spot the issue, but most people don't. The agency acts without the benefit of the notice and comment and is unable to issue a reasoned decision-making, and then we're supposed to defer to that to resolve this ambiguity? Help me out with that scheme. That just doesn't quite hold together for me. It said to the Commission, for reports to the Commission, that language is in there, too, right? Yeah. Well, if it's not -- if it's not -- if it's not fairly put to the notice, is it any surprise that many people don't comment on it? I'm looking at the notice, though. I'm sorry, I'm just still stuck there. Paragraph 42 I assume is what you're referring to, right? Yeah, it's -- should -- should the anti-retaliation protections, yada, yada, yada, apply broadly to any person who provides information to the Commission concerning a potential violation, right? To the Commission, yeah, but to the Commission, right? But the logical outgrowth test, is -- is it anticipated that something is going to follow? Is it reasonable notice? And, again, what's reasonable about saying X and then doing not X or the opposite of X, and then doing it in an ipsi dixit, one-line sentence, that's unreasoned and wouldn't normally get much deference from us in the first place. How does all that get you Chevron? And you'd -- and you'd agree you don't have an absurdity here. I mean, the government concedes that subsection (iii) would cover a subset of cases -- maybe not as much as -- as the government would like, but -- but it's not an absurd reading, right? Well, counsel, you might have an argument there if there weren't Sarbanes-Oxley as the backdrop, but there is. And so the Chief Justice's point and Justice Breyer's point is that if it were to make a hash of the entire statute, and there'd be meaning -- no meaning at all, maybe, maybe, but you don't -- you don't -- you don't even allege that here. But -- but we don't follow what they're trying to do. We follow what they do do, right? You'd agree with me on that? All right. Do you want to comment on the notice and -- and rule-making procedures here and its reference to how much deference we owe? And I -- I, again, I'm just stuck with the absence of any fair notice, an ipse dixit decision, without any reasons that wouldn't normally pass muster under the APA; and then we have two circuit courts that nonetheless thought that it was appropriate to defer to that, which seems to me allowing an agency to swallow a large amount of legislative power and judicial power in the process, giving up our opportunity to -- to -- to interpret the law as it is. Did both -- Did both. And the other -- and the other court relied exclusively on Chevron. So here we are. It's not making an invalidity argument. It's -- it's asking for deference, as -- as your friend pointed out, which is a different animal. Good. Please. ""Who provides information to the Commission."" Right? That's kind of an important little phrase there. Right. I think it was written very clearly. Would -- would you agree, though, that a notice-and-comment rule-making that didn't provide fair notice shouldn't be deferred to? Well, just hypothetically, let's say whatever your logical outgrowth test is fails to meet that, okay? No notice, no adequate procedures. Should -- should courts defer to that as -- as the law? Let's get to the merits. You would not -- you would not be able to defer to that? All right. ",well i I be just stick on the plain language here and maybe you can get me unstuck but how much clearer could congress have be than to say in this section the following definition shall apply and whistleblower be define as include a report to the commission what else would you have have congress do if it have want to achieve that which your opponent say it achieve I be ask what what would you have have congress do clear than in this section the following definition shall apply how much clearer could they have possibly be so shall just mean maybe sometimes so so I would like to talk about that notice and comment period for just a moment it seem to me you have get this plain language problem so you have get to generate an ambiguity that be the first step of your your move then the second step be that the sec have reasonably resolve that ambiguity and that we should defer to it but here the notice and comment period provide notice that that we be go to issue a rule make with respect to whistleblower who report to the commission then then the rule come out and say reporting to the commission be not require in an ipsi dixit unreasoned opinion one line basically and then we have two circuit that actually give deference to that interpretation now that seem to me to put the whole administrative process on its head because you be provide no notice to people no reasonable opportunity to comment maybe a few people spot the issue but most people do not the agency act without the benefit of the notice and comment and be unable to issue a reasoned decision making and then we be suppose to defer to that to resolve this ambiguity help me out with that scheme that just do not quite hold together for me it say to the commission for report to the commission that language be in there too right yeah well if it be not if it be not if it be not fairly put to the notice be it any surprise that many people do not comment on it I be look at the notice though I be sorry I be just still stick there paragraph i assume be what you be refer to right yeah it be should should the anti retaliation protection yada yada yada apply broadly to any person who provide information to the commission concern a potential violation right to the commission yeah but to the commission right but the logical outgrowth test be be it anticipate that something be go to follow be it reasonable notice and again what be reasonable about say x and then do not x or the opposite of x and then do it in an ipsi dixit one line sentence that be unreasoned and would not normally get much deference from us in the first place how do all that get you chevron and you would and you would agree you do not have an absurdity here i mean the government concede that subsection iii would cover a subset of case maybe not as much as as the government would like but but it be not an absurd reading right well counsel you might have an argument there if there be not sarbanes oxley as the backdrop but there be and so the chief justice s point and justice breyer s point be that if it we be to make a hash of the entire statute and there would be mean no meaning at all maybe maybe but you do not you do not you do not even allege that here but but we do not follow what they be try to do we follow what they do do right you would agree with me on that all right do you want to comment on the notice and and rule making procedure here and its reference to how much deference we owe and i i again I be just stick with the absence of any fair notice an ipse dixit decision without any reason that would not normally pass muster under the apa and then we have two circuit court that nonetheless think that it be appropriate to defer to that which seem to me allow an agency to swallow a large amount of legislative power and judicial power in the process give up our opportunity to to to interpret the law as it be do both do both and the other and the other court rely exclusively on chevron so here we be it be not make an invalidity argument it be it be ask for deference as as your friend point out which be a different animal good please who provide information to the commission right that be kind of an important little phrase there right i think it be write very clearly would would you agree though that a notice and comment rule make that do not provide fair notice should not be defer to well just hypothetically let us say whatever your logical outgrowth test be fail to meet that okay no notice no adequate procedure should should court defer to that as as the law let us get to the merit you would not you would not be able to defer to that all right ,272.64,Roberts Court,"Nov 28, 2017","Digital Realty Trust, Inc.",Paul Somers,16-1276,"Jun 26, 2017","Feb 21, 2018",115.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

2017,National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra,115,Neil Gorsuch,"Well, along those lines, one other question occurs to me that is similar to Justice Breyer's with respect to the adequacy of the record we have for unlicensed clinics. We don't have a lot of evidence with respect to the nature of the burden that would be imposed by the 48-font requirement on all ads. There's some evidence in the amicus briefs that it might be like a $9,000 a month tax for advertisements. But what do we do about the lack of a record here and whether we should wait for an as-applied challenge -- -- as the government suggests? Well, if it's the first kind of statute, then why shouldn't this Court take cognizance of the state's other available means to provide messages? If -- if it's about just ensuring that everyone has full information about their options, why should the state free-ride on a limited number of clinics to provide that information? Well, but if you're trying to educate a class of -- of persons about their rights, it's -- it's pretty unusual to force a private speaker to do that for you under the First Amendment. Well, put -- put aside -- I'm sorry. But counsel, it would have the virtue of applying evenly to all persons and all industries in a law that is very familiar. I mean, anti-fraud provisions in commercial speech are well-known and -- and don't pose any of the problems we've been discussing today. So why wouldn't that be a superior mechanism for addressing these concerns, if -- if we're talking about a narrower set of concerns, just any fraud concerns? The one -- the one is prophylactic and requires you to compel speech from someone else, that -- that implicates First Amendment concerns. The second is -- puts the burden on the government to prove that someone has abused their free-speech rights. And -- and this Court is normally pretty jealously protective of speech.

2017,Hamer v. Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago,115,Neil Gorsuch,"And, Mr. Stewart, if it isn't jurisdictional, one of the questions raised is whether you would have needed to file a cross-appeal. And there's another Circuit split on that question in two very fine opinions, one by Judge Hartz and another by Judge Sutton disagreeing over that. Can you tell me why you don't think you needed to file an appeal yourself if you wished to challenge a district court order -- -- given that's the normal course? Well, isn't that exactly what you wanted to do, is lessen the rights of the appellant by kicking the appellant out of court? She would argue, I think, just to put her argument in the best light and let you respond to it is I -- I obtained this additional right from the district court of an extension of time, which allowed me to pursue this appeal in -- in the Court of Appeals.

2017,Wisconsin Central Ltd. v. United States,115,Neil Gorsuch,"Mr. Dupree, if we're going to look back, as you're encouraging us to do, further than 2004, why not look at 1938 and the regulations that were promulgated then that suggest that money remuneration is broader than you're arguing? Well, what if we read it more broadly? Would you have any further response? I'm sure you don't, but let's just suppose we did. Then what? Why would you wait until the day of exercise, though, if it -- why not the date of vesting, and -- and what -- I'm still not clear on what you do with privately-held stock that is not readily -- there's no liquid market value that you can look to at any point in time. Almost anything can be valued, though. I mean, anything can be reduced to money. So why -- why -- why wait, other than it's convenient for the government? No, no, once it vests, it's different. There's no question that you will be able to exercise it. It's just when. You may choose to exercise it years later, but it vests, so you immediately at that point in time have the right to exercise it on that day. I'm still not clear what your answer to the Chief Justice would be. Sure. So more regulations. Okay. Fine. And what do we do about the more general problem, though, that lots of companies issue lots of things to their employees that are forms of compensation that can be reduced readily to money? You mentioned lifetime passes for riding the rails, for example. Sports tickets might be another. Home technology might be another. Why aren't all those kinds of benefits -- child care -- why don't all those qualify as money remuneration in the government's view, or do they? A home computer? I guess I'm not sure how the regulations help you. I mean, the more recent regulation says, effectively, that money is whatever money is under the statutes. That -- that doesn't do much work, it seems to me. And the fact that -- that the IRS chose to replace the 1938 regulation, that might or might not be more helpful to the government, we can debate that, seems to me a lost opportunity for the government. No? How is the existing regulation helpful to the government? ",mr dupree if we be go to look back as you be encourage us to do far than why not look at and the regulation that we be promulgate then that suggest that money remuneration be broad than you be argue well what if we read it more broadly would you have any further response I be sure you do not but let us just suppose we do then what why would you wait until the day of exercise though if it why not the date of vesting and and what I be still not clear on what you do with privately hold stock that be not readily there be no liquid market value that you can look to at any point in time almost anything can be value though i mean anything can be reduce to money so why why why wait other than it be convenient for the government no no once it vest it be different there be no question that you will be able to exercise it it be just when you may choose to exercise it year later but it vest so you immediately at that point in time have the right to exercise it on that day I be still not clear what your answer to the chief justice would be sure so more regulation okay fine and what do we do about the more general problem though that lot of company issue lot of thing to their employee that be form of compensation that can be reduce readily to money you mention lifetime pass for rid the rail for example sport ticket might be another home technology might be another why be not all those kind of benefit child care why do not all those qualify as money remuneration in the government s view or do they a home computer i guess I be not sure how the regulation help you i mean the more recent regulation say effectively that money be whatever money be under the statute that that do not do much work it seem to me and the fact that that the irs choose to replace the regulation that might or might not be more helpful to the government we can debate that seem to me a lost opportunity for the government no how be the exist regulation helpful to the government ,122.54,Roberts Court,"Apr 16, 2018","Wisconsin Central Ltd., et al.",United States of America,17-530,"Jan 12, 2018","Jun 21, 2018",115.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2017,Pereira v. Sessions,115,Neil Gorsuch,"I -- No, go ahead. I think -- I think the concern that, if I'm correct, that -- that my colleagues are expressing is are -- would -- we may be creating a perverse incentive here for the government to issue earlier notices to appear on dates that it actually has no intention of proceeding in order to stop the clock on clients like yours, rather than being more forthright and saying we don't know when we're going to be able to do it, but here's a notice to stop the clock. We're going to wind up in the same place perhaps, and it's just a paper exercise. That's the concern, I think. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. We wouldn't go that far, counsel. (Laughter.) It -- it just is a matter of administrative convenience that we're going to list it for the first Tuesday on the second month, and maybe we'll get there and maybe we won't. And then we'll just send out a new notice, and a new notice, and a new notice, and a new notice, until we get to the date. So what's the difference between that regime and the regime we currently have? And why -- why is one better for your client than the other? Sometimes when courts require additional procedures to aid a criminal defendant or an immigrant, they wind up perversely creating the opposite, unintended effect. Why isn't your case one of those? Were there any remedy for your -- for -- for your client in a circumstance like the one I've described that you can think of? How is it that under Ordaz a notice to appear isn't a notice to appear if it -- if it's not filed, as Justice Sotomayor pointed out? An extra-statutory requirement that I -- I can't -- I don't see this -- in the language of this statute. Maybe you can tell me where I can find it. But -- but yet a document that contains some of the elements that are required by this statute should qualify? That seems to me to have it sort of backwards. Help me out. I understand that. But -- but the BIA, in its wisdom, has said that a notice to appear isn't a notice to appear if it lacks something that the statute doesn't require, but it is a notice to appear if it lacks something the statute does require. And I am thoroughly confused by that. Maybe you can help me out. So -- so what is the definition of a notice to appear? It doesn't have to have a date. It doesn't have to have a time. Does it have to have the charges? Does it have to have the facts? I mean, when does the emperor have no clothes? At what point? A blank page with -- with the title notice to appear, would that suffice? Well, okay. But if that's true, then surely we don't need to worry about the charges or the law or the facts either. It just could say we're going to -- we're going to come after you at some point, some indefinite point about something having to do with immigration. That would be a notice to appear under your definition, wouldn't it? Well, I'm just wondering where the government would have us draw the line -- -- and why. Okay. So that's the nature of the proceeding. So we've got (A). We've got to have that. How about the legal authority -- -- got to have that? Okay. And how about (C) and (D)? So it's only the date and time that's -- we don't have to have. Everything else is good. (E) through (G), no, none of those? So you don't -- don't need to tell them they need counsel, for example. That's -- that's not required? Okay. Doesn't Congress get to decide what's the essential function of a charging document? I would have thought that, you know, I don't see a distinction between (A) and (D) versus (E) through (G) in -- in this -- in this statute. I mean, Congress could have done that. These are the really important ones -- -- (A) through (D) -- -- (E) through (G), forget about those.

2017,Gill v. Whitford,115,Neil Gorsuch,"Ms. Murphy -- I'd like to go back to Justice Breyer's question. It would be helpful to get an answer for me on that. What criteria would a state need to know in order to avoid having every district and every case and every election subject to litigation? Because the -- the standards given in -- in the lower court here was, well, a little bit of partisan symmetry problem, a little bit of an efficiency gap problem, not a real set of criteria. And here, you know, is it 7 percent, how durable, how many elections would we need? How much data would we have to gather? Walk us through Justice Breyer's question and provide some answers, if you -- if you would. Okay. But what are the questions -- you know, I need two years or two cycles worth of data. I need an S curve of a certain shape and size. I need an efficiency gap of something. What are the numbers, what are the criteria we'd have to fill in as a constitutional matter in order for a state to be able to administer this? But if you could try to answer -- So, Mr. Smith, what is the formula that achieves that? Because the court below didn't rely on efficiency gap entirely. It looked also at the partisan symmetry test. It reminds me a little bit of my steak rub. I like some turmeric, I like a few other little ingredients, but I'm not going to tell you how much of each. And so what's this Court supposed to do? A pinch of this, a pinch of that? Or are we supposed to actually specify it's going to be the Chief Justice's formula of the efficiency gap of 7 percent for the country? Is that what you're asking us to do? What is it that you want us to constitutionalize? Well, but there are different tests for measuring symmetry -- -- right? There is the test you previously proposed. Now there is the efficiency gap test. And the Court relied on both and said a little bit -- a pinch this and a pinch of that -- -- and we're not telling you how much of each. So -- -- so that doesn't seem very fair to the states to me, to -- to -- to know how to -- what they're supposed to do to avoid the kind of litigation we're talking about. As I understand the efficiency gap test itself, and tell me if I'm wrong, that it would yield about a third of all the districts in the country winding up in court. Now, that's what the other side says. So tell me where that's wrong and tell me what test you'd have this Court adopt. How? I am still stuck on Justice Breyer's question. Any of them? Any -- any of the three? All of them? Mr. Smith, is that a -- is that a republican form of government claim? Isn't that -- isn't that exactly what you're trying to do, though? You're saying it's a one-party rule and that would violate a republican form of government guarantee. Wouldn't that be the more specific constitutional provision to look to, rather than the generic equal protection clause? For that matter, maybe we can just for a second talk about the arcane matter, the Constitution. And where exactly do we get authority to revise state legislative lines? When -- when the Constitution authorizes the federal government to step in on state -- state legislative matters, it's pretty clear. If you look at the Fifteenth Amendment, you look at the Nineteenth Amendment, the Twenty-Sixth Amendment, and even the Fourteenth Amendment, Section 2, says Congress has the power, when state legislators don't provide the right to vote equally, to dilute congressional representation. Aren't those all textual indications in the Constitution itself that maybe we ought to be cautious about stepping in here? Do you see any impediment to Congress acting in this this area?

2017,Ohio v. American Express Co.,115,Neil Gorsuch,"We're not here to protect competitors, right, Mr. Murphy? Or -- or necessarily even merchants. The antitrust laws are aimed at protecting consumers; you'd agree with that? Okay. So, given that, there's no evidence of restricted output in this case, correct? And that's normally what the antitrust laws care about, is deadweight loss. That's the primary concern of antitrust activity, wouldn't you agree? Okay. All right. So you're left with this price question. And you have an increase in price to merchants, but do we have any evidence that consumers, at the end of the day, including the rewards aspect of what they get back, actually pay a net price increase? What evidence do you have of that? No, no. No, no. Evidence of price -- net price increase to consumers. I know you don't. I'm just asking -- -- if you have any evidence of it. Well, you have proof that not all of the increased price that American Express extracts gets to the consumer. That's not my question, however. My question is, do you have any evidence that, on a net basis, consumers pay more? And I don't believe you have. I'm asking about consumers. But I -- Isn't that true with every vertical restraint? Anytime I say I'm only going to service Cadillacs at a Cadillac dealership, I can't buy a Volvo at a Cadillac dealership. All vertical restraints have the impact of restricting interbrand competition in that respect, but we learned through painful experience and many, many years that they're generally pro-competitive, right? Right. So you'd just have us ignore the fact that Visa and MasterCard have 74 percent of the market? Or that they exercise no restraint in this marketplace? That -- that's gone, though, right? I mean, any notion of horizontal agreement in this case is out of the case. Mr. Stewart, what would you say, though, I mean, you -- you argue to us that this is a very unique situation and new -- new to antitrust law, the two-sided market issue, and assuming all that's true -- I'm not sure it is, but taking it as true -- why shouldn't we take Judge Easterbrook's admonition seriously, that judicial errors are a lot harder to correct than an occasional monopoly where you can hope and assume that the market will eventually correct it. Judicial errors are very difficult to correct. And we've had a long and painful experience with vertical restraints in this Court going back to Dr. Miles that it took decades to correct, in Leegin; Albrecht, which took decades to correct in State Oil. Why should we disregard those admonitions in this case? I assume you'd like us to. For just these reasons. And they're free to do that, right? I mean, American Express's agreements don't affect MasterCard or Visa's opportunity to cut their fees, their own fees, or to advertise that American Express's are higher. There is room for all of that kind of competition here. It's just the difference between Cadillacs and Kias. People can choose. Do they want a high cost, high reward, a low-cost, cheaper alternative? And the two sides can compete with one another. Absent a horizontal agreement, we have that, don't we? Well, that was part of the case originally, but that's gone now, right? Because those agreements have been dropped by -- by Visa and MasterCard. I completely understand and accept that if that were part of the case, we'd have a very different case. Right. I understand the merchants can't, but the competitors can advertise all of these issues and they can point out their lower merchant fees to consumers, as they do. So, Mr. Stewart, I'm sorry, I apologize. I just want to make sure I understand the argument then. Is it that the consumer welfare here is measured by the relative effectiveness of advertising by merchants as compared to by Visa and MasterCard? Mr. Chesler -- -- with respect to that, and in response to Justice Breyer, we talked about the fact that the agreement does limit the merchant's ability to do certain things and -- and whether that might meet step 1, but I would have thought under -- under Section 1, you might have responded, yes, if there's market power. But market power, absent market power -- an agreement with a merchant to do anything that restricts anything is not in the cognizance of the antitrust laws. And a 26 percent player, absent some proof, other proof, is not -- does not have market power. I -- I just want to pause right there. You -- you accept that to show an anticompetitive effect, you have to show not just an agreement -- -- but also that it -- market power in some way, shape, or form? Right, but you agree it need be shown? Right -- -- if there were no market power, an agreement would have no anticompetitive effect? ",we be not here to protect competitor right mr murphy or or necessarily even merchant the antitrust law be aim at protect consumer you would agree with that okay so give that there be no evidence of restrict output in this case correct and that be normally what the antitrust law care about be deadweight loss that be the primary concern of antitrust activity would not you agree okay all right so you be leave with this price question and you have an increase in price to merchant but do we have any evidence that consumer at the end of the day include the reward aspect of what they get back actually pay a net price increase what evidence do you have of that no no no no evidence of price net price increase to consumer i know you do not I be just ask if you have any evidence of it well you have proof that not all of the increased price that american express extract get to the consumer that be not my question however my question be do you have any evidence that on a net basis consumer pay more and i do not believe you have I be ask about consumer but i be not that true with every vertical restraint anytime i say I be only go to service cadillacs at a cadillac dealership i can not buy a volvo at a cadillac dealership all vertical restraint have the impact of restrict interbrand competition in that respect but we learn through painful experience and many many year that they be generally pro competitive right right so you have just have us ignore the fact that visa and mastercard have percent of the market or that they exercise no restraint in this marketplace that that be go though right i mean any notion of horizontal agreement in this case be out of the case mr stewart what would you say though i mean you you argue to us that this be a very unique situation and new new to antitrust law the two side market issue and assume all that be true I be not sure it be but take it as true why should not we take judge easterbrook s admonition seriously that judicial error be a lot hard to correct than an occasional monopoly where you can hope and assume that the market will eventually correct it judicial error be very difficult to correct and we have have a long and painful experience with vertical restraint in this court go back to dr mile that it take decade to correct in leegin albrecht which take decade to correct in state oil why should we disregard those admonition in this case i assume you would like us to for just these reason and they be free to do that right i mean american express s agreement do not affect mastercard or visa s opportunity to cut their fee their own fee or to advertise that american express s be high there be room for all of that kind of competition here it be just the difference between cadillacs and kias people can choose do they want a high cost high reward a low cost cheap alternative and the two side can compete with one another absent a horizontal agreement we have that do not we well that be part of the case originally but that be go now right because those agreement have be drop by by visa and mastercard i completely understand and accept that if that we be part of the case we would have a very different case right i understand the merchant can not but the competitor can advertise all of these issue and they can point out their low merchant fee to consumer as they do so mr stewart I be sorry i apologize i just want to make sure i understand the argument then be it that the consumer welfare here be measure by the relative effectiveness of advertising by merchant as compare to by visa and mastercard mr chesler with respect to that and in response to justice breyer we talk about the fact that the agreement do limit the merchant s ability to do certain thing and and whether that might meet step but i would have think under under section you might have respond yes if there be market power but market power absent market power an agreement with a merchant to do anything that restrict anything be not in the cognizance of the antitrust law and a percent player absent some proof other proof be not do not have market power i i just want to pause right there you you accept that to show an anticompetitive effect you have to show not just an agreement but also that it market power in some way shape or form right but you agree it need be show right if there we be no market power an agreement would have no anticompetitive effect ,271.4800000000001,Roberts Court,"Feb 26, 2018","State of Ohio, et al.","American Express Company, et al.",16-1454,"Oct 16, 2017","Jun 25, 2018",115.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1

Well, and -- -- and then we should just go ahead and do the same thing for drugs and papers too, because -- and Entek, we can overrule Entek while we're at it, going all the way back to the founding because, you know, we can see somebody, they have a fireplace, they have a chimney, they could destroy the papers that we see through the window or the drugs. We know that they have indoor plumbing. And so they can be readily destroyed too. What's the difference between the destruction of drugs and papers in a home and a car in -- in the garage? Well, counsel, when I -- when I look at the automobile exception's history and go back to Carroll, it was actually an originalist opinion that looked at cars and -- and analogized them to ships and vessels, going all the way back to 1790. And so that's different than homes or curtilage. And -- and -- and cars are like vessels on the open sea or in port. It never suggested that you can go look for one in a home. That was never the basis. It was: You can search something that is on the open seas or in a -- in a harbor or on the streets, not that you can go into a home to find one. That seems to me categorically -- a category mistake that you're making in your argument. Can you help me with that? Well, I just cited the Supreme Court's jurisprudence in Carroll. So I'm not sure it's fair to point it, the arrow, in this direction, counsel. ",so under that rule though police could as i understand your position search for car in garage close garage carport anywhere on a property no matter how closely attach or even if firmly attach to the house not in the house but on the curtilage okay but if we say that be curtilage which a lot of case in the past at least have suggest and we deem a barn a garage curtilage then the police can without a warrant search for a car there under your rule right not many people live in their garage some people do some people do and in barn but usually they be reserve for car and for animal and you be suggest that in those place the police can search without a warrant correct well and and then we should just go ahead and do the same thing for drug and paper too because and entek we can overrule entek while we be at it go all the way back to the founding because you know we can see somebody they have a fireplace they have a chimney they could destroy the paper that we see through the window or the drug we know that they have indoor plumbing and so they can be readily destroy too what be the difference between the destruction of drug and paper in a home and a car in in the garage well counsel when i when i look at the automobile exception s history and go back to carroll it be actually an originalist opinion that look at car and and analogize them to ship and vessel go all the way back to and so that be different than home or curtilage and and and car be like vessel on the open sea or in port it never suggest that you can go look for one in a home that be never the basis it be you can search something that be on the open sea or in a in a harbor or on the street not that you can go into a home to find one that seem to me categorically a category mistake that you be make in your argument can you help me with that well i just cite the supreme court s jurisprudence in carroll so I be not sure it be fair to point it the arrow in this direction counsel ,126.48000000000002,Roberts Court,"Jan 9, 2018",Ray Austin Collins,Commonwealth of Virginia,16-1027,"Sep 28, 2017","May 29, 2018",115.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2017,"Oil States Energy Services LLC v. Greene’s Energy Group, LLC",115,Neil Gorsuch,"Ms. -- Ms. Ho, we have a number of cases that have arguably addressed this issue already, like McCormick, for example, in which this Court said the only authority competent to set a patent aside or to annul it or to correct it for any reason whatever is vested in the courts of the United States. We have cases -- and American Bell is another one. We have that wonderful quote from Justice Story indicating that any correction to a patent has to go to a court. The United States takes the position, as I understand it, that some of those decisions are purely statutory interpretation. What's your reading of those cases? Why is your reading that they're constitutional, if you could help me with that? Why not -- why not, though, Ms. Ho, just simply say the question is whether there's a private right involved? In answering Justice Kagan's questions and Justice Breyer's questions, you struggled with how much of an adjudication does an inquisitorial process have to have before it becomes an adjudication. Why does that matter at all? If -- if you really want to stake your ground and think McCormick's right, why not just say anytime a private right is taken by anyone, it has to be through an Article III forum? Schor is about the line between public and private rights. You can stake your ground and simply say this is a private right. But then you -- but then you -- Well, now, counsel, there's only judicial review if somebody appeals. This isn't like an adjunct to the district court, like a magistrate judge or -- or a bankruptcy judge, and I didn't -- I didn't see any argument in your brief under Crowell or something like that that this is really an Article III adjunct. I -- I -- I saw an argument that this stands alone, fine, in the executive branch and that there's, in fact, a self-executing judgment issued by the director that, if not appealed, has all the force of law of an Article III court. Did I miss something? If somebody takes review, but if not, it -- it's binding, right? Well, it's not true with respect to magistrate judges or anything like that. You have an absolute, you know, opportunity -- the district judge has to put its imprimatur on it before it has -- as an adjunct of the district court. It is a different structure, yes. Do you think it would work if -- if we had land patents subject to the same circumstances, that they could be reexamined at any time over hundreds of years, even after the farmer had sold the land to the developer who built the houses and that the land patent could be revoked by the government, by bureaucracy, I suppose, in the Department of Interior? But, that it is subject to packing by a director who's unhappy with the results? A monopoly in the use of land. What's -- what's the difference between -- operative difference, other than obviously one isn't land? Isn't that question begging about what's a private right? Isn't that the very question this Court has to decide? Fair -- fair enough, when it's -- when it's granted, but once it's granted, there's an abundance of law going back 400 years. Justice Story says it. I mean, you know, this is not new idea, that once it's granted, it's a private right belonging to the inventor. Justice Story said it is a property that has -- an inventions of a property which is often of very great value, in which the law intended to give him, the inventor, absolute enjoyment. Yeah. Mr. -- Mr. Stewart, could you address the Chief Justice's question, which I'm also stuck on, the bitter and the sweet, to the -- to what extent could the executive condition patents on, say, you have no takings rights later or you -- you take it subject to whatever conditions in terms of its withdrawal that we wish to impose. Including -- including maybe -- and, arguably, I understand -- the condition that we will stack the deck with judges whom we like -- administrative judges we like? So the answer to Justice Breyer's question then, if there are all these reliance interests and $40 million or billion dollars spent, that would just be you're out of luck -- -- take the bitter with the sweet? Can you answer that -- answer that question? So is the answer yes? So -- so -- -- I take it the answer is yes? Mr. Stewart, let's say we had a land patent. Let's say the land patent said it becomes invalid if anybody in -- uses the land in an improper way, in violation of an environmental law, labor law, you choose. Let's say the land then gets developed and turns into a housing development outside of, I don't know, Philadelphia. And it turns out, though, that a great-grandfather who owned the land originally back when it was a farm, indeed violated a labor or environmental law, rendering the land patent invalid on its terms. Could -- couldn't the Bureau of Land Management, for example, or some other department, Interior, official just pull back the patent? Under your theory? Well, you dispute that they're constitutional holdings in your brief. So, presumably, there's nothing to prohibit the scheme I've just described in the government's position, correct? It's a yes-or-no answer I'm looking for. Exactly. Exactly. Those were four -- four cases, I believe, right? And involve foreign -- foreign patent applicants, right? No, not the reissuance. The invalidity. Yeah. But the invalidity, it's just those four cases you have, right? The foreign -- that period of time when there was a brief statute permitting executive rejection of patents by foreigners? All right. Fair enough. But, Mr. Stewart, if I understand your answer, an infringement action could be adjudicated by the director so long as money damages were not sought, and that would be fine. So a declaration of non-infringement could be issued by the director, for example, right? So traditional being more than 40 years but less than 400? Or what -- -- what's the -- what's the cutoff? ",ms ms ho we have a number of case that have arguably address this issue already like mccormick for example in which this court say the only authority competent to set a patent aside or to annul it or to correct it for any reason whatever be vest in the court of the united state we have case and american bell be another one we have that wonderful quote from justice story indicate that any

2017,China Agritech v. Resh,115,Neil Gorsuch,"Counsel -- -- I just -- no, please go ahead. Counsel, just returning to where the Chief Justice started us, under American Pipe, we say that equitable tolling gets you a new claim here. And you accept that. But you ask us to write an exception to Rule 23. So you get a new claim, except for Rule 23. You don't get the benefit of that rule. Is there another circumstance where courts have allowed equitable tolling but denied access to procedural mechanisms in a subsequent suit? No, I'm talking about after equitable tolling, that this Court has imposed and allowed -- -- a new suit, can you think of another example where in that new suit the equitably tolled plaintiff is forbidden from accessing a particular procedural right -- -- otherwise available to all litigants? Exactly. All right. And that's pretty -- I'm sorry, and that's pretty unusual, right? I can't think of another example in equitable tolling doctrine where we do this, which may suggest some question about whether American Pipe is correct. And if we have doubts about that, why should we extend it so radically here in a way that was unforeseen even by the authors of American Pipe? I'm sorry -- I'm sorry to interrupt, but -- but if -- if we doubt those rationales, if we doubt American Pipe and think that it doesn't really represent true equitable tolling principles at common law, why would we extend that? But only on the understanding of American Pipe that it's after the fact rather than before the fact. That's the difference, I guess. I guess I'm not -- I don't think anybody questions the importance of that -- that function of the rule. I think the question that Justice Breyer is getting at, and I guess I am too in a way, is can you stack them forever, so that try, try again, and that the statute of limitations never really has any force in these cases. What do we do about that, given the congressional judgment that there should be a statute of limitations? And what restraints might there be if -- if not the ones that your friend proposes that the Ninth Circuit suggested, for example, that class action attorneys would exercise restraint. Should we rely on that? Well, if we -- if we were to rule against you, it seems to me the effect might be that we would encourage more protective filings, and that would solve the problem, wouldn't it? We wouldn't have to create these extraordinary rules in extending American Pipe in new ways; we'd just create a new incentive structure that would ensure that there are backup class actions available. What -- what's wrong with that? And -- and we're now balancing a multiplicity of interests in a slightly different context. And why wouldn't the balance with respect to encouraging protective filings might be slightly different here? The alternative is backhand administration over comity questions that are effectively unreviewable. So how do we weigh those two interests? Are you aware of any court that's ever held that a district court abused its discretion in -- in -- in declining to follow another district court's decision? ",counsel i just no please go ahead counsel just return to where the chief justice start us under american pipe we say that equitable toll get you a new claim here and you accept that but you ask us to write an exception to rule so you get a new claim except for rule you do not get the benefit of that rule be there another circumstance where court have allow equitable toll but deny access to procedural mechanism in a subsequent suit no I be talk about after equitable tolling that this court have impose and allow a new suit can you think of another example where in that new suit the equitably tolled plaintiff be forbid from access a particular procedural right otherwise available to all litigant exactly all right and that be pretty I be sorry and that be pretty unusual right i can not think of another example in equitable tolling doctrine where we do this which may suggest some question about whether american pipe be correct and if we have doubt about that why should we extend it so radically here in a way that be unforeseen even by the author of american pipe I be sorry I be sorry to interrupt but but if if we doubt those rationale if we doubt american pipe and think that it do not really represent true equitable tolling principle at common law why would we extend that but only on the understanding of american pipe that it be after the fact rather than before the fact that be the difference i guess i guess I be not i do not think anybody question the importance of that that function of the rule i think the question that justice breyer be get at and i guess i be too in a way be can you stack them forever so that try try again and that the statute of limitation never really have any force in these case what do we do about that give the congressional judgment that there should be a statute of limitation and what restraint might there be if if not the one that your friend propose that the ninth circuit suggest for example that class action attorney would exercise restraint should we rely on that well if we if we we be to rule against you it seem to me the effect might be that we would encourage more protective filing and that would solve the problem would not it we would not have to create these extraordinary rule in extend american pipe in new way we would just create a new incentive structure that would ensure that there be backup class action available what what be wrong with that and and we be now balance a multiplicity of interest in a slightly different context and why would not the balance with respect to encourage protective filing might be slightly different here the alternative be backhand administration over comity question that be effectively unreviewable so how do we weigh those two interest be you aware of any court that be ever hold that a district court abuse its discretion in in in decline to follow another district court s decision ,186.87,Roberts Court,"Mar 26, 2018","China Agritech, Inc.","Michael H.

2017,Marinello v. United States,115,Neil Gorsuch,"Mr. -- Well, Mr. Hellman, what role should lenity play here, if any? Saving that for the next case. So -- so, for example, if we are left with some ambiguity as to your Aguilar analogy, that's when you would suggest perhaps lenity might be a tiebreaker? Well, does it get us part of the way there, though? Because the officer clause, as Justice Sotomayor suggests, you have to actually hinder something the officer is doing. And could that same spirit or thought be thought to apply in the administration as well, that the IRS has to be doing something? Your preceding thought is a -- is a doing, it is a thing; it is not just merely -- I think the IRS speaks of the pervasive, continuous, brooding omnipresence of -- -- of tax liabilities, that there's an implication from the officers clause that there's something more going on. Am I -- maybe that's not entirely helpful. No, no, no. No, no, limiting it to some affirmative act going on by the agency, I think, is what Justice Sotomayor was suggesting, that the agency has to be doing something other than merely passively receiving taxes. Correct. It's -- it's a friendly amendment. (Laughter.) I'm not even arguing with you. I'm just suggesting that the officers clause might be a source of some aid to you. That's all I'm doing. Well, Justice -- Justice Breyer's snow shoveler, all right, I -- I think you -- he's a felon under your interpretation because the -- the person who's paying him knows that, above $600 or whatever it is, I have to file a 1099. I'm not doing it -- I'm doing it for an unlawful advantage for the snow shoveler. I know it. I'm a -- I'm a federal felon. For my -- for my friend's son's snow shoveling business. Right? I mean, the answer is yes, I think, isn't it? (Laughter.) I'm waiting for a yes or a no. You can just -- it may come within the scope. So that's a yes? Okay. All right. How -- how is somebody supposed to know when they're going to be in trouble here? Because it seems like paying cash -- -- can sometimes be a problem. That was part of the indictment and -- and the jury instructions here. Or keeping records, failure to keep records -- -- that you didn't -- that aren't lawfully obliged to be kept. The government made some similar arguments in the honest services case, that everything can be cured by a mens rea requirement. We don't need to worry about actus reus. We'll tell you about the actus reus when we get there. We'll create a common law of honest services. And here it seems to me that's what the government's parallel -- parallel argument, that we're not going to tell you what qualifies. We'll find out later. And sometimes it's going to be simply paying cash. Sometimes it's not going to be keeping records. And -- and I just wonder are we going to wind up in the same place, that you drive this thing to such enormous breadth in its interpretation that you're -- you're inviting a vagueness challenge at the back end? And paying cash is enough, though, under the government -- Well, it is in this case. That's -- that's in the jury instructions. Right. Really? It is a -- it is a remarkable -- On -- on that -- on that score, the verbs ""obstruct"" and ""impede,"" along with ""corruptly,"" the adverb, you normally expect there to be an object to them. I have to -- have to -- because it is specific intent, as Justice Breyer pointed out, and you've conceded. I have to know about some thing and I have to intend to obstruct or impede that thing. And the government's interpretation of that thing, as I understand it, in its words is the continuous, ubiquitous, and universal collection of taxes. Is -- is that an object that's reasonably inferred? Can one -- can one intend -- know of and intend to impede or obstruct, corruptly or otherwise, something that's continuous, ubiquitous, and universal? I think that's out of -- -- your brief in opposition, right? But -- but don't those -- don't those verbs imply that there's something more direct as the object of my actions than -- than something that's continuous, ubiquitous, and universal? Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. But Congress legislates against the backdrop of what's out there. And what -- what was out there was our interpretation of those words requiring a nexus to an active proceeding, something more than -- something more definite than something that's continuous, ubiquitous and universal. And -- and the Congress that passed this statute had that interpretation in its back pocket at the time; right? And you think it's preferable given its heritage and for other reasons?

2017,Class v. United States,115,Neil Gorsuch,"I guess I'm a little confused by that reply. Why would it be that you would implicitly waive statutory but not constitutional claims by your guilty plea? You said we could go either way, but I think the premise underlying your response to Justice Kagan was a guilty plea waives a trial. It doesn't necessarily waive other legal claims that might exist outside of trial. And this might be one, that the statute should be interpreted differently. Okay, okay, but -- (Laughter.) How? How, analytically, would that work? It's more important than statutes. Well, Mr. Feigin -- Mr. Feigin, on that, I -- I look to history to start with. And -- and Justice Harlan in Haynes suggested otherwise, that you could challenge the constitutionality of the statute. And he cited a Second Circuit case, and we traced it back and it goes all the way back to 1869 and Justice Ames in Massachusetts, indicating quite clearly almost exactly what Justice Breyer just -- he might have channeled his inner Justice Ames there. And it's suggesting that not only is it -- you're not admitting even to what the statute says; you're admitting to what's in the indictment. Isn't that maybe the most natural and historically consistent understanding of what a guilty plea is? I plead guilty to that which I am charged. What's in the indictment. Well, what do I do about the Haynes and -- and this 150 years of history? Well, putting aside Rule 11, because I have some of the same difficulties that haven't been addressed yet as Justice Kagan expressed, but just -- just understanding of what a guilty plea means. Justice Harlan didn't mean what he wrote? Well, but -- well, but if I plead guilty, I'm -- I'm admitting the facts and I'm admitting the elements that are charged in the complaint or the indictment.

2017,Wilson v. Sellers,115,Neil Gorsuch,"Mr. Olive, if we're talking about consequences of the ruling here, it seems to me it's possible that by adopting a look-through rule, we would encourage state supreme courts to say more, perhaps very little more, maybe as little as we're -- we're agreeing with the result but not necessarily the reasoning. But equally possible would be to encourage state intermediate courts to say less and perhaps take advantage of Harrington, so that no state court says anything and achieves maximum deference from federal courts, like California has, for example. Should we be concerned that a ruling in favor of look-through might actually yield if states are rational and look for the least cost and the most deference adverse consequences to your -- your -- your clients? I'm asking you, do you agree with that? I mean, do you think that's right? I understand they are, but perhaps state legislatures are. And they may for altruistic reasons, as in Georgia -- very, very altruistic reasons, insist on a practice of some reasoned decision-making, but couldn't you see other state legislators making other decisions, say like California has, because of the cost of analyzing these cases? Counsel -- Counsel, you know, of course, in this Court, we say our summary affirmances are not necessarily an endorsement of the -- of the lower court's reasoning. That's well established in this Court's jurisprudence. And as I understood Mr. Olive, he said it might be a different case if that were clearer in Georgia. So let's say we are going to now confront 50 states or X number of states with rules or something in their precedents or a footnote saying we do not necessarily endorse all the lower court reasoning, just exactly as this Court has done for itself. Then what? Mr. Olive, we've spent -- we're spending a lot of time arguing about Georgia specific law, and I -- I guess I'm wondering if -- if it all turns on what the state court practice is, and we're going to create a huge incentive for a state court to simply adopt different orders that say, we adopt more or less the reasoning of the appellate court but -- but not necessarily all of it, and there may be other reasons, what have we accomplished in -- in this? Presumably, we're going to defer to those final decisions of the state courts and not look behind those. I mean, I haven't heard an argument that we'd look behind that kind of ruling. So what exactly have we accomplished here? So even if a state supreme court says we affirm the judgment, and -- and uses language exactly like this Court uses, but not necessarily all the reasonings, and there may be additional reasons beyond those that the lower court provided, we would look behind that? Is that -- is that the suggestion? And how does that fit with federalism and comity? Even when the court -- supreme court disclaims -- -- that? Okay. And -- and in that case then, what have we accomplished is my question, if you could answer that? It's just going to be a slightly different rubber stamp. I'd say correct and stop if I were you.

You've abandoned that argument on a statutory interpretation ground. And I'm curious, why? But -- but -- but, we normally -- we normally interpret statutes in ways to avoid constitutional difficulties, not in ways to create them. But you -- you'd take a win on statutory grounds, wouldn't you? But, Mr. Clement, how do we know that Congress would have passed (2) without (1)? (1) makes the regulation free because it says, states, you have to do this. And it doesn't cause any budget impact on the federal government. (2), under your interpretation, is a direct regulation by the government, and therefore might cost money. And you could see a legislature saying: Well, you know, (1) makes sense, and I'm only going to vote for (2) because of (1) -- -- because it's free. It comes for free. That's neither here nor there -- -- for purposes of my -- my question. My question is, if we're asking the severability question the Chief Justice posed to you, one of the questions we have is what Congress would have done in -- in a different world? Now, that's a very hard question to answer, but that's the question we were posed. And how do we know Congress would have passed (2) without (1), given that (2) in this world, if it's -- if (1) is fine, (2) comes for free? Or -- or does it serve the interest of making it cheap by allowing Congress not to have to expend any funds to enforce its laws? But where's the line? The Third Circuit said de minimis private gambling isn't covered. On page 30 of your brief, you indicate maybe the state could have a certain dollar threshold, and that wouldn't be authorizing. I -- I'm really not clear why that wouldn't be authorizing if you specify a threshold dollar amount in state law. You know, what -- what if they said you can do it at the Elks Club, is that authorizing? Where -- where does the government draw the line?

2017,"Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission",115,Neil Gorsuch,"Well, actually, counsel, that seems to be a point of contention. The state seems to concede that if it were the message, your -- your client would have a right to refuse. But if it -- the objection is to the person, that's when the discrimination law kicks in. That's Footnote 8 of the Colorado Court of Appeals' decision. I know you know this. So what do you say to that, that actually what is happening here may superficially look like it's about the message, but it's really about the person's identity? So, General, what -- what is the line? How -- how would you have this Court draw the line? You've been asked a lot of specifics -- -- but I'd -- I'd appreciate a more abstract general rule that the government suggests. Like the Jackson Pollock? In fact, I have yet to have a -- a wedding cake that I would say tastes great. (Laughter.) Yeah. Is it a predominant purpose test -- -- or is it -- would you say it's a predominant purpose or a predominant effect? How would you characterize that? Yes. Yes, yes. In its purpose or its effect on others? But you'd agree that would be a problem -- Mr. Yarger, you actually -- -- you actually have a second commissioner who also said that he's -- if someone has an issue with the laws impacting his personal belief system, he has to look at compromising that belief system presumably as well, right? But a second commissioner? -- so we have two -- two -- two commissioners out of seven who've expressed something along these lines. What if we disagree with -- What if we disagree with you? Then what follows? Mr. Yarger -- Mr. Yarger, may I ask -- I -- I have a quick question about the remedy. As I understand it, Colorado ordered Mr. Phillips to provide comprehensive training to his staff, and it didn't order him to attend a class of the government's own creation or anything like that, but to provide comprehensive staff training. Why -- why isn't that compelled speech and possibly in violation of his free-exercise rights? Because presumably he has to tell his staff, including his family members, that his Christian beliefs are discriminatory. Yeah. But this isn't attending your training. Mr. Yarger, again, I agree with you, some sort of training by an outside group, but this order was ordering him to provide training and presumably compelling him to speak, therefore, and to speak in ways that maybe offend his religion and certainly compel him to speak. And given that, plus the discriminatory language in the -- in the Commission's discussion, I just -- that concerns me, and I just wonder what you have to say about it. Well, let's take -- let's take a case a little bit more like ours, and -- and it doesn't involve words, but just a cake. It is Red Cross, and the baker serves someone who wants a red cross to celebrate the anniversary of a great humanitarian organization. Next person comes in and wants the same red cross to celebrate the KKK. Does the baker have to sell to the second customer? And if not, why not? Well, why is that any different than our case? You say it's not based on identity, but the baker might well say I -- I -- I despise people who adhere to the creed -- -- of the KKK. That's one way of characterizing it. Another way of characterizing it is saying I disagree with the message of the KKK. So too here. One could make the exact analogy, I would think, that you could either characterize it as I -- I don't like people of a certain class or I -- or I have a religious belief against this kind of union. So how do I distinguish those cases? I'm not sure it's quite as easy as you suggest. That -- that's -- ",well actually counsel that seem to be a point of contention the state seem to concede that if it we be the message your your client would have a right to refuse but if it the objection be to the person that be when the discrimination law kick in that be footnote of the colorado court of appeal decision i know you know this so what do you say to that that actually what be happen here may superficially look like it be about the message but it be really about the person s identity so general what what be the line how how would you have this court draw the line you have be ask a lot of specific but I would I would appreciate a more abstract general rule that the government suggest like the jackson pollock in fact i have yet to have a a wedding cake that i would say taste great laughter yeah be it a predominant purpose test or be it would you say it be a predominant purpose or a predominant effect how would you characterize that yes yes yes in its purpose or its effect on others but you would agree that would be a problem mr yarger you actually you actually have a second commissioner who also say that he have if someone have an issue with the law impact his personal belief system he have to look at compromise that belief system presumably as well right but a second commissioner so we have two two two commissioner out of seven who have express something along these line what if we disagree with what if we disagree with you then what follow mr yarger mr yarger may i ask i i have a quick question about the remedy as i understand it colorado order mr phillips to provide comprehensive training to his staff and it do not order him to attend a class of the government s own creation or anything like that but to provide comprehensive staff training why why be not that compel speech and possibly in violation of his free exercise right because presumably he have to tell his staff include his family member that his christian belief be discriminatory yeah but this be not attend your training mr yarger again i agree with you some sort of training by an outside group but this order be order him to provide training and presumably compel him to speak therefore and to speak in way that maybe offend his religion and certainly compel him to speak and give that plus the discriminatory language in the in the commission s discussion i just that concern me and i just wonder what you have to say about it well let us take let us take a case a little bit more like ours and and it do not involve word but just a cake it be red cross and the baker serve someone who want a red cross to celebrate the anniversary of a great humanitarian organization next person come in and want the same red cross to celebrate the kkk do the baker have to sell to the second customer and if not why not well why be that any different than our case you say it be not base on identity but the baker might well say i i i despise people who adhere to the creed of the kkk that be one way of characterize it another way of characterize it be say i disagree with the message of the kkk so too here one could make the exact analogy i would think that you could either characterize it as i i do not like people of a certain class or i or i have a religious belief against this kind of union so how do i distinguish those case I be not sure it be quite as easy as you suggest that that be ,194.64,Roberts Court,"Dec 5, 2017","Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd.; and Jack C.

""Any covered class action brought in a state court involving a covered security as set forth in (b)."" The government makes the argument that if, in fact, all you were doing was referring to (b), including state law classes -- state law causes of action, you wouldn't need ""involving a covered security."" That language would be superfluous. No, no, because we're talking about removal here. So you have to identify cases that are in state court in order to do any of that.

2017,Byrd v. United States,115,Neil Gorsuch,"Mr. Loeb -- -- if I can -- if I can follow up on -- on Justice Sotomayor's question and -- and Justice Breyer's in terms of what's the clear line we can draw here. You've raised two theories on which you might prevail. One, a property law theory, essentially, as I understand it, that possession is good title against everybody except for people with superior title. And -- and I understand that. That's an ancient common law rule. I can go back and find that in treatises all the way back to Joseph Story. Or I can do this reasonable expectation of privacy test, and that's what we've been struggling with so far. What's the -- we have to ask what the nature of the contract is and the terms of the contract. We might want to look at the nature of the relationship between Mr. Byrd and -- and Ms. Reed. There was a lot of debate in the briefs over whether they're girlfriend and boyfriend or fiancée or maybe common law marriage and someone's cheating on someone else. All of that's in the briefs that we have to contend with. Then we have the question whether the test is even an empirical or a normative question. Do we look at what the reasonable expectations of privacy are by social science data, get my law clerks to go do that, or do we just announce normatively what we think it ought to be? Should it depend on regional and cultural norms across the country? Gosh, it's very complicated. Professors Baude and Stern, among many others, suggest maybe we ought to look back at that property test again. What do you think? Well, Mr. Feigin -- Mr. Feigin, you keep saying that, but as a matter of property law now and forever, a possessor would have a right to exclude other people but for those with better title. So someone in these position would have a right, I think you'd agree, to exclude someone who's attempting to get in the car to hijack it, carjack it. You'd also have a right to throw out a hitchhiker who had overstayed his welcome. And so as -- I think you're having to argue that the government has a special license that doesn't exist for any other stranger to the car. Well, that's been -- that's been the common law of property forever, right? I'm not talking about thieves. We put that aside. Inconceivable with respect to thieves. That's correct. I'm asking with respect to everybody else. Isn't it the fact that the government is asking for a special license here that would not be available to any other third person? Well, then let me ask you this: Do you agree that -- that Mr. Byrd could have excluded a carjacker? By virtue of his possession -- Yes, and -- and -- -- he would have a right to do so. And he would have a right to throw out a hitchhiker as well. So why not the government? Mr. Feigin. One thing we're struggling with here is you say some contract terms are so common, kind of an empirical argument, that we should take cognizance of them. On the other hand, you kind of make a normative argument that some contract terms we should disregard even if they are common, like the cell phone breach. Listening to a cell phone while driving shouldn't forfeit your expectations of privacy as a normative matter, even though, empirically, they're quite common. The government's been living with the reasonable expectation of privacy test for a long time. How much of it is supposed to be empirical? How much of it is supposed to be normative? And how are we supposed to decide? You -- you've made several times this argument that it's very common, that anyone in the country would know that this is a breach, and that that, therefore, informs the reasonable expectation of privacy test. That's an empirical claim. You've also normatively made the argument that there are some breaches, though common, we should not take cognizance of, we should not forfeit Fourth Amendment rights on, like the cell phone example. And I'm asking you, the government's been living with the Katz rule for 50 years. How much of it's empirical, how much of it's normative, and how are we supposed to decide? No, if you could get to that straight away. I know that. I'm not asking you that either, Mr. Feigin. ",mr loeb if i can if i can follow up on on justice sotomayor s question and and justice breyer s in term of what be the clear line we can draw here you have raise two theory on which you might prevail one a property law theory essentially as i understand it that possession be good title against everybody except for people with superior title and and i understand that that be an ancient common law rule i can go back and find that in treatise all the way back to joseph story or i can do this reasonable expectation of privacy test and that be what we have be struggle with so far what be the we have to ask what the nature of the contract be and the term of the contract we might want to look at the nature of the relationship between mr byrd and and ms reed there be a lot of debate in the brief over whether they be girlfriend and boyfriend or fiance or maybe common law marriage and someone s cheating on someone else all of that be in the brief that we have to contend with then we have the question whether the test be even an empirical or a normative question do we look at what the reasonable expectation of privacy be by social science data get my law clerk to go do that or do we just announce normatively what we think it ought to be should it depend on regional and cultural norm across the country gosh it be very complicate professor baude and stern among many others suggest maybe we ought to look back at that property test again what do you think well mr feigin mr feigin you keep say that but as a matter of property law now and forever a possessor would have a right to exclude other people but for those with good title so someone in these position would have a right i think you would agree to exclude someone who be attempt to get in the car to hijack it carjack it you would also have a right to throw out a hitchhiker who have overstay his welcome and so as i think you be have to argue that the government have a special license that do not exist for any other stranger to the car well that be be that be be the common law of property forever right I be not talk about thief we put that aside inconceivable with respect to thief that be correct I be ask with respect to everybody else be not it the fact that the government be ask for a special license here that would not be available to any other third person well then let me ask you this do you agree that that mr byrd could have exclude a carjacker by virtue of his possession yes and and he would have a right to do so and he would have a right to throw out a hitchhiker as well so why not the government mr feigin one thing we be struggle with here be you say some contract term be so common kind of an empirical argument that we should take cognizance of them on the other hand you kind of make a normative argument that some contract term we should disregard even if they be common like the cell phone breach listen to a cell phone while drive should not forfeit your expectation of privacy as a normative matter even though empirically they be quite common the government s be live with the reasonable expectation of privacy test for a long time how much of it be suppose to be empirical how much of it be suppose to be normative and how be we suppose to decide you you have make several time this argument that it be very common that anyone in the country would know that this be a breach and that that therefore inform the reasonable expectation of privacy test that be an empirical claim you have also normatively make the argument that there be some breach though common we should not take cognizance of we should not forfeit fourth amendment right on like the cell phone example and I be ask you the government s be live with the katz rule for year how much of it be empirical how much of it be normative and how be we suppose to decide no if you could get to that straight away i know that I be not ask you that either mr feigin ,224.0,Roberts Court,"Jan 9, 2018",Terrence Byrd,United States of America,16-1371,"Sep 28, 2017","May 14, 2018",115.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2017,Currier v. Virginia,115,Neil Gorsuch,"Mr. Fisher, are we confident that civil issue preclusion would apply in circumstances like these, where a party consents to a bifurcated trial, or might it be more law of the case where it's more equitable? I know you cite an old Tenth Circuit case suggesting issue preclusion might apply here, but it's -- it's a malleable doctrine even in the civil context. And when a party consents to two trials, it may or may not apply. And law of the case, if it's the same jury and bifurcated, it -- it very well might not. So what do we do about that? An unpublished New York district court opinion. Yeah. But you'd agree in civil cases -- or maybe you wouldn't, tell me if I'm wrong -- that in civil cases it's not a foregone conclusion that issue preclusion would apply in these circumstances. It might be law of the case, and it might be subject to some consideration about the defendant's consent? I mean -- -- you'd agree that your research did not prove that this would be obviously precluded even in a -- in a civil matter? Fair -- Fair enough. Yeah. Well, what do we do about -- What do we do about the fact that claim preclusion in the criminal context isn't as robust, in the criminal context, under Blockburger as it would be in the civil context? We use a transaction test in the civil context and an elements test in the criminal context. We shouldn't be concerned that it's anomalous that it would be creating a -- an issue preclusion doctrine that may be more robust than in the civil context here, even though in claim preclusion it's less robust? Mr. Fisher, what's your second point?

2017,SAS Institute Inc. v. Iancu,115,Neil Gorsuch,"But doesn't that exactly work the other way around? Of course, by the end, you're only going to resolve the challenges that -- that remain pending. When you're doing the institution decision of inter partes review, you're going to look at the petition. Couldn't it be just that simple? And doesn't 314 kind of cut against the government in some ways too by suggesting that all the PTO needs to do is decide whether there is one claim that isn't frivolous, that's -- that's the sum total of its job under the plain terms. And that -- and that beyond that, it need not go further. Right. It's what -- what's left. So that's why there's a difference in language there, you agree? Okay. But -- but how then do we deal with the fact that in 314, we have all the -- all the PTO has to do is decide whether there is one non-frivolous claim. It's a thumbs-up or a thumbs-down decision -- -- that's anticipated there, not a -- not a claim-by-claim examination. No. Well, help me -- help me out with 316 then if that's where you're going to go to. Where do you -- where do you see the authority for the regulations that the director is proscribed here? Now, (a)(4), that -- my problem with that, where I get stuck is that (a)(4) concerns establishing a governing inter partes review. And we're not at that stage yet. We're at the decision whether to institute inter partes review. I would have thought you'd have to look to -- to (a)(2) rather than (a)(4). I'd agree with you to cover -- you've given great discussion on the standards for showing sufficient grounds to institute a review. I'm not sure, I guess I'm -- you can help me on how that also includes the authority whether to grant review of this or that claim, the weeding out process. I can see how it might affect the reasonable likelihood inquiry and how the director is going to go about doing that, but I -- I guess it's a little less clear to me how it also grants him authority, or her authority, to decide which claims to proceed with. Yeah. Well, but -- but 314(a) seems to proscribe that -- that question, at least with respect to one claim. It speaks to that very issue. Is there some inconsistency with 304 where you're allowed -- the director gets to decide which question specifically the director wants to take up? There seems to be an express grant to the director there to do exactly what you want to do here. And is its absence here suggestive? It's not just claims in 304, it's questions. And so the director can pick and choose which questions. And is granted that express authority. And normally we -- we think that when it's granted in one place but not clearly granted in the other that that -- that that intends a difference. What do you say about our -- our last argument, where a lot of our attention focused on Congress's putative intention to -- to want to move things to an expert agency and -- and speed things along, make it more efficient? Could -- could that be a reason here why Congress might have wanted the Patent Office to review any -- and -- and issue a final decision on any and all claims brought to it? No, I -- no, surely, not necessarily efficient from the -- the PTO's perspective, but efficient from the economy's perspective. But it could do what Justice Kennedy said. That -- that would -- everybody agrees would remain an available choice. Well, it would require consent by the -- by the litigant in that case, whereas here, this litigant took the view that I really want an adjudication on everything that -- would it be crazy to suppose that Congress might have wanted that as a way to achieve maximum efficiency through this administrative process? For the -- from the economy's perspective? It can -- -- it can still do that through ex parte proceedings reviewability on its own anytime, right? Those are -- those still exist? They -- Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Right, right.

2017,Carpenter v. United States,115,Neil Gorsuch,"Just, Mr. -- Mr. Wessler, along those lines, one more kind of technical question. There was a suggestion in the briefs that some of this information is required to be kept by governmental regulation, the E911 program. Do you have any insight on that for us? Mr. Wessler, I'm sorry, one quick question. Focusing on the property-based approach, putting aside reasonable expectation for just a moment, what do we know about what state law would say about this information? So say -- say a thief broke into T-Mobile, stole this information and sought to make economic value of it. Would you have a conversion -- would your client have a conversion claim, for example, under state law? Have you explored that at all? Uh-huh. No, I understand 222. I've got that argument. I'm just wondering have you -- have state courts developed this at all? Right. Right. Okay. Thank you. Mr. Dreeben, I'd like to -- I'd like to drill down on that and return to Justice Kagan's question. You know, the facts here wind up looking a lot like Jones. One thing Jones -- Jones taught us is -- and reminded us, really, is that the property-based approach to privacy also has to be considered, not just the reasonable expectation approach. So, if we put aside the reasonable expectation approach for just a moment, Katz, Miller, Smith, and ask what is the property right here, let's say there is a property right. Let's say I have a property right in the conversion case I posited with your colleague, so that if someone were to steal my location information from T-Mobile I'd have a conversion claim, for example, against them for the economic value that was stolen. Wouldn't that, therefore, be a search of my paper or effect under the property-based approach approved and reminded us in Jones? Right. Okay. But let's just -- let's -- -- let's stick with my hypothetical, counsel, okay? I know you don't like it. I got that. (Laughter.) But let's say that, in fact, I've got positive law that indicates it is a property right. Would you there -- therefore, agree that that's a search of my paper and effect? But why not? If property law says it is. Well, that's fighting the hypothetical, counsel. And I know I -- I didn't like hypotheticals, too, when I was a lawyer sometimes, but I'm asking you to stick with my hypothetical. All right. Please -- please, could you stick with my hypothetical and then you can tell me why it's wrong. Under my hypothetical, you have a property right in this information. Would it be a search of my paper and effect? Yes or no. You're not here to deny that there might be a property interest and, therefore, a search? In my -- in my hypothetical, if there were a property interest, you're not here to deny that that would be a search of my paper and effect? Okay. I think you -- Well, what does Section 222 do, other than declare this customer proprietary network information -- -- that the carrier cannot disclose? So -- so, but let me ask you that. So -- so the government can acknowledge a property right but then strip it of any Fourth Amendment protection. Is that the government's position? And so -- so could we also say maybe that they also get this property right subject to having a non-Article III judge decide the case, or quartering of troops in your home? Could we strip your property interests of all constitutional protection? Are they? But does Congress's determination also yield in the face of the Fourth Amendment, Mr. Dreeben? It does not. The Fourth Amendment is trumped by this statute? In the government's -- in the government's view. Is that -- is that right? The statute trumps the Fourth Amendment? Oh, good. All right. I hoped so. So the Fourth Amendment controls, not -- not what the statute says -- -- with respect to the disclosure of the information? Right. The statute creates customer proprietary information -- -- in Section 222 and then the Fourth Amendment will determine when it can be revealed. Right? Why does the statute control the Constitution? I think you are saying the statute controls the Constitution. So the bitter -- the bitter with the sweet. So -- so why -- -- why -- why -- why couldn't Congress also say you don't get an Article III judge to determine this issue? Mr. Dreeben, it seems like your whole argument boils down to if we get it from a third-party we're okay, regardless of property interest, regardless of anything else. But how does that fit with the original understanding of the Constitution and writs of assistance? You know, John Adams said one of the reasons for the war was the -- the use by the government of third parties to obtain information -- force them to help as their snitches and snoops. Why -- why isn't this argument exactly what the framers were concerned about? Isn't that exactly your argument here, that so long as a third party's involved, we can get anything we want? The subpoena -- -- being, though, the equivalent of a writ of assistance? Yeah. And -- and you can subpoena -- -- anything that any company has anywhere in the globe regardless of any property rights, regardless of any privacy interests, simply because it's a third-party?

2017,Rosales-Mireles v. United States,115,Neil Gorsuch,"Ms. Davidson, I was wondering about our -- our standard in Olano and the fourth prong, talking about fairness, reputation, integrity of judicial proceedings, where it came from. And I traced it back to Atkinson, a 1936 opinion. I know you've cited that. And I wanted your thoughts about that, because in Atkinson, it said district courts should be guided by the following test in when to exercise their discretion to correct a plain error and suggested that they should correct a plain error whenever it's obvious or when it affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. And Olano turned that ""or"" into an ""and."" What do we make of that? Well, if that's true on the fourth prong, public reputation, let's say, how are we supposed to determine that normatively, right? As an empirical matter. We're supposed to take a poll? I think if we took a poll, we'd find that a lot of people may not care about how long your client spends in prison. Right? Whether it's an extra six months or not. Should that matter? Should public reputation in a -- in a -- in a institution that's designed to check majoritarian impulses like the judiciary's supposed to, should -- should those majoritarian influences even matter in our consideration of the fourth prong? So it's a normative inquiry rather than an empirical one, I think is what you're suggesting, in which case, should -- should the fact that a person spends a day in prison longer than the law permits be something we should care about? That we made ourselves? Isn't it -- I'm sorry. No, please. (Laughter.) You're doing a much better job than I. (Laughter.) Well, Mr. Ellis, if -- if -- along those lines, though, Congress did speak to this question, the feedback loop problem that Justice Breyer has been alluding to, in 3742(f)(1), where it said if there's an error in calculating the sentencing guideline, the case shall be remanded. Not -- not ""may."" I take it you'd have us read ""shall"" to mean ""may."" So -- well, you haven't -- you haven't suggested that the statute's ineffectual, have you? You'd have us just ignore the statute then? I think those are your choices. We either ignore the statute or we read ""shall"" to mean ""may."" Have you got a third option? Okay. So what's the third option? Before you -- before we leave that, I'd just like to nail this down -- -- because the harmless error rule makes sense to me in Williams in light -- in light of the language because the court has to determine the sentence was imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing guideline, and if it's harmless, it wasn't imposed as a result of. But how do you -- how do you get plain error into this rule? How do you get, you know, that problem solved? Without turning ""shall"" into ""may"" or ignoring the statute all together? If we're going to compare the -- the cost empirically of the two systems, wouldn't we have to account for the fact that under the regime you propose there are a lot more appeals that the courts of appeals have to resolve? In the circuits where this rule exists or this presumption exists, the government frequently confesses error to mathematical mistakes in the guidelines applications and it automatically goes back for resentencing without the need of -- of appellate resources being involved. Should that be a cost that we should consider or -- or is that one you would have us ignore? Are you including the fourth prong as well? It's irrelevant there too? That's -- that's just an argument against the plain error rule all together, isn't it?

As you know, trustees can avoid transfers leading up to the bankruptcy that meet certain conditions.

So that a lot of avoidable transactions would become unavoidable all of a sudden. How do we reconcile your -- your interpretation with that -- that apparent difficulty? Well, but often -- -- often a transfer that's avoidable does involve a financial institution. You'd agree with that, surely? May, but -- Well, but it could -- Well, but it could. I mean, why not? I mean, do you have any empirical information on that? No. So not -- a triviality we don't need to worry about, even though it was a central feature of the Seventh Circuit's opinion?

So -- but, Mr. Clement, on that, I assume your friend will get up and say, well, a lot of those charitable contributions are by check, and those aren't covered.

So how -- how clean a line is this really? I mean, what -- what you're suggesting? Yeah. Customer. Right. Yeah. The amici -- the amici give us a very clean position, right, that we need a transferee under the statute and a debtor under the statute. I read the red brief as being a little more equivocal on that. Maybe I misread it. Did you endorse the amici's clean position without qualification? Yeah. All right. All right. But the Second Circuit is very concerned about the effect that this would have on the leveraged buyout industry and -- and, therefore, the economy more broadly.

2017,"Jesner v. Arab Bank, PLC",115,Neil Gorsuch,"Mr. Fisher -- -- looking back to 1789, as Sosa indicates we should, beyond extraterritoriality, did it also anticipate that there's an American defendant in the case? Professor Bellia and Clark argue that that's exactly what was in mind, was some action by an American citizen that might be tagged to the United States itself and be cause for just war by a foreign power, and that that was the purpose of the ATS. So what do you say about that? And then relatedly, if international law was not part of the federal law itself in 1789, and I think there is an argument that that's what the Congress understood too, then don't you need an American defendant in order to have diversity jurisdiction? Well, you've got the ambassador provision as well, which is a separate part of the Constitution. And the ATS was arguably meant to do more than cover ambassadors. But if you -- I think we have a separate statute in -- in 1789 to deal with that issue too. So that's -- that doesn't answer my question. But can you answer my question about what the expectation was in 1789 -- -- Sosa tells us it should govern our review of the statute. I don't doubt that's what we've -- some -- some have suggested since then, but do we know that was the understanding of Congress in 1789? It seems like Professor Bellia, Clark, others have argued -- Goldsmith, suggested maybe otherwise. If that's the case, then -- then you've got federal question jurisdiction and what's the point of the ATS? But today you have 1331, right? So -- And, counsel, might that be because it's a -- an American defendant against whom the United States might be chargeable for a just war? Wasn't -- what do you say to that scholarship that suggests that that's the key to the idea of -- of what causes friction and alien versus alien causes of action aren't within the statute? Well -- You have the ambassador clause there that's separate and that -- you had a separate statute to deal with that exact problem in 1789. And this was to deal with something else, an additional beyond the ambassadorial problem. You've got -- you've got Professor Bellia, Professor Clark, a whole bunch of really interesting scholarship on this point, and I'm just wondering what -- what the government's point of view is on it. It wasn't addressed, though, and -- and I don't think it's been foreclosed necessarily either. I mean, it's certainly true we took the view that courts in America can apply general international law, sure, but I'm not sure it's -- it's addressed this specific theory of the ATS. Okay. Right. Well, if it didn't address that one, what do you say to it? But there's another statute that does. So -- so what? But it might explain why this statute exists in addition to that other one. Ambassadorial -- Ambassadors. But why is that? Right. But if -- if we're not responsible for it, it wouldn't be the cause of a just war against us and, therefore, not a cause of concern under the ATS. Oh, good. So the first one we can put aside. As plaintiffs, yes. And the argument I have been developing isn't mine. I can't take credit for it. But it's a very careful argument that has been developed that that is exactly what those words meant to the First Congress. Right. But -- but the plain text is the law of nations. And the argument, and I'm not doing it justice -- -- but is briefly that a law of nations would have meant something that would have been attributed to the United States.

2017,"South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc.",115,Neil Gorsuch,"So even if -- I -- I -- I don't think you've quite addressed Justice Ginsburg's question, though, which is brick-and-mortar retailers, if they choose to operate in any given jurisdiction, have to comply with that jurisdiction. There are a lot of retailers that have to comply with lots of different jurisdictions' rules. Why should we favor, this Court favor, a particular business model that relies not on brick and mortar but on mail order? I understand in Bellas Hess the Court was concerned about a nascent, small mail order industry. Those concerns seem a little antiquated today. So maybe if you could address, Justice Ginsburg's question is the same one I have, so anything you might say on that would be helpful. I accept that, but it's still not responsive, counsel. You're -- you're -- you're just merely pointing out that more Internet retailers are moving toward brick and mortar. Fine. But, again, why should this Court favor those who don't over those who do? That's the question. Not necessarily. Well, but it starts at $12. We know that too. Right? So that figure seems a little misleading. I guess the real question that I think Justice Breyer is maybe getting at, and I'd love your help on this too, is the comparative difference. Right? After Quill, now states may force Internet providers to provide information, like Colorado does, that enable them to collect tax from the taxpayer. So the real delta here isn't no duty at all on the Internet supplier versus collecting sales taxes. It's something like Colorado's regime versus collecting sales tax. Do you have any information at all as to which is the lesser burden? I've wondered whether the Colorado regime might be more burdensome to clients like yours who do sales over the Internet than just simply collecting the sales tax itself. Do you have any data on that? Is there anything at all that tells us that? When you say -- I'm sorry. Is the same true of Colorado's reporting requirements? I mean, if we're going to compare barriers to entry, we have to compare apples to apples. And -- and so we wouldn't compare it necessarily against a baseline of nothing. We'd have to compare it against the reporting requirements of a state like Colorado's. So do you know what the difference, the delta there is?

I would think textually, you'd have a very difficult time drawing a line around embassies. I mean, you -- you suggest we might do that. I suppose we can do just about anything. But, textually, I don't see how you make that argument. I would think consulates, trade offices, tourism offices that are part of the ministry would all be included, I would think, under your interpretation. Well, I'm positing all sorts of different kinds of entities that are also -- -- directly in communication with and responsible to ultimately the foreign minister. So I'm not sure textually how I wouldn't qualify. A second question if I might. What do we do about the fourth subsection, which does specify diplomatic means, addressed to the Secretary of State, if you -- if you failed under 3, you go to 4, and 4 says then you send it to the secretary of state here in Washington, the United States Secretary of State, and -- and the Secretary will then use diplomatic means to get it to the appropriate folks. And when Congress speaks so clearly about the question of diplomatic means in one place, we tend to usually think it's excluded elsewhere. What do we do about that? I understand that argument. That's not my question. All right. All right. Now let's -- let's get to the question, all right? We understand that the State Department is large. My question is just, it speaks there that the Secretary will then use diplomatic means to get the service effected. And there is an express discussion of diplomatic means. And its presence in (4) would suggest its absence in (3) was not accidental under our normal canons of interpretation. Now I'm telling you something you already know. So what's the -- what's the answer to it? Let's -- let's say I disagree with that. But -- but -- but -- but your reading of (3) is that it has to get to the foreign minister. And the only way it can get to the foreign minister, you say it will happen effectively and with great dispatch, if I give it to the embassy and maybe a few other places.

2018,United States v. Stitt,115,Neil Gorsuch,"Well -- Well, counsel, I'm not sure how that helps you, because you've identified, first of all, that only 12 states are at issue, which seems to me a strike against the government here, as to suggest that this was what Congress had in mind in 1984/'86. Second, the -- the statute at least in Arkansas is disjunctive, right? It says a -- a place customarily used to -- to live, which might be your -- line up with the Tennessee statute and suggest some sort of customization or change. But then it uses ""lives in."" And that doesn't connote any changes to the vehicle itself at all. That could be sleeping in the back of -- of a car, nothing more. And I wonder, under your interpretation, about this hypothetical, let's say someone breaks into such a car where someone's living, a homeless person or someone crossing the country, to steal a flip phone. That would be burglary, I -- I think you'd say, and the ACCA would kick in and 15 years might -- might follow as a sentence. Compared to the person who tows away the same car without entering it and commits a theft, that would just be a common law theft and -- with no -- no attendant problem, even though maybe an arguably greater harm has occurred. What do you think about that? Well, if the car is empty and no one's around, it's -- it's quite unlike a home. You don't know what you're going to enter -- what you're going to find when you enter. A car, you can look in and see. So there's no risk of violent encounter in either of my hypotheticals. So I modified my hypothetical for you there. Now what? I'm -- I'm sure he's going to dispute that. We've been around the numbers game already this morning. I'm sure we'll be around it again. But how many states in 1986 had anything like a lives-in statute? It seems to me an exceedingly small number you've cited to us. It sure sounds to me like you've turned those two prongs into one, made them superfluous. Well, I'd like you to return to Justice Breyer's original question. I know you want to run straight to this case, and I appreciate that, but -- but live with us for a moment in the unease of the more general concern that Justice Breyer raised. If you survey circuit judges across the country about one gripe they have with this Court's jurisprudence, it may be the ACCA you'd hear a lot. And the -- maybe the fourth option I sometimes hear is why not do an Erie, instead of Swift versus Tyson, and say, well, if the state calls it robbery, if the state calls it burglary, then it's robbery or burglary. And I'd be curious, and -- and I'm not holding you to any of it, but has the department given any thought to any of these options that Justice Breyer has outlined or that I've just added? Please. Well, this was -- this was raised pretty late in the day, this argument about the Arkansas statute and ""living in."" And given that -- and given our decision in Duenas, why don't we do exactly what Justice Alito is suggesting and just remand it and let -- let the lower courts figure it out? Maybe they can certify it to the Arkansas Supreme Court and figure this out. I'll spot you all of that. I'm -- I'm with you. (Laughter.) But it -- the -- the Eighth Circuit didn't have a chance to consider this particular argument about living in. And it's a -- it's a -- it's a nifty little argument, but maybe we'd benefit from being a court of review rather than first view on it. ",well well counsel I be not sure how that help you because you have identify first of all that only state be at issue which seem to me a strike against the government here as to suggest that this be what congress have in mind in second the the statute at least in arkansas be disjunctive right it say a a place customarily use to to live which might be your line up with the tennessee statute and suggest some sort of customization or change but then it use life in and that do not connote any change to the vehicle itself at all that could be sleep in the back of of a car nothing more and i wonder under your interpretation about this hypothetical let us say someone break into such a car where someone s living a homeless person or someone cross the country to steal a flip phone that would be burglary i i think you would say and the acca would kick in and year might might follow as a sentence compare to the person who tow away the same car without enter it and commit a theft that would just be a common law theft and with no no attendant problem even though maybe an arguably great harm have occur what do you think about that well if the car be empty and no one s around it be it be quite unlike a home you do not know what you be go to enter what you be go to find when you enter a car you can look in and see so there be no risk of violent encounter in either of my hypothetical so i modify my hypothetical for you there now what I be I be sure he be go to dispute that we have be around the number game already this morning I be sure we will be around it again but how many state in have anything like a life in statute it seem to me an exceedingly small number you have cite to us it sure sound to me like you have turn those two prong into one make them superfluous well I would like you to return to justice breyer s original question i know you want to run straight to this case and i appreciate that but but live with us for a moment in the unease of the more general concern that justice breyer raise if you survey circuit judge across the country about one gripe they have with this court s jurisprudence it may be the acca you would hear a lot and the maybe the fourth option i sometimes hear be why not do an erie instead of swift versus tyson and say well if the state call it robbery if the state call it burglary then it be robbery or burglary and I would be curious and and I be not hold you to any of it but have the department give any thought to any of these option that justice breyer have outline or that I have just add please well this be this be raise pretty late in the day this argument about the arkansas statute and living in and give that and give our decision in duenas why do not we do exactly what justice alito be suggest and just remand it and let let the low court figure it out maybe they can certify it to the arkansas supreme court and figure this out I will spot you all of that I be I be with you laughter but it the the eighth circuit do not have a chance to consider this particular argument about living in and it be a it be a it be a nifty little argument but maybe we would benefit from be a court of review rather than first view on it ,196.92,Roberts Court,"Oct 9, 2018",United States of America,"Victor J.

2018,"Knick v. Township of Scott, Pennsylvania",115,Neil Gorsuch,"Counsel, I -- I -- -- I think this gets back to Justice Breyer's question a little bit, which is you could say that the violation is complete upon the taking of the property with the denial of compensation, as Justice Alito just alluded to, and you've just denied that any compensation is due. Or you could say it should wait until a state litigation process has exhausted itself. And maybe it makes sense to wait when the state has acknowledged a duty to pay, and we can say the state's probably good for it. And that's where those cases originally came from, Cherokee and some of the early ones. But maybe -- maybe it doesn't make sense when the state has denied any obligation to pay. Maybe -- maybe it makes -- maybe it is different when it's an inverse condemnation, because when we look at other -- other constitutional rights, we don't say that a First Amendment violation isn't complete until someone has litigated that claim in state court under state processes or a Fourth Amendment claim. And when you look at the history of inverse condemnation suits, they originated in common law under trespass. It's a simple claim against the state for trespass. That's what an inverse condemnation suit is. Nothing more, nothing less. So why should we single out the -- this particular right, the takings clause, for such disfavored treatment to wait to exhaust state remedies that wind up in this ripeness world to yield a moot federal claim? But we could say the exact -- -- same thing with a Fourth Amendment claim or a First Amendment claim. There are a lot of great state judges out there, every bit as good as any federal judge. And there are a lot of state tort claims that are available equivalent to the trespass claim of an inverse condemnation suit. Why don't we wait to see how they adjudicate a Fourth Amendment violation by a police officer who's engaged in excessive force? Why don't we wait for -- when the prosecutor's engaged in malicious prosecution? We don't because 1983 says you don't have to wait. Why not here? Well, but, counsel, that's not -- that's not quite what's at issue, of course. We're just talking about a remedial regime in either case, a suit in federal court or a suit in state court. And I would have thought presumably the answer would be that the state's conduct would be the same in either circumstance. You'd be prepared to pay just compensation for takings, and prepared not to pay just compensation where there is no taking, and it wouldn't matter whether the claim's in federal court or state court. Isn't that right? ",counsel i i i think this get back to justice breyer s question a little bit which be you could say that the violation be complete upon the taking of the property with the denial of compensation as justice alito just allude to and you have just deny that any compensation be due or you could say it should wait until a state litigation process have exhaust itself and maybe it make sense to wait when the state have acknowledge a duty to pay and we can say the state s probably good for it and that be where those case originally come from cherokee and some of the early one but maybe maybe it do not make sense when the state have deny any obligation to pay maybe maybe it make maybe it be different when it be an inverse condemnation because when we look at other other constitutional right we do not say that a first amendment violation be not complete until someone have litigate that claim in state court under state process or a fourth amendment claim and when you look at the history of inverse condemnation suit they originate in common law under trespass it be a simple claim against the state for trespass that be what an inverse condemnation suit be nothing more nothing less so why should we single out the this particular right the taking clause for such disfavored treatment to wait to exhaust state remedy that wind up in this ripeness world to yield a moot federal claim but we could say the exact same thing with a fourth amendment claim or a first amendment claim there be a lot of great state judge out there every bit as good as any federal judge and there be a lot of state tort claim that be available equivalent to the trespass claim of an inverse condemnation suit why do not we wait to see how they adjudicate a fourth amendment violation by a police officer who be engage in excessive force why do not we wait for when the prosecutor s engage in malicious prosecution we do not because say you do not have to wait why not here well but counsel that be not that be not quite what be at issue of course we be just talk about a remedial regime in either case a suit in federal court or a suit in state court and i would have think presumably the answer would be that the state s conduct would be the same in either circumstance you would be prepare to pay just compensation for taking and prepare not to pay just compensation where there be no taking and it would not matter whether the claim s in federal court or state court be not that right ,150.72,Case pending,"Oct 3, 2018",Rose Mary Knick,"Township of Scott, Pennsylvania",17-647,"Mar 5, 2018",,115.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2018,Culbertson v. Berryhill,115,Neil Gorsuch,"Counsel, on that on the incentive structure point, I -- I -- I can surely understand the impulse, and I feel that the 25 percent's quite a lot, even if past-due benefits, I know future benefits are untouched, and that's a sympathetic position. But couldn't a rational Congress also think that there are some extraordinary cases that are hard and in order to incentivize attorneys more might be appropriate, in order -- I mean, if you overregulate, you create scarcity, right? And if you overregulate the availability of attorneys, nobody's going to take the case. And so, here, isn't it at least conceivable that a rational Congress might think there would be an odd case where you need above 25 percent, up to 50, but we're going to put in special checks, a reasonableness inquiry at the administrative level and a reasonableness inquiry at the district court, all of which is subject to further review, I'm sure. So why -- why -- why is that an irrational scheme to provide incentive structures so that people do have representation and that there isn't artificial scarcity? Okay. So your argument is that on the text you win -- -- but as a matter of policy you admit it's a draw? You admit a reasonable Congress could worry about that scenario? But, counsel, I think what Justice Breyer's getting at, and I think it's a premise of my question too, is, isn't it fair to say that in a -- in a significant number of cases that future benefits are larger than past benefits? But isn't that exactly the hardest cases where you maybe are most in need of good legal services and lawyers might be least likely to participate? But you would agree with the premise that -- that these are the cases, these are the hardest cases where attorneys are most useful perhaps? Yeah. They've lost below. They've lost below.

2018,Azar v. Allina Health Services,115,Neil Gorsuch,"Mr. Kneedler, this is where I get stuck. And I'm -- I'm -- I'm focusing more on the language of the statute, I confess, than -- than the history, which I've read but I -- I find confused, as Justice Breyer suggests. So (a)(2) says that any rule, requirement, or other statement of policy that establishes a substantive legal change has to go through informal rulemaking, not even formal rulemaking. And so, really, the question all boils down to what does ""substantive"" mean, I think, as -- as -- as I understand it. And the import of that in the government's view is that it's binding, as opposed to an interpretive rule, borrowing language from the APA. And your friend on the other side reads substantive, as it's often read elsewhere in the law, as material or affecting private rights, as opposed to procedural. And both seem to me pretty plausible interpretations of that word. And -- and the strikes against you, as I see it from the text of the statute, are a few. First, the statute speaks of statements of policy as being substantive. But, of course, in APA language, statements of policy are interpretive. They're not substantive. They don't bind the agency in any reasonable sense. It speaks of substantive changes in an interpretive rule in (e). And, of course, that's like a -- a complete incoherent statement in APA language, but entirely coherent in the language of the law if ""substantive"" means material. And then, of course, the statute also adopts the APA good faith -- the good clause exception to -- to -- to rulemaking verbatim. And it clearly doesn't adopt the substantive interpretive language verbatim, which is right next door in -- in the APA. I mean, it's the next section. And you're asking us to think that Congress recreated that section in this statute through this rather oblique mechanism. So, there, I've put my cards on the table. Tell me where I've gone wrong. Mr. Kneedler, there's a lot of words there, but I'm not sure there's an answer to Justice Kagan's question. So I'm -- I'm going to give you an opportunity to try again, because it's very important to me as well. Aren't you using the word ""substantive"" in two different senses, first in the APA's -- what I call the APA sense in (a), and then what I'll call the other traditional legal sense in (e)? So you're conceding to your colleague on the other side that it is used in that sense at least in (e), I believe. Substantive -- it says substantive change to an interpretive rule. Which is a nonsense under your view, I believe. Again, a lot of words, but I think at the end of the day you are agreeing that Congress is using that word in two different senses, right? What would be the -- What would be the point -- What would be the point of that, though, if a statement of policy couldn't have operative legal effect on anyone anyway? I mean, a party would simply say that's just a statement of policy. Have a nice day. Well, then it's not a statement -- then the argument would be it's not a statement of policy, right? Okay. It's entirely superfluous? It does nothing? It does nothing new? But substantively -- sorry -- it does nothing new? It reiterates, okay. It reiterates what's already the law -- -- which is to say it is superfluous. Can I -- can I take you -- Can I take you back just to one other problem I have? You want us to -- to -- to view this statute as very carefully using APA terminology when it comes to substantive. But, when it comes to statements of policy, you want us to ignore the fact that what -- what the APA -- how it treats them and say even faux statements of policy that are really rules and requirements and regulations, that's what it's aiming at. Isn't that a problem for you too? Well, on that -- on that -- -- on that -- on that, though, I don't doubt it's more convenient for the government to proceed through adjudication of an individual case and announce a new rule that applies to the whole of society without inviting comment and providing notice to everyone affected. Surely, I -- I get that that's easier and preferable, certainly more efficient. But couldn't Congress make rationally an alternative decision that informal rulemaking, not even formal rulemaking, that's gone by the boards, but just informal notice and comment to affected parties in something as significant as changing the formula for Medicare for all Medicare providers nationwide, that maybe they should have 60 days to at least throw in their comments. But why -- why is that? In Chenery II, this Court did allow the government to engage in retroactive adjudications that affect substantive rights, but expected that it would be a rare thing that that would happen and that most of these kinds of actions would happen through rulemaking. This, of course, is the Court's -- the government's claiming the power to affect every Medicare provider in the country retroactively through these seriatim adjudications. Why is -- why is this extraordinary? ",mr kneedler this be where i get stick and I be I be I be focus more on the language of the statute i confess than than the history which I have read but i i find confused as justice breyer suggest so a say that any rule requirement or other statement of policy that establish a substantive legal change have to go through informal rulemaking not even formal rulemaking and so really the question all boil down to what do substantive mean i think as as as i understand it and the import of that in the government s view be that it be bind as oppose to an interpretive rule borrow language from the apa and your friend on the other side read substantive as it be often read elsewhere in the law as material or affect private right as oppose to procedural and both seem to me pretty plausible interpretation of that word and and the strike against you as i see it from the text of the statute be a few first the statute speaks of statement of policy as be substantive but of course in apa language statement of policy be interpretive they be not substantive they do not bind the agency in any reasonable sense it speak of substantive change in an interpretive rule in e and of course that be like a a complete incoherent statement in apa language but entirely coherent in the language of the law if substantive mean material and then of course the statute also adopt the apa good faith the good clause exception to to to rulemaking verbatim and it clearly do not adopt the substantive interpretive language verbatim which be right next door in in the apa i mean it be the next section and you be ask us to think that congress recreate that section in this statute through this rather oblique mechanism so there I have put my card on the table tell me where I have go wrong mr kneedler there be a lot of word there but I be not sure there be an answer to justice kagan s question so I be I be go to give you an opportunity to try again because it be very important to me as well be not you use the word substantive in two different sens first in the apa s what i call the apa sense in a and then what I will call the other traditional legal sense in e so you be concede to your colleague on the other side that it be use in that sense at least in e i believe substantive it say substantive change to an interpretive rule which be a nonsense under your view i believe again a lot of word but i think at the end of the day you be agree that congress be use that word in two different sens right what would be the what would be the point what would be the point of that though if a statement of policy could not have operative legal effect on anyone anyway i mean a party would simply say that be just a statement of policy have a nice day well then it be not a statement then the argument would be it be not a statement of policy right okay it be entirely superfluous it do nothing it do nothing new but substantively sorry it do nothing new it reiterate okay it reiterate what be already the law which be to say it be superfluous can i can i take you can i take you back just to one other problem i have you want us to to to view this statute as very carefully use apa terminology when it come to substantive but when it come to statement of policy you want us to ignore the fact that what what the apa how it treat them and say even faux statement of policy that be really rule and requirement and regulation that be what it be aim at be not that a problem for you too well on that on that on that on that though i do not doubt it be more convenient for the government to proceed through adjudication of an individual case and announce a new rule that apply to the whole of society without invite comment and provide notice to everyone affect surely i i get that that be easy and preferable certainly more efficient but could not congress make rationally an alternative decision that informal rulemaking not even formal rulemaking that be go by the board but just informal notice and comment to affected party in something as significant as change the formula for medicare for all medicare provider nationwide that maybe they should have day to at least throw in their comment but why why be that in chenery ii this court do allow the government to engage in retroactive adjudication that affect substantive right but expect that it would be a rare thing that that would happen and that most of these kind of action would happen through rulemaking this of course be the court s the government s claim the power to affect every medicare provider in the country retroactively through these seriatim adjudication why be why be this extraordinary ,303.96,Case pending,"Jan 15, 2019","Alex M.

2018,Garza v. Idaho,115,Neil Gorsuch,"Counsel -- No, please, go ahead. Counsel -- if I might. Thank you. One quick question. You rely a lot on the autonomy of the client, and we certainly have a lot of cases saying, you know, a decision whether to appeal or make a major decision like that belong to the client. Here, though, we have a complicating factor that the autonomy's already been expressed through the plea waiver and it's presumptively correct given that it's a final judgment of a trial court at that moment at least. What do we do about that? So autonomy runs both ways here in this particular instance, and presumed prejudice in this circumstance, is there some tension between that and the fact that we don't presume prejudice even when lawyers make really bad, obviously wrong strategic, tactical decisions in cases all the time? How do we reconcile that where even -- even in obvious circumstances we don't presume prejudice? And, here, most of these cases are going to be non-prejudicial, right? So what do we do about those problems? But looking at it as a whole, we've -- it's complicated. It's muddled, right? Time 1 and time 2 are complicated. Yeah. Yeah. But doesn't that run counter to our normal division of labor between clients and lawyers? Don't clients generally specify the end, I wish to appeal, and leave it to the lawyer to determine the means? And doesn't it become incumbent at that stage upon the lawyer to identify whether there are any viable issues for appeal and come back to the client and say there are some or there are not some? And a failure to do that, why isn't the failure to do that presumptively prejudicial? But why doesn't that answer the question here? Because -- -- there's undoubtedly a statutory right to appeal. And the waiver is only good if it's asserted. And often the government fails to assert it in a timely fashion in the courts of appeals, and the courts of appeals just disregard the waiver all together. It is in the nature of an affirmative defense that you'd lose if you don't use. So why isn't it the denial in a proceeding to which the defendant is entitled by law? Because he has no legal right to that kind of appeal? But he does have a legal right to appeal to the court -- relevant court of appeals. That is a statutory right. Now perhaps Congress could change that and say in appeal waivers cases, you know, I'm sure the government can go seek that, but for now at least, there's a statutory right to appeal to the right court. So back to Justice Breyer's question, I think we've -- -- removed that complication you've added. Again, I think that's just evading the hypothetical, respectfully, counsel. And there may be no legal right in those instances. I'm talking about a case where it's the right court and the right period of time and there is a statutory right. I think that's what Justice Breyer is trying to aim at. And maybe you could too. How does that fit with the usual breakdown of responsibilities between client and lawyer where we normally assume that clients only specify objectives or ends and that the lawyer has the obligation under our ethical rules and, mostly -- most of our Sixth Amendment jurisprudence to -- to pick the appropriate means? So, if a client says I wish to appeal anything that's possible, why isn't that a necessary directive to the lawyer to figure out which possible things fall outside the waiver or -- or those sorts of things? Why does a client have to come forward and identify the winning argument? ",counsel no please go ahead counsel if i might thank you one quick question you rely a lot on the autonomy of the client and we certainly have a lot of case say you know a decision whether to appeal or make a major decision like that belong to the client here though we have a complicating factor that the autonomy s already be express through the plea waiver and it be presumptively correct give that it be a final judgment of a trial court at that moment at least what do we do about that so autonomy run both way here in this particular instance and presumed prejudice in this circumstance be there some tension between that and the fact that we do not presume prejudice even when lawyer make really bad obviously wrong strategic tactical decision in case all the time how do we reconcile that where even even in obvious circumstance we do not presume prejudice and here most of these case be go to be non prejudicial right so what do we do about those problem but look at it as a whole we have it be complicate it be muddle right time and time be complicate yeah yeah but do not that run counter to our normal division of labor between client and lawyer do not client generally specify the end i wish to appeal and leave it to the lawyer to determine the mean and do not it become incumbent at that stage upon the lawyer to identify whether there be any viable issue for appeal and come back to the client and say there be some or there be not some and a failure to do that why be not the failure to do that presumptively prejudicial but why do not that answer the question here because there be undoubtedly a statutory right to appeal and the waiver be only good if it be assert and often the government fail to assert it in a timely fashion in the court of appeal and the court of appeal just disregard the waiver all together it be in the nature of an affirmative defense that you would lose if you do not use so why be not it the denial in a proceeding to which the defendant be entitle by law because he have no legal right to that kind of appeal but he do have a legal right to appeal to the court relevant court of appeal that be a statutory right now perhaps congress could change that and say in appeal waiver case you know I be sure the government can go seek that but for now at least there be a statutory right to appeal to the right court so back to justice breyer s question i think we have remove that complication you have add again i think that be just evade the hypothetical respectfully counsel and there may be no legal right in those instance I be talk about a case where it be the right court and the right period of time and there be a statutory right i think that be what justice breyer be try to aim at and maybe you could too how do that fit with the usual breakdown of responsibility between client and lawyer where we normally assume that client only specify objective or end and that the lawyer have the obligation under our ethical rule and mostly most of our sixth amendment jurisprudence to to pick the appropriate mean so if a client say i wish to appeal anything that be possible why be not that a necessary directive to the lawyer to figure out which possible thing fall outside the waiver or or those sort of thing why do a client have to come forward and identify the win argument ,198.76,Roberts Court,"Oct 30, 2018","Gilberto Garza, Jr.",Idaho,17-1026,"Jun 18, 2018","Feb 27, 2019",115.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2018,"Return Mail, Inc. v. United States Postal Service",115,Neil Gorsuch,"Well, counsel, the argument on the other side I know we're going to hear is Section 207 allows the government to participate in a lot of aspects of the patent system affirmatively, and given that, it would be natural to extend it to IPR review as well. Do you care to respond to that argument? Ms. Brinkmann -- But, Ms. Brinkmann, I guess the question I'm struggling with, and I -- I think some of my colleagues are as well, is one could understand why a rational Congress wouldn't want the government to go before its own agency to kill private party patents. I can understand that argument. What's less clear to me is why a rational Congress would allow ex parte review initiated by the government before a governmental agency, that kind of a situation, but not allow a more robust adversarial process involving the government as a party? So what's the -- what's the rational line that one could draw between those two arrangements? I -- I think that's where I'm struggling. Well, but -- -- but, Mr. Stewart, there we have the express language of 207 that does that work. And, here, you're asking us to imply it. And I think Justice Sotomayor raises a really important question. Normally, we -- we think of the executive branch as able to resolve its own disputes and speak with one voice. And as Justice Kavanaugh alluded to with ex parte communication -- ex parte review, you have the final word of the PTO director as the final word of the executive branch on the status of a patent. And, here, the scenario would be that the government speaks out of both sides of its mouth potentially. The PTO director resolving a case against, say, the Postal Service and coming to Court for us to resolve that dispute about the executive department's view of the law, that's unusual. Not to say unprecedented, but unusual. And shouldn't we, as Justice Sotomayor suggested, at least expect some sort of clarity from Congress when it wants that unusual arrangement to reign? If you could get to my question, Mr. Stewart. We acknowledge in 207 -- nobody's here disputing that the executive can come before the PTAB -- before the PTO to -- to secure a patent. That's in the language of 207. Mr. Stewart, I hate to interrupt you, but I -- I'd really like an answer to the -- it's the same question I asked and Justice Kavanaugh asked, and perhaps you could get to it. Isn't that flipping the presumption? I mean, the presumption is that ""person"" doesn't include the government, and you're suggesting, well, because ""person"" is broad and it's a big term, it includes the government. So -- -- Mr. Stewart, does it -- does the estoppel point become just even a little odder still when we consider that, in the IPR proceedings, it's the government that would be the plaintiff, as it were, seeking to cancel a patent before the government as judge, so both prosecutor and judge in these proceedings, and then not be bound by its own findings brought in a case by its own prosecutor, effectively, later in a Court of Claims proceeding? So I understand the government's often not bound by estoppel, but it's usually in the role of a defendant in those circumstances, and certainly not before its own tribunal. Isn't it a little unseemly to say that the executive branch shouldn't be bound by its own decisions? I understand that. We all -- we understand that. That wasn't the question. ",well counsel the argument on the other side i know we be go to hear be section allow the government to participate in a lot of aspect of the patent system affirmatively and give that it would be natural to extend it to ipr review as well do you care to respond to that argument ms brinkmann but ms brinkmann i guess the question I be struggle with and i i think some of my colleague be as well be one could understand why a rational congress would not want the government to go before its own agency to kill private party patent i can understand that argument what be less clear to me be why a rational congress would allow ex parte review initiate by the government before a governmental agency that kind of a situation but not allow a more robust adversarial process involve the government as a party so what be the what be the rational line that one could draw between those two arrangement i i think that be where I be struggle well but but mr stewart there we have the express language of that do that work and here you be ask us to imply it and i think justice sotomayor raise a really important question normally we we think of the executive branch as able to resolve its own dispute and speak with one voice and as justice kavanaugh allude to with ex parte communication ex parte review you have the final word of the pto director as the final word of the executive branch on the status of a patent and here the scenario would be that the government speak out of both side of its mouth potentially the pto director resolve a case against say the postal service and come to court for us to resolve that dispute about the executive department s view of the law that be unusual not to say unprecedented but unusual and should not we as justice sotomayor suggest at least expect some sort of clarity from congress when it want that unusual arrangement to reign if you could get to my question mr stewart we acknowledge in nobody s here dispute that the executive can come before the ptab before the pto to to secure a patent that be in the language of mr stewart i hate to interrupt you but i I would really like an answer to the it be the same question i ask and justice kavanaugh ask and perhaps you could get to it be not that flip the presumption i mean the presumption be that person do not include the government and you be suggest well because person be broad and it be a big term it include the government so mr stewart do it do the estoppel point become just even a little odder still when we consider that in the ipr proceeding it be the government that would be the plaintiff as it we be seek to cancel a patent before the government as judge so both prosecutor and judge in these proceeding and then not be bind by its own finding bring in a case by its own prosecutor effectively later in a court of claim proceed so i understand the government s often not bind by estoppel but it be usually in the role of a defendant in those circumstance and certainly not before its own tribunal be not it a little unseemly to say that the executive branch should not be bind by its own decision i understand that we all we understand that that be not the question ,200.36,Case pending,"Feb 19, 2019","Return Mail, Inc.",United States Postal Service,17-1594,"Oct 26, 2018",,115.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

And for that, we need the last sentence, right? All right. I'm following you so far, great.

Why isn't that just conceding away the case? If the repo man is not collecting a debt, he's just executing a security interest, why is that really problematic for you, Mr. Geyser? I'm just talking about the repo man. Just the repo man. First of all, first question, why doesn't he fall within the first sentence of -- of a? And -- and, second, if -- if he doesn't, then why isn't he exactly like the foreclosure expert? Can I see if I under -- I'm sorry. I just want to make sure I understand the answer. The -- the statute uses the language primary purpose debt collection, primary purpose security interest, sentences 1 and 3. Are you saying that the test of a bank's primary purpose is whether it's taking an action necessary under state law to collect on a security interest or to enforce a security interest? Right. But -- but -- but, in that third sentence, it also uses that language, primary purpose. Is your answer that we determine that by reference to state law and what is mandated in order to collect on a security interest or to enforce a security interest? All right. I understand. Thank you. I'm sorry for interrupting. ",mr geyser can i i may be miss something here so i I would appreciate your help as i understand it you you think that first sentence in a be the main one and capture most debt collector but for some reason it do not capture the the repo man who in the dead of night go and just grab my car and for that we need the last sentence right all right I be follow you so far great but then when i go over to f which far illuminate that last sentence and and talk about who be cover it talk about the fellow who take now the dead of night repo man you be talk about or threaten to take a security interest so there be that fellow he be not just take the stuff in the middle of the night he be he be threaten to do it he be talk to me and i would have think that fellow would have be capture by your reading of the first sentence of of a so that be rather convolute and roundabout but help me out why why do not that disprove your your thesis many elegant word there but what do we do about the word threaten that be my question well threaten to take a non judicial action to with respect to a security interest that be what the statute say so so help me out with that language that be where i need your i know you have get something for me here i have another question about your repo man example you say we need that last sentence to capture him in a but why would not he be capture by the first sentence in a too why be not a repo man a classic debt collector under any definition even the broad the very broad one you proffer for a first sentence the principal purpose of his business use interstate commerce to collect a debt whatever whatever the first sentence say why why do not you lose then why be not that just concede away the case if the repo man be not collect a debt he be just execute a security interest why be that really problematic for you mr geyser I be just talk about the repo man just the repo man first of all first question why do not he fall within the first sentence of of a and and second if if he do not then why be not he exactly like the foreclosure expert can i see if i under I be sorry i just want to make sure i understand the answer the the statute use the language primary purpose debt collection primary purpose security interest sentence and be you say that the test of a bank s primary purpose be whether it be take an action necessary under state law to collect on a security interest or to enforce a security interest right but but but in that third sentence it also use that language primary purpose be your answer that we determine that by reference to state law and what be mandate in order to collect on a security interest or to enforce a security interest all right i understand thank you I be sorry for interrupt ,162.28,Case pending,"Jan 7, 2019",Dennis Obduskey,"McCarthy & Holthus LLP, et al.",17-1307,"Jun 28, 2018",,115.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2018,BNSF Railway Company v. Loos,115,Neil Gorsuch,"Well, counsel, when I think of wages for services performed -- and maybe it's too simplistic -- but I -- We'll see. I -- I -- I think of it as the compensation that an -- an employer voluntarily gives the employee. So not just the hourly wage, but the sick time, the vacation time might be included as part of the package. For the services when you are present, I include that payment. I think of a judgment of a court for negligence get -- awarded involuntarily against the employer's consent as something very different. What's wrong with that? Go ahead. Well, but, see, that's not services rendered, is it? It's payment for a judgment of a court. I -- I get that there's a tough line-drawing problem here, and I have some questions for the other side on that, but if you just in isolation deal with the FELA judgment compared with, say, sick and vacation time. What about -- That's where I get stuck too. I've got some questions about that for your friend on the other side. What's your other one? I would be curious, your answer to Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kagan's questions earlier. So what do we do about a general verdict where there's no allocation between what might be later thought by some to be compensation for lost services and other -- other things? What do we do about pain and suffering, which might be classified as compensation for lost time as well? What's the government's view on those complications? I was -- I was going to ask you if you'd volunteer. No, I follow all of that. And your Footnote 9 was excellent in explaining that. But my question still remains, if a judgment of an administrative agency in a state setting, in an admittedly intra-state accident is, you would concede, I believe, compensation for wages, then why -- why wouldn't a federal inter-state FELA judgment? Well, what do we do -- you say that there's no basis for a jury instruction to gross-up, but it -- it sounds like there's for a long time been a jury instruction requiring the jury to -- to net-down. Isn't what's good for the goose good for the gander on this? What -- what do you say to Mr. Frederick's point that the reason why the railroad's so interested in this is to increase its leverage in settlement negotiations, where the parties can allocate awards, and -- and here you're arguing pretty strenuously that they shouldn't be able to -- to -- to -- to be -- to take into cognizance the tax issue on -- in -- in a jury judgment?

2018,Thacker v. Tennessee Valley Authority,115,Neil Gorsuch,"Well, but, Ms. Adams, on that, I was stuck where the Chief was on -- on your brief. And are you arguing -- I -- I don't take you to be arguing, but I'm not sure -- that Congress is unable to waive sovereign immunity? So Congress could waive even the executive's immunity on discretionary functions? I mean, it would be perfectly sensible if Congress wanted to create, say, a cola company because it thought there wasn't sufficient competition in the soft drink industry, a true commercial entity, that it would allow suit for negligence and those -- against such an entity so that it has to internalize its costs of operation and compete on equal footing with other private commercial entities. That would be perfectly appropriate in the government's view I -- I take it? Okay. So why isn't it a strike against your interpretation that you -- you would interpret the discretionary-function so broad as to not just encompass classic governmental decisions but really pretty ministerial commercial activity by the TVA, like raising a power line? But -- but the government's not -- the government would defend the judgment in this case. Okay. Yeah. Shouldn't -- shouldn't we expect a little more clarity from Congress than that? If -- if the government wishes to compete in private industry and the commercial world, shouldn't we expect the government to make it clear that it wishes to retain its immunity a little bit more clearly than enacting a statute that says the entity may be sued? I mean, those are the only words we have in the statute. You're asking us to embroider them quite a bit, aren't you? I'm not interested in that, as you know, Ms. Adams. Talk to me about the words. Right. But I'm -- I'm -- I'm going to try and pin you down just a little bit. Let's assume you've lost that argument. Okay? I -- I -- I -- I know. Is -- is -- is that Burr is just a categorical question, preliminary question, as to whether the discretionary-function exception applies. You've lost that. Okay? Just a hypothesis. Does the government have any backup argument at all, or is that the end of it? And I'd -- and I'd really appreciate, if it's possible, to start with a yes or a no. Oh, sure, land -- federal lands, absolutely, but if -- if -- if -- if the government were setting up a cola company, why should we, with this very limited language before us, which actually seems to go the other way -- should we require Congress, if it wishes to assert sovereign immunity in cases of classic commercial conduct, like my cola company, to say so a little more clearly than this? This, after all, being go ahead and sue us. Well, no, that would be grounded in political policy, sure, but that's my whole point of my hypothetical. Congress decided that it needed another cola company in the world, we needed one for some reason, we needed another cola company in the world. So there's a political decision there, clearly, when Congress acts to create a commercial entity. So I don't think that would solve our problem. We'd need something else, wouldn't we? Now you're just fighting the hypothetical. I understand you disagree with the hypothetical. But, in that hypothetical, shouldn't we ask Congress to be a little clearer if it wants to provide immunity and allow -- I mean, actually, what we're talking about is allowing a commercial entity to externalize its costs, to the victims of its negligence, have to bear the cost, rather than internalize the cost like every other commercial operator has to bear its costs of negligence. That's quite an extraordinary thing you're asking for, isn't it? ",well but ms adam on that i be stick where the chief be on on your brief and be you argue i i do not take you to be argue but I be not sure that congress be unable to waive sovereign immunity so congress could waive even the executive s immunity on discretionary function i mean it would be perfectly sensible if congress want to create say a cola company because it think there be not sufficient competition in the soft drink industry a true commercial entity that it would allow suit for negligence and those against such an entity so that it have to internalize its cost of operation and compete on equal footing with other private commercial entity that would be perfectly appropriate in the government s view i i take it okay so why be not it a strike against your interpretation that you you would interpret the discretionary function so broad as to not just encompass classic governmental decision but really pretty ministerial commercial activity by the tva like raise a power line but but the government s not the government would defend the judgment in this case okay yeah should not should not we expect a little more clarity from congress than that if if the government wish to compete in private industry and the commercial world should not we expect the government to make it clear that it wish to retain its immunity a little bit more clearly than enact a statute that say the entity may be sue i mean those be the only word we have in the statute you be ask us to embroider them quite a bit be not you I be not interested in that as you know ms adam talk to me about the word right but I be I be I be go to try and pin you down just a little bit let us assume you have lose that argument okay i i i i know be be be that burr be just a categorical question preliminary question as to whether the discretionary function exception applies you have lose that okay just a hypothesis do the government have any backup argument at all or be that the end of it and I have and I would really appreciate if it be possible to start with a yes or a no oh sure land federal land absolutely but if if if if the government we be set up a cola company why should we with this very limited language before us which actually seem to go the other way should we require congress if it wish to assert sovereign immunity in case of classic commercial conduct like my cola company to say so a little more clearly than this this after all be go ahead and sue us well no that would be ground in political policy sure but that be my whole point of my hypothetical congress decide that it need another cola company in the world we need one for some reason we need another cola company in the world so there be a political decision there clearly when congress act to create a commercial entity so i do not think that would solve our problem we would need something else would not we now you be just fight the hypothetical i understand you disagree with the hypothetical but in that hypothetical should not we ask congress to be a little clearer if it want to provide immunity and allow i mean actually what we be talk about be allow a commercial entity to externalize its cost to the victim of its negligence have to bear the cost rather than internalize the cost like every other commercial operator have to bear its cost of negligence that be quite an extraordinary thing you be ask for be not it ,203.72,Case pending,"Jan 14, 2019","Gary Thacker, et ux.",Tennessee Valley Authority,17-1201,"Sep 27, 2018",,115.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

2018,Lorenzo v. Securities and Exchange Commission,115,Neil Gorsuch,"Counsel, that's not how I understand the argument. And as I understand the argument, it goes something like this, and it proceeds in about five or six steps, I think. First, Central Bank says we've got to look at the statute. The rule is nice, but let's look at the statute. So we look at the statute, and it prohibits manipulative or deceptive devices essentially. Well, no manipulation is alleged here, just deception. Are we on the same page so far? Well, if I -- if I -- I'm just talking about 10(b) -- 10(b) at the moment. We can get to 17 in a minute. All right. But -- so we're -- so we're on the same page. And when we talk about deception or fraud, we have mens rea and actus reus. You say I'm not contesting mens rea, just actus reus. Okay, fine. When we get to actus reus, no omission is alleged, just an action. You could -- you could have an actus reus of fraud by act or omission, only act's charged here. And the only act seems to be this statement issued to potential investors, and we have a finding from the D.C. Circuit that it wasn't made, that act wasn't made, that statement wasn't made by this defendant. Now we could maybe overturn that, I suppose, and you could argue that. But, if you didn't make the act a fraud that's alleged, then doesn't that necessarily imply he substantially assisted if anything? I think that's the argument. But the only act of fraud, you have to have an act that deceives someone else. And the only thing that deceived anybody allegedly here were these emails, right? And he didn't -- and he didn't make them. Well, are -- are you challenging that? I understood the government to say we're not challenging the D.C. Circuit's holding that he didn't make the statements. Okay. The actus -- I think where we're getting stuck, and then I'll -- I'll stop, I promise, is that the actus reus for fraud is the act of actually deceiving another person. And the only thing that could have done that here would have been the transmission of the emails to other persons, right? Okay. We agree -- we agree on that. Okay. But the act -- the relevant act for fraud, again, though, is the act of deceiving another. Well, counsel -- -- I think what I'm -- what I heard at any rate -- and we can -- it's an interesting question what the argument is, but I had understood it that, all right, one can create a false impression in the mind of another through conduct or through statements. All right? Here, the only thing that was alleged to create a false impression in the mind of others was this statement and that that's the problem you have. If the only false act, the only actus reus, was a statement and he didn't make it, then what? He sure helped. I mean, there's no doubt about it. He did a lot to help. But he didn't engage in any independent conduct that created a false impression in the mind of the other, other than disseminate the false statement that did that. Oh, for sure. Oh, for sure. And -- and you -- you've -- you've penalized him heavily and are going to be able to on anybody's account, but we're trying to draw a line here between primary and secondary. And that's -- that's where I'm stuck. We're not worried about just this case, are we, counsel? You've made the point, but you -- you concede we've got bigger fish to fry than that, right? You've got lots of mens rea, I grant you. Okay? And -- but -- Oh, those are acts. They are indeed acts. But, if the act that created the deception in the mind of another wasn't any conduct, it was a statement, then what, is the question? It helped the deception, but the deceptive -- the thing that caused the deception in the mind of the other, to get back to Justice Breyer's quotation from Black's, was the statement in the email, the -- the erroneous facts transmitted to investors in the email, right? That's it? There's not -- ",counsel that be not how i understand the argument and as i understand the argument it go something like this and it proceed in about five or six step i think first central bank say we have get to look at the statute the rule be nice but let us look at the statute so we look at the statute and it prohibit manipulative or deceptive device essentially well no manipulation be allege here just deception be we on the same page so far well if i if i I be just talk about b b at the moment we can get to in a minute all right but so we be so we be on the same page and when we talk about deception or fraud we have mens rea and actus reus you say I be not contest men rea just actus reus okay fine when we get to actus reus no omission be allege just an action you could you could have an actus reus of fraud by act or omission only act s charge here and the only act seem to be this statement issue to potential investor and we have a finding from the dc circuit that it be not make that act be not make that statement be not make by this defendant now we could maybe overturn that i suppose and you could argue that but if you do not make the act a fraud that be allege then do not that necessarily imply he substantially assist if anything i think that be the argument but the only act of fraud you have to have an act that deceive someone else and the only thing that deceive anybody allegedly here we be these email right and he do not and he do not make them well be be you challenge that i understand the government to say we be not challenge the dc circuit s holding that he do not make the statement okay the actus i think where we be get stick and then I will I will stop i promise be that the actus reus for fraud be the act of actually deceive another person and the only thing that could have do that here would have be the transmission of the email to other person right okay we agree we agree on that okay but the act the relevant act for fraud again though be the act of deceive another well counsel i think what I be what i hear at any rate and we can it be an interesting question what the argument be but i have understand it that all right one can create a false impression in the mind of another through conduct or through statement all right here the only thing that be allege to create a false impression in the mind of others be this statement and that that be the problem you have if the only false act the only actus reus be a statement and he do not make it then what he sure help i mean there be no doubt about it he do a lot to help but he do not engage in any independent conduct that create a false impression in the mind of the other other than disseminate the false statement that do that oh for sure oh for sure and and you you have you have penalize him heavily and be go to be able to on anybody s account but we be try to draw a line here between primary and secondary and that be that be where I be stick we be not worry about just this case be we counsel you have make the point but you you concede we have get big fish to fry than that right you have get lot of men rea i grant you okay and but oh those be act they be indeed act but if the act that create the deception in the mind of another be not any conduct it be a statement then what be the question it help the deception but the deceptive the thing that cause the deception in the mind of the other to get back to justice breyer s quotation from black s be the statement in the email the the erroneous fact transmit to investor in the email right that be it there be not ,218.56000000000003,Case pending,"Dec 3, 2018",Francis V.

2018,Herrera v. Wyoming,115,Neil Gorsuch,"But -- Counsel -- counsel, I'll spot you that. I mean, it's a little curious that -- now I don't wish to fault my old court, but the Tenth Circuit decided that the land was occupied by the federal government as an alternative holding without hearing from the federal government, who now disclaims the idea that they occupied the territory. So I -- I -- I take your point. But do we have to get into any of this issue preclusion stuff at all? If this issue wasn't raised by the district, passed on by the district court, relied on by the district court, in this proceeding, why should we enmesh ourselves in the excellent Wyoming law of issue preclusion? Let's do that then. Tell us about that. What do you say to the suggestion that we just be done with Race Horse and overrule it? Counsel, along those lines, you asked for remand for an evidentiary exploration of whether the land here was occupied. At the same time, though, you -- you point out that the district court didn't rely on the occupation as a basis for its relying on the Tenth Circuit opinion. Seems there's some tension there to me. Maybe not. Maybe you can help me out why there isn't. Why should we allow a remand for that? You know, it's a new argument raised in this Court for the first time. Why should we address it at all? So, fine, we -- we could remand it back, but do we need to say anything about this at all? All right. I've got one more question for you then. That helps. The government says that the state retains some conservation easement here. That -- I don't know where it comes from, but you -- you tell us that such a thing exists. At the same time, though, the treaty says that -- that the tribe is allowed to hunt on the land until the game are gone -- -- which seems to suggest that the white man can eliminate all the game. But now you say the Indian cannot. How can that be? I don't understand that, if the treaty were silent about the game. But the treaty is express, and it contemplates no conservation. It contemplates the complete elimination of the game by the white man. So, if the white man gets to eliminate the game, again, counsel for the government, how come the Indian may not? We don't need to address that. Can I -- can we just -- Oh, I'm sorry. Counsel, can we return to -- -- an area where we might at least be able to nail down some agreement between the parties? And that is your argument rests largely on issue preclusion. And you made an impassioned defense of Race Horse and an excellent one, but what -- what kind of change in law is sufficient to render issue preclusion inapplicable? Is it a substantial change in the law? Is that the test you'd have this Court use? Is it a change in the law? Would you require a formal overruling in so many words? What is -- what is the State's understanding of the appropriate test? Well, you are the one who's invoked it, though. I mean, you invoked issue preclusion, all right, as the primary argument in your -- in your briefs. So I think you owe us an explanation -- -- what standard you'd have us apply. Okay. That's the test, major doctrinal shift? Thank you. I don't -- I don't follow that, because if -- if we were to adopt that -- approve of the conservation principle that the government urges and the American Congress does too, you would have your game wardens out and about ensuring that people are not hunting during off-season, for example. And if they're allowed to go on the forest land by agreement with the United States, why then how would there be any ambiguity about their capacity to issue citations? I'm just not clear about how litigation would be required to resolve that. Well, that's a problem you have without respect to this case, right? I mean, either the government allows you to do that or it doesn't allow you to do that. And that has nothing to do with anything before us, right? Right. So, okay, so we can put that one aside. So, again, what ambiguity remains in -- in response to Justice Kavanaugh's question? ",but counsel counsel I will spot you that i mean it be a little curious that now i do not wish to fault my old court but the tenth circuit decide that the land be occupy by the federal government as an alternative holding without hear from the federal government who now disclaim the idea that they occupy the territory so i i i take your point but do we have to get into any of this issue preclusion stuff at all if this issue be not raise by the district pass on by the district court rely on by the district court in this proceeding why should we enmesh ourselves in the excellent wyoming law of issue preclusion let us do that then tell us about that what do you say to the suggestion that we just be do with race horse and overrule it counsel along those line you ask for remand for an evidentiary exploration of whether the land here be occupy at the same time though you you point out that the district court do not rely on the occupation as a basis for its relying on the tenth circuit opinion seem there be some tension there to me maybe not maybe you can help me out why there be not why should we allow a remand for that you know it be a new argument raise in this court for the first time why should we address it at all so fine we we could remand it back but do we need to say anything about this at all all right I have get one more question for you then that help the government say that the state retain some conservation easement here that i do not know where it come from but you you tell us that such a thing exist at the same time though the treaty say that that the tribe be allow to hunt on the land until the game be go which seem to suggest that the white man can eliminate all the game but now you say the indian can not how can that be i do not understand that if the treaty we be silent about the game but the treaty be express and it contemplate no conservation it contemplate the complete elimination of the game by the white man so if the white man get to eliminate the game again counsel for the government how come the indian may not we do not need to address that can i can we just oh I be sorry counsel can we return to an area where we might at least be able to nail down some agreement between the party and that be your argument rest largely on issue preclusion and you make an impassioned defense of race horse and an excellent one but what what kind of change in law be sufficient to render issue preclusion inapplicable be it a substantial change in the law be that the test you would have this court use be it a change in the law would you require a formal overruling in so many word what be what be the state s understanding of the appropriate test well you be the one who be invoke it though i mean you invoke issue preclusion all right as the primary argument in your in your brief so i think you owe us an explanation what standard you would have us apply okay that be the test major doctrinal shift thank you i do not i do not follow that because if if we we be to adopt that approve of the conservation principle that the government urge and the american congress do too you would have your game wardens out and about ensure that people be not hunt during off season for example and if they be allow to go on the forest land by agreement with the united state why then how would there be any ambiguity about their capacity to issue citation I be just not clear about how litigation would be require to resolve that well that be a problem you have without respect to this case right i mean either the government allow you to do that or it do not allow you to do that and that have nothing to do with anything before us right right so okay so we can put that one aside so again what ambiguity remain in in response to justice kavanaugh s question ,241.84,Case pending,"Jan 8, 2019",Clayvin Herrera,Wyoming,17-532,"Jun 28, 2018",,115.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2018,Air and Liquid Systems Corp. v. Devries,115,Neil Gorsuch,"Besides -- besides the costs of having an additional warning, do you see any other downsides to expanding the scope of the duty to warn in this way? I'm really not interested in asbestos and bare metal. I'm talking, as Justice Kagan was, as a matter of doctrine and policy. What costs, what downsides are there associated with expanding the duty to warn, at least insofar as we're talking about things that are directed or necessary or inevitably used? Forget about foreseeability for a moment. We -- we normally do, you're right, put the duty to warn with the lowest-cost avoider. But sometimes it's expanded and, in some cases, it has been expanded in this area, it looks like, and I'm just wondering what -- what are the negatives associated with that? Why is that bad? No, that incentive remains. I mean, that still -- we're expanding the duty to warn. We're not contracting it. Okay? So that doesn't work. Well, Mr. Goldstein, that's where I guess I'm having trouble figuring out where the line is. The Third Circuit, as I read it, adopted a foreseeability analysis, which is quite generous. And it could be that 10 percent possibility. Well, at the end of the question you may do with it what you wish. (Laughter.) You can answer it. You can choose not to answer it. We've seen plenty of that on this bench. You can choose to answer another question. Entirely up to you. (Laughter.) But a foreseeability analysis might be a 10 or a 30 percent, we can quibble, okay, but some chance. Then there is in the case law a suggestion of inevitability, okay, certitude, we know it's going to be used. And then there is the third possible rule, which seems to be the traditional products liability rule, which is you warn for your own thing and not for someone else's, okay? Those are the three choices between us. And I think we've been aligning the first two a little bit here in this discussion. And I'm just curious, which is it that you are asking this Court to adopt? And why? Right. I'm not talking about the replacement parts portion of the opinion right now. I'm just talking about the bare-metal portion of the opinion. Put aside the replacement parts. I think we're -- we have three possibilities before us. And you're still -- you're saying the second one is the one you'd have us adopt? Well, I guess I'm confused then, because I -- I haven't used a flashlight without a battery very often. I mean, you know, it seems inevitable. The other example that we're given is the manufacturer of the ashtray -- -- who inevitably knows that it's going to be used with some sort of tobacco product, hopefully. And extending the duty to warn in those cases, some of the concerns that your colleague has raised about over-warnings, contradictory warnings, and the costs associated with that, that might deter innovation and raise consumer cost needlessly, seem to have some purchase to me. So help me out. I'm -- I'm stuck where Justice Kagan is. What if -- what if -- let's just take a hypothetical. Okay. The -- the ashtray, a jury will find in my hypothetical case that the particular nature of its design meant that the manufacturer knew it would be used with tobacco products inevitably, okay? Then what? Well, just stick with the -- the hypothetical. All right. All right. I know there are defenses, and there are going to be defenses -- -- for General Electric or whomever in this case too. I -- I'm not asking about that. Is there a duty, is what I'm asking, okay? That -- that you could get to a jury on duty? That's my question.

2018,Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. v. Albrecht,115,Neil Gorsuch,"Counsel -- I'm sorry. I think the question that we're all kind of struggling with here seems to me to be this, or something along these lines: Reading the statute your way, do we create a moral hazard that encourages manufacturers to supply the FDA with a lot of information, overwhelming with data, but maybe not the most artfully drafted and maybe deliberately inartfully drafted warning that it thinks is reasonably calculated to be refused, so that it can avoid having to shoulder or bear its own costs of -- of -- internalize its own costs of negligence. What -- what -- what comfort can you give the Court that that's not the -- the outcome of the statutory regime reading that you're proposing? What do we do about the fact that under the regulations Merck could have filed a CBE at any time? Does that pose a problem for you, at least after, say, the -- the March investigation starts? Perhaps I'll spot you that with respect to -- for purposes of this question before the March 2010 letter, but what about after that? Once it starts launching an investigation into the product, the task force period, what do we do about that period? Well, Mr. Frederick, let -- let's say I buy at least part of what you're selling, for purposes of this question, that the complete response letter and, what is it, 355(o)(4) -- -- doesn't -- thank you -- doesn't completely answer our question. We have, though, the March 2010 safety statement from the FDA which pretty clearly says that they do not think that there is science enough to support a causal link between the drug and atypical femoral fractures. So whatever was missing in the complete response letter from the FDA seems to come in March of 2010. Why shouldn't we read the complete response letter in light of the March 2010 safety -- Well, you and I will not dispute the elegance of Justice Thomas's opinion in Wyeth. (Laughter.) But I'm not sure that helps me very much. (Laughter.) And -- and in all seriousness, if -- if there's some ambiguity about the warning letter, about the complete response letter, isn't that resolved by the FDA's own statement against interest, perhaps, months later, why doesn't that tell us exactly what it was up to? Well, and that's why it set up the task force at the same time to go study the issue, and it said up to that point we don't have enough, but we're going to go study it. And so why isn't that -- tell us everything we need to know about what its complete response letter was about, as a matter of law?

2018,New Prime Inc. v. Oliveira,115,Neil Gorsuch,"Well, what do we do about the fact that, less haphazardly, your -- your colleague on the other side has documented that back in 1925, which is when the statute was enacted, and I think you'd agree that we have to interpret it as a reasonable reader would have at that time, didn't necessarily distinguish between independent contractors and employees with the degree of care that the law has subsequently come to use. And maybe even that your own client doesn't use. According to its website, it speaks of employing, I believe -- I can't remember the exact variation of the word -- but it treats these independent contractors as employing them. So what do we -- what do we do about the fact that that is at least an available reading still today and that there's a lot of historical evidence at the time of the statute in question that ""contract of employment"" may have swept more broadly? Mr. Boutrous, you -- you moved nicely to the merits, but just so we haven't ignored where we've moved so quickly in response to Justice Ginsburg's question, and I share the same concern, so perhaps you can help me. Before a court can do anything, issue an order under Section 4 compelling arbitration, that's what you want, is an order from the district court compelling arbitration, I would have thought it would have had to satisfy itself that it had the power to issue such an order. And Section 1 has this carve-out. And why isn't it more like a challenge to the delegation provision itself if you want to use Rent-A-Center as your authority, as I believe you do, rather than a challenge to the underlying contract? If we're going to make an analogy, I would have thought the analogy would have worked the other way. Help me. Well, while we have you here, you -- you -- in response to Justice Alito and Justice Kagan, you raised a very interesting point about the difference between workers and companies. And similar to the kind of question we have here presented between employees and independent contractors, there are going to be fact issues in either circumstance where a district court's going to have to sort them out. Courts disagree over how summary those procedures should be. Let's say we're just in -- in a world of workers versus companies. How would you expect the district court to sort that out? I mean, the FAA is supposed to resolve these things quickly in a summary fashion. Section 4 says if there's a dispute over whether there is a contract to arbitrate, it's supposed to go to a summary trial, not five years of discovery and all the glories that entails that we're familiar -- all painfully familiar with these days. But how -- how would you advise us to write that portion of the opinion? So is it safe to say that we have at least common ground on one thing, maybe a few things today, but at least on this, that the proceedings may not be limited to the form of the document before us but should be summary in nature? ",well what do we do about the fact that less haphazardly your your colleague on the other side have document that back in which be when the statute be enact and i think you would agree that we have to interpret it as a reasonable reader would have at that time do not necessarily distinguish between independent contractor and employee with the degree of care that the law have subsequently come to use and maybe even that your own client do not use accord to its website it speak of employ i believe i can not remember the exact variation of the word but it treat these independent contractor as employ them so what do we what do we do about the fact that that be at least an available reading still today and that there be a lot of historical evidence at the time of the statute in question that contract of employment may have sweep more broadly mr boutrous you you move nicely to the merit but just so we have not ignore where we have move so quickly in response to justice ginsburg s question and i share the same concern so perhaps you can help me before a court can do anything issue an order under section compelling arbitration that be what you want be an order from the district court compel arbitration i would have think it would have have to satisfy itself that it have the power to issue such an order and section have this carve out and why be not it more like a challenge to the delegation provision itself if you want to use rent a center as your authority as i believe you do rather than a challenge to the underlie contract if we be go to make an analogy i would have think the analogy would have work the other way help me well while we have you here you you in response to justice alito and justice kagan you raise a very interesting point about the difference between worker and company and similar to the kind of question we have here present between employee and independent contractor there be go to be fact issue in either circumstance where a district court s go to have to sort them out court disagree over how summary those procedure should be let us say we be just in in a world of worker versus company how would you expect the district court to sort that out i mean the faa be suppose to resolve these thing quickly in a summary fashion section say if there be a dispute over whether there be a contract to arbitrate it be suppose to go to a summary trial not five year of discovery and all the glory that entail that we be familiar all painfully familiar with these day but how how would you advise us to write that portion of the opinion so be it safe to say that we have at least common ground on one thing maybe a few thing today but at least on this that the proceeding may not be limit to the form of the document before us but should be summary in nature ,170.60000000000005,Roberts Court,"Oct 3, 2018",New Prime Inc.,Dominic Oliveira,17-340,"Feb 26, 2018","Jan 15, 2019",115.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2018,Nutraceutical Corp. v. Lambert,115,Neil Gorsuch,"Well, before we leave -- before we leave 26(b), there is a bit of a complication, right? It says that we can extend time or permit an act to be done after the time expires. And then what it -- after having given that authority to the court, it then takes away the authority to extend the time to file. It doesn't take away both of those things and they're disjunctive. So what do we do about that? So what work does that language then do to permit an act to be done after the deadline? Why doesn't your interpretation itself render that language a nullity? I had hoped you might. (Laughter.) So have I. (Laughter.) Give me an example, though, because 26(b) is entitled extension, extending time. So I would have thought that it would have had to do something about time. And I'm just struggling to come up with an example of what work that language does under your interpretation. Well, are we slicing the baloney pretty thinly? I mean, what's unique, all right? A judge misinforming a party about the time remaining to appeal sounds pretty terrible. But I can imagine a lot more terrible things than that. Hurricanes, lightning, all of Justice Breyer's wonderful parade of horribles, all right? (Laughter.) Why aren't those all unique circumstances too? Don't you really have to argue that Thompson's wrong and that, in fact, the rules here preclude any equitable tolling, and unique circumstances is a species of equitable tolling? Doesn't that have to be your argument? Well, but in -- in Thompson, we -- I'm sorry, please. Is -- is the upshot of your argument, though, counsel, that so long as it's a non-jurisdictional rule, equitable tolling must always apply? Congress couldn't authorize a truly mandatory statutory deadline? Okay. So if -- if there is room for what the Chief Justice suggests remains, why isn't this the paradigm case? I mean, how -- how clear could Congress through the rule-making committee have been? In multiple places, in multiple ways making clear through language like ""must"" and expressly excluding times for appeal, I mean, gosh, if this isn't good enough, what is? Well, we have Robinson that takes care of that problem, he says, so we have precedent there. So, again, how -- how much clearer could the rules have been but for maybe that one example, the precedent plugs that hole? Well -- Counsel -- -- I -- I think -- I think you have two possible lines of response to Justice Ginsburg's question, and I'm curious which you choose. So, if Thompson doesn't apply to jurisdictional statutes, one could say it does apply to mandatory but inflexible claims processing rules because it's not a species of equitable tolling at all; it is, in fact, a rule of judicial administration that, when it's our fault, shame on us. Or one could say, yeah, let's be honest, it's a form of equitable tolling and, therefore, shouldn't apply, just as it doesn't to jurisdictional rules, it shouldn't apply to mandatory claims processing rules, but should remain a viable option otherwise. And that would harmonize Bowles with this line of cases. Which of those choices should we make and why? ",well before we leave before we leave b there be a bit of a complication right it say that we can extend time or permit an act to be do after the time expire and then what it after have give that authority to the court it then take away the authority to extend the time to file it do not take away both of those thing and they be disjunctive so what do we do about that so what work do that language then do to permit an act to be do after the deadline why do not your interpretation itself render that language a nullity i have hop you might laughter so have i laughter give me an example though because b be entitle extension extend time so i would have think that it would have have to do something about time and I be just struggle to come up with an example of what work that language do under your interpretation well be we slice the baloney pretty thinly i mean what be unique all right a judge misinform a party about the time remain to appeal sound pretty terrible but i can imagine a lot more terrible thing than that hurricane lightning all of justice breyer s wonderful parade of horribles all right laughter why be not those all unique circumstance too do not you really have to argue that thompson s wrong and that in fact the rule here preclude any equitable tolling and unique circumstance be a specie of equitable tolling do not that have to be your argument well but in in thompson we I be sorry please be be the upshot of your argument though counsel that so long as it be a non jurisdictional rule equitable tolling must always apply congress could not authorize a truly mandatory statutory deadline okay so if if there be room for what the chief justice suggest remains why be not this the paradigm case i mean how how clear could congress through the rule make committee have be in multiple place in multiple way make clear through language like must and expressly exclude time for appeal i mean gosh if this be not good enough what be well we have robinson that take care of that problem he say so we have precedent there so again how how much clearer could the rule have be but for maybe that one example the precedent plug that hole well counsel i i think i think you have two possible line of response to justice ginsburg s question and I be curious which you choose so if thompson do not apply to jurisdictional statute one could say it do apply to mandatory but inflexible claim processing rule because it be not a specie of equitable toll at all it be in fact a rule of judicial administration that when it be our fault shame on us or one could say yeah let us be honest it be a form of equitable tolling and therefore should not apply just as it do not to jurisdictional rule it should not apply to mandatory claim process rule but should remain a viable option otherwise and that would harmonize bowles with this line of case which of those choice should we make and why ,206.38,Roberts Court,"Nov 27, 2018",Nutraceutical Corporation,Troy Lambert,17-1094,"Jun 25, 2018","Feb 26, 2019",115.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2018,"Virginia Uranium, Inc. v. Warren",115,Neil Gorsuch,"Well, but, Mr. Cooper -- -- Mr. Cooper, then -- then we -- don't we get into trouble under Shady Grove of guessing what the motivations of a state legislature are and all the methodological, epistemological, and federalism questions that that raises? What do we do about that? I know we do it in the Fourteenth -- Fourteenth Amendment context, for example, but I'm -- -- I'm hard pressed to come up with many other examples where we -- where we look at a state legislative purpose and -- and -- and decide its permissibility based on our assessment of -- of legislative motive. So we're just stuck with purpose whether we like it or not. I -- I -- I got it. But is PG&E perhaps distinguishable on this basis: That at least there California was directly regulating the construction of nuclear power plants, prohibiting them, and that is an area under, what is it, 2021(c) that's expressly preempted. Here, you have efforts to regulate mining, an upstream activity, that are not expressly dealt with in the statute. So what do we do about that? Well, but that -- that -- I'm sorry to interrupt, but I just want to narrow the question so that we might be more productive, for -- for me, helpfully for me. There, California was regulating construction. And that's -- that's dealt with by (c), but (k), I grant you, 2021(k), does seem to have a carveout based on purpose. You got me there, okay? (Laughter.) But I think Justice White was saying, well, within the construction world, all right, we have this carveout under (k) that we have to deal with, and California might regulate construction for purposes other than safety considerations, for economic or other considerations. What do we do about it when -- when a state comes along and says, I'm not even going to regulate construction, I'm not even going to get into that game, I'm not in the (c) game at all? Why would we look at (k)? Why would we look at anything? Why wouldn't we just say this is just not an area that Congress regulated? Congress just couldn't come to agreement on how to regulate mining? General, I -- I -- I understand that's a nice Tenth Circuit case, so well done. (Laughter.) But it doesn't bind this Court. So what do we do about -- I'm stuck where Justice Kagan is, and so it's not going to help me to cite a Tenth Circuit case, I'm sorry, colleagues. (Laughter.) But I -- I want to know from first principles why PG&E isn't simply explained as a construction case. And construction, I don't see whether and how in the statute in (c). I see construction, period. And California was regulating construction in some fashion. Here -- here, it's mining. And maybe Congress should have preempted in mining, instead of just starting with milling, but it didn't. So why isn't that the end of the case? But, General, even under your standard, we have a problem of mixed motives, because every piece of legislation has a variety of motives behind it. We have a lot of congressmen with a lot of different purposes. I'm not sure I understand how you're going to solve the problem. In Virginia, we have in this record evidence that they're concerned both about -- -- environmental and economic impacts from mining itself, as well as with other things. So what do we do with those cases where, at the end of the day, it's indeterminate? Once you start -- I'm sorry, please. No, go ahead. But, counsel, what I'm hearing is rationale basis review. Is there any rationale basis on which a legislator could vote for that? Okay, fine, if that's what you're asking. But to layer purpose on top of it introduces all of the complications that Justice Kagan has alluded to, which is, if we're going to start inquiring into purpose, one state may not be able to do the same thing another state may be able to do simply because of our assessment of what was in somebody's mind. And if we start looking at this statute, I don't even know where to begin, because it talks about the environmental and local resource impacts of mining and milling and tailings and everything else.

2018,Nielsen v. Preap,115,Neil Gorsuch,"Along those lines, Mr. Tripp, does the government have any view about if ever the obligation under (c) lapses? Could it be 30 years? Could it be -- Yeah. The obligation to take into custody under (c)(1). Thirty years, and the government was aware of him the entire time and chose not to act. Kind of a laches argument. Is there any limit on the government's power? All right. But now we're -- -- we're quibbling, Mr. Tripp. Mr. Tripp, we're quibbling, all right? Justice Breyer's question is my question and I really wish you'd answer it. We can quibble over what constitutes a crime of moral turpitude, but they're legion, they're legion, and whether it's a bus transfer or whatever hypothetical, it doesn't matter. All right. Fifty years later, a minor crime, you say, yes, the government must come and arrest him, right? Well, Ms. Wang, on the -- Ms. Wang, your -- your -- Oh, no, if you go ahead and finish -- -- but I've got a question after. Please. Okay. You've hinged a lot on the language, and you've told us to ignore what's happened after 1996 and, in response to Justice Sotomayor, went back to that language, ""when the alien is released."" But, if we're going to focus really carefully on the language, what do we do about the fact that that is an adverbial phrase? And you're asking us to suggest that it modifies the noun ""alien"" and limits the class of aliens that are involved. ""Alien"" is a noun. Adverbs don't usually modify nouns. They usually modify verbs. And the verb here is ""shall take into custody."" So why isn't it that the duty, ""shall take into custody,"" is modified by the adverb, ""when the alien is released,"" okay, and so the government's obligation begins at that moment. We know that's when the ""shall take into custody"" duty starts. But the class of aliens, the who, the noun, has nothing to do with the adverb. Now that's the question my fifth grade grammar teacher would have, all right? And so I pose it to you. Usually they modify the verb. So let's start there. Why should we -- you're asking us to take a rather unusual view of grammar, one I think I'd have to delve pretty deep in the footnotes to find. So why would I do that? This -- this, I won't argue with you about. I'm not sure I -- I mean, I follow the example, but I'm not sure I buy it, and let me tell you why. And it's a neat example. I commend you. Well done. (Laughter.) I think -- I think my fifth grade grammar teacher would love this discussion, but I would say to you or I'd challenge you with this, that, again, there you're modifying the verb, when you're supposed to harvest it, okay? And that's the first -- the first section. The second section, you're saying, okay, whatever you've harvested, the grapes that we've described that you have harvested. You still have to have harvested them. So it still depends upon the verb in that second paragraph, the verb plus the noun as referred to in the second paragraph. So I'm not sure it gets around the problem. Help me out. ",along those line mr tripp do the government have any view about if ever the obligation under c lapse could it be year could it be yeah the obligation to take into custody under c thirty year and the government be aware of him the entire time and choose not to act kind of a laches argument be there any limit on the government s power all right but now we be we be quibble mr tripp mr tripp we be quibble all right justice breyer s question be my question and i really wish you would answer it we can quibble over what constitute a crime of moral turpitude but they be legion they be legion and whether it be a bus transfer or whatever hypothetical it do not matter all right fifty year later a minor crime you say yes the government must come and arrest him right well ms wang on the ms wang your your oh no if you go ahead and finish but I have get a question after please okay you have hinge a lot on the language and you have tell us to ignore what be happen after and in response to justice sotomayor go back to that language when the alien be release but if we be go to focus really carefully on the language what do we do about the fact that that be an adverbial phrase and you be ask us to suggest that it modify the noun alien and limit the class of alien that be involve alien be a noun adverb do not usually modify noun they usually modify verb and the verb here be shall take into custody so why be not it that the duty shall take into custody be modify by the adverb when the alien be release okay and so the government s obligation begin at that moment we know that be when the shall take into custody duty start but the class of alien the who the noun have nothing to do with the adverb now that be the question my fifth grade grammar teacher would have all right and so i pose it to you usually they modify the verb so let us start there why should we you be ask us to take a rather unusual view of grammar one i think I would have to delve pretty deep in the footnote to find so why would i do that this this i will not argue with you about I be not sure i i mean i follow the example but I be not sure i buy it and let me tell you why and it be a neat example i commend you well do laughter i think i think my fifth grade grammar teacher would love this discussion but i would say to you or I would challenge you with this that again there you be modify the verb when you be suppose to harvest it okay and that be the first the first section the second section you be say okay whatever you have harvest the grape that we have describe that you have harvest you still have to have harvest them so it still depend upon the verb in that second paragraph the verb plus the noun as refer to in the second paragraph so I be not sure it get around the problem help me out ,173.99999999999997,Case pending,"Oct 10, 2018","Kirstjen Nielsen, Secretary of Homeland Security, et al.","Mony Preap, et al.",16-1363,"Mar 19, 2018",,115.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2018,Stokeling v. United States,115,Neil Gorsuch,"Counsel, I'm stuck there too, because if Congress uses the word robbery, we wouldn't normally think that it's excluding more than half the states' statutes that are defining robbery. That -- that -- that just seems like a strike against the statutory reading you're asking us to adopt. And -- and I understand there's the residual clause, but Congress used the term ""robbery"" -- -- and we've said it used it in the ordinary sense at the time of adoption. And at the time of adoption, it appears that, as Justice Alito suggested, over half the states would have included this kind of conduct. Counsel, let's say we -- we disagree with your understanding of Duenas, and we think that if it's clear on the face of a statute that conduct is encompassed. Under the elements approach in Taylor, then that's how we would define it. Does that alter the number of states that you think would be knocked out under your approach? Well, counsel, I'm not sure that quite solves the problem, though, because the statute on its face says not just force or violence or assault, but it says ""or putting in fear."" That is sufficient to constitute robbery in Florida. And Robinson I'm not sure helps you very much because I think it's susceptible to a reading of saying, in the cases of purse snatching where force is alleged as the mode for creating a robbery, then you need whatever -- whatever you've been talking about with Justice Kagan and Justice Sotomayor. But I don't read Robinson as suggesting force is the only way of establishing robbery under Florida or doing anything to eliminate the disjunctive language of ""or putting in fear."" What do I do about that? I -- I don't care what Petitioner has challenged. (Laughter.) I'm asking you why isn't that a problem under Taylor for the government in this case? But fear of force is not the same thing as force, right? So why don't you lose? So you think the putting in fear prong is always and can only be accomplished by threats of force? Do you know that -- do we know that's right? Is there any evidence that that's right? By -- by what -- what authority? Robinson isn't -- Robinson doesn't do that. Let -- let's put that aside for the moment, say we disagree with you. How many states have a robbery statute that would be left under ACCA under your opposing counsel's interpretation? No. Basic or aggravated. The -- the problem I -- I have with that, counsel, and hopefully you can help me with this, is you keep coming back to the -- the -- the belief that Congress wished to or intended to keep in common law robbery in its simple form, but Curtis Johnson expressly rejects the common law definition of force. So -- -- what do we do about that? Well, as the dissent pointed out and -- and the majority acknowledged, the misdemeanor/felony line at common law simply meant: One, you're put to death, and the other you're put in prison. So it wasn't -- it wasn't quite the same line that we have today. And that was the common law definition of robbery. Robbery was a misdemeanor -- -- often. Often it was. But the force required was very minimal at common law. And the majority expressly rejects that in Curtis Johnson as sufficient to satisfy the statute. Now maybe that's wrong. Maybe you want to revisit Curtis Johnson. I've heard a lot of arguments today that seem along those lines. But what do we do if we don't? Which we acknowledged was the common law definition.

2018,Weyerhaeuser Company v. United States Fish and Wildlife Service,115,Neil Gorsuch,"Mr. Bishop -- -- if I -- No, not at all. Maybe you can help me out with this. Let's suppose for now that I would agree with you and that we could review this. What more would you expect the Secretary to say, or could say, given the state of scientific evidence before the Secretary? That's not clear to me. The Secretary says there's -- there's just not any evidence of the benefits of exclusion that I -- that I can put a number on. And isn't -- isn't the way the statute written put some burden of proof incumbent upon the landowner or lessee to come forward with something quantifying the benefits of exclusion? And what -- what -- on that, my question is, what more would you ask the Secretary to do? The Secretary did quantify the economic benefits exclusion and then said, compared to the benefits of inclusion, they're indeterminate. And, therefore, the burden of proving exclusion has not been met. And that burden, it seems to me, rests with you. So suppose I -- there's some judicial review possible here. Do we need to get into how many angels dance on the head of that pin if you -- if you've got no real complaint at the end of the day with the adequacy of the Secretary's -- -- reasoning? Well, could you explain that to me? But why -- why -- -- why is that so, Mr. Kneedler, though? I mean, it might be a few more dollars to pull up the asphalt and then put down the ephemeral ponds. Why would a parking lot make the difference? Why would that be an unreasonable effort necessarily? And where does all this come from in the statute? Where do you get reasonable efforts in the statute? Well, runs throughout. Can you show me where? I don't see reasonable efforts there. It's not there. Oh, I don't doubt under Section 7 the government has enormous powers to help species, whether in critical habitat or elsewhere. All right? There's nothing preventing the government from purchasing land or taking other actions to protect an endangered species, whether on critical habitat or elsewhere, right? It's a supplementary power, though, you'd agree? Do you -- Suppose the missing -- Could -- could this -- Let's -- let's assume for the moment that this isn't habitat and, therefore, couldn't be designated as critical habitat. Could the Secretary take other actions to identify this land as critical to the survival of the species, even if it isn't currently habitat? Is there anything in Section 7 or elsewhere in the statute that would prohibit that? The way I read the statute, it says that, you know, the Secretary has to take actions to avoid jeopardizing the continued existence of any endangered species, or result in the destruction of habitat, critical habitat. So there's -- there's an ""or"" there. And it seems to me, I -- I wonder, isn't the Secretary fully endowed with authority to take other actions, even if this isn't critical habitat, to identify this land as important to the future survival of the species? Right. That's the operative -- -- action part of the statute. I -- if you can just answer my question -- -- I'd be grateful. Is there anything that prohibits the Secretary -- Right. My question is: Why isn't it under the statute, given that language that says specifically that the agency -- the agency can take cognizance of the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species, quite apart from preserving its threatened habitat? It seems to me there are two duties that the Secretary has there, and this would fit neatly under at least one of them, if not the second. The agency -- The agency does lots of things to protect species, endangered species, beyond protecting their habitat, doesn't it?

2018,Gamble v. United States,115,Neil Gorsuch,"Counsel, I apologize for ping-ponging you from the -- from the framing back to the present, but I'd like to return you to Justice Breyer's question about the impact this might have on civil rights organizations and -- and others. You know, the stare decisis considerations, one of which would be are we upsetting settled expectations currently? You started, but I'm -- I'd like you to develop that further. I didn't get a complete answer. I -- I think the question, though, is, of all the errors this Court has made over the years -- (Laughter.) -- why this one? Why should we care about this one? I -- I -- I -- Counsel -- counsel, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I think -- I think we've got that, okay? I think it's just a practical question. It took until last year for this Court to overrule Korematsu. Why is this case, practically, today important? And I guess, counsel -- Well, but I think that's exactly the problem that is practically more apparent today or at least of potential concern that counsel might have addressed, and that is, with the proliferation of federal crimes, I think over 4,000 statutes now and several hundred thousand regulations, the opportunity to -- for the government to seek a successive prosecution if it's unhappy with even the most routine state prosecution is a problem. Justice Brennan was concerned about it in Bartkus. In that case, there was some evidence of manipulation even by federal authorities to secure a second conviction in state court. Why shouldn't that be a practical concern we ought to be more concerned about today? Well, you know, I wonder about that because, in our prior cases, we hinged on two things, in Bartkus, among other places. One was incorporation, and we were concerned that the federal government would be at a disadvantage compared to states without this rule because states were not bound then by the Double Jeopardy Clause and could pursue a second prosecution after a failed federal prosecution. So why shouldn't the reverse be true, we thought. That rationale has now disappeared with incorporation. And we've since revisited a very similar -- similar issue in the Fourth Amendment context in Elkins, where we used to allow federal prosecutors to use illegally obtained evidence, and now we don't. So that rationale seems to have, in fact, changed over time. So that might be one -- one argument. And then -- and then the other is, again, with the -- with the -- in Bartkus, we relied on the -- on the -- and elsewhere on -- on the promise that prosecutors wouldn't do this in routine cases. And, you know, at least to some eyes, this might look like a pretty routine case, where -- as did Bartkus itself. And why shouldn't we be concerned about those two things? Well, why not? We do it in -- in civil cases all the time, right? And we -- we won't enforce judgments that are shams. We won't enforce judgments when there are different elements. We won't enforce judgments when jeopardy acquittal hasn't attached, so claim preclusion wouldn't apply. But why is it that civil defendants, corporations, businesspeople, get the benefit of this rule but not criminal defendants, least amongst us? But -- but -- but as I understand it -- and tell me if I'm wrong -- the common-law countries, Great Britain and Canada, do? But, counsel, just -- before we get to more examples, I thought Justice Ginsburg's point was worth exploring a little bit more. I -- I had thought in this country the people were the sovereign and that sovereignty was divided, exercise of sovereignty was divided, not multiplied. So it was divided between the federal government and the state governments, Ninth and Tenth Amendment. And that it is awkward, isn't it, to say that there are two sovereigns who get to multiply offenses against you? I can't think of another case where federalism is used, as Justice Ginsburg indicated, to allow greater intrusions against the person, rather than to protect more against them. So, counsel, it seems like the ones that you can't cooperate you could solve by getting to the courthouse first, right? Can I ask one question on -- on -- on stare decisis that we haven't explored so far? And that's reliance. The government doesn't make a reliance argument here as far as I can tell. It says that there's going to be some systemic trouble if we were to change the rule, and confusion. But you -- you can't -- you haven't suggested, I don't think, that -- that a -- a prosecutor has a right to rely on an unconstitutional rule to put someone in prison. I mean, that wouldn't be a thing, would it? If we -- if we were convinced, though, the Constitution stood one way, against you, just hypothetically, you wouldn't -- you wouldn't argue that the government has a reliance interest to keep people in prison despite an unconstitutional rule, would you? Well, no. How about 50 -- Let's just say 51 percent, they've persuaded us 51 percent that the Constitution's meaning under any sort of interpretation, just hypothetically, is against the government. Would it be appropriate, in the government's view, to keep people in prison in those circumstances?

2018,Henry Schein Inc. v. Archer and White Sales Inc.,115,Neil Gorsuch,"Good question. Well, Mister -- But -- but what does even that mean? Clearly, there's a bona fide dispute when two parties are litigating all the way to the United States Supreme Court. (Laughter.) Right? And so I know it's a small exception today, but the experience of this Court has been when it creates small exceptions, they tend to become larger ones with time. And -- and the whole point of arbitration, of course, is to try and streamline things. And -- and having litigation all the way up and down the federal system over wholly groundless, only to wind up in arbitration, ultimately seems highly inefficient. Isn't your real complaint here the first one, Justice Breyer's, in that there's just maybe a really good argument that clear and unmistakable proof doesn't exist in this case of -- of a desire to go to arbitration and have the arbitrator decide arbitrability? And why doesn't that take care of 90 percent of these kinds of cases? So why -- so why do we need to go down the baloney slicing road, to mix my metaphors?

2018,Biestek v. Berryhill,115,Neil Gorsuch,"So -- so ""any"" doesn't mean any? We shouldn't defer to the agency's handbook on ""any"" in this case? It's written for the -- for the experts, right? Can I ask a -- -- different -- -- just a slightly different line of questioning. If we were in federal district court -- and I know we're not, and forget about the Rules of Evidence -- but if -- if on the key issue in the case the evidence depended upon the testimony of an expert, and the expert said, ah, I'm not going to give you my underlying data, it's secret, I don't think we would hesitate to find that no rational jury could sustain a verdict in favor of the party propounding that expert. Why isn't the same true here? Okay. So you admit the principle -- -- so -- so can we just be -- Yeah, sure it does. But I -- my hypothetical is that that's the key point, and on that key point, the only piece of evidence is an expert who says I have secret data. You'd agree that we would reverse? Fine. Fine. You can modify my hypothetical. That doesn't make any difference, does it? If the district court said I'm not going to make the expert turn over his secret evidence, we'd still reverse because no rational jury could find. Not a process problem. Not a process problem. Sufficient evidence for a rational jury to reach a conclusion. Well, but if it's the key -- if it's the key fact in dispute -- and it really is in all these cases, right? I mean, that's why you have a vocational expert, is how many jobs are there going to be that this person can -- could do. If it's the key thing in dispute, and the expert has said I -- I want to keep my evidence on which I'm relying secret, it's not, as in Justice Breyer's example, saying I'm basing it on my experience over 30 years in the industry, and then you could maybe ask about that, and you could have your own expert with 30 years in the industry could opine on that. And, in fact, the Federal Rules of Evidence, of course, treat that kind of expert very differently than an expert who relies on data, as this one did. This one says, I've got secret data. All right? And it's the key question in the case. Well, then why doesn't that create an inference that -- that there -- an adverse inference that that witness is hiding something? And why doesn't that undermine substantial evidence? Yeah. Why wouldn't that be a compelling inference? I understand it's an analogy, but we're not -- we're not -- But you'd agree that -- okay. So we -- we have some common ground, that -- that an expert could say something or withhold something in -- in a way that -- on a -- on a key question that would be sufficient to undermine substantial evidence, would raise enough doubt about -- All right. How -- how is the government -- Oh, sorry. Is the government's argument that its failure to provide timely hearings should be an excuse not to comply with other requirements?

2018,"Lamps Plus, Inc. v. Varela",115,Neil Gorsuch,"Well, Mr. Pincus, could one read that same language as suggesting not that the district court gets the opportunity to decide the nature of the arbitration but merely whether there's an agreement to arbitrate and that procedures like class or individualized proceedings are not within the scope of what Section 4 contemplates and that the error here is really that the district court shouldn't have gotten in the business of specifying the procedures that would be followed in arbitration? Well, I understand that -- -- but that would then come within the context of the -- of the statutory language, is there an agreement to arbitrate. But that's not the language we have here. Counsel, if -- if this is enough, this contract under ordinary and plain state law principles where it often in the text speaks of my claims and me and I -- -- if -- if that's enough, what do we do with the due process problem that Justice Alito pointed out in Oxford Health where you would have potentially class members purportedly bound by an arbitration, this is in a court of law, where we can adjudicate absent class members rights consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment because of the procedural protections associated with court proceedings. What do we do about those absent class members in opt-out classes permitted by whatever arbitrable forum's rules prevail? Should we -- should we ignore them in considering the impact here of the Arbitration Act and normal contract principles and whether normal contract principles would abide due process, for example? And what is the context of that then? So the court says that I order class arbitration. Is the arbitrator bound by that? If the arbitrator finds that the rules are -- are not met in -- under the FAA rules that are required for class actions, can -- is he -- is he forbidden from proceeding with individualized proceedings nonetheless? Does he -- is he forbidden from engaging in the normal kind of inquiry as to whether a class would be superior or preferable in some way than I assume the FAA rules have some -- some analogue to? So -- so is -- is the arbitrator forbidden from making those inquiries by this ruling? So -- so why are we bothering -- -- with it then? I mean, if at the end of the day we're going to have this large dispute in district court over whether the contract permits this or that procedure, I mean, are we going to have disputes over whether it permits discovery? And that's a contract issue that the parties negotiated? Other kinds of procedures that might be allowed or disallowed in a -- in an arbitration proceeding? It seems like a lot of collateral expense and -- and difficulty that seems kind of a little inconsistent with the idea of getting to arbitration quickly and that the district court proceedings are supposed to be summary.

2018,Sturgeon v. Frost,115,Neil Gorsuch,"Mr. Kneedler, before we get to the abrogation question -- -- I'd just like to understand your argument on the terms of -- of the '76 Act itself a little bit better. It says the Secretary may prescribe regulations concerning boating and other activities on or relating to water within system units. And I'm paraphrasing, but I think that's about it. And I'd understand your argument better, I think, if the -- if the statute read that the Secretary could regulate water in or relating to system units, so not just water within system units but also water outside system units, like the water here that might have some downstream effect, say. But that's not what the statute says. It says that the -- it may prescribe regulations concerning boating or other activities that themselves relate to water in system units. So I would think that the government would have to prove some nexus between boating or the other activities and the water within the government's system units. And I just didn't see that story told here, how Mr. Sturgeon's hovercraft would in some way impact water within the system units, meaning public -- public lands, public waters. No. I'm -- I'm asking whether -- whether you even -- -- you even qualify under this statute before we get to abrogation. Within the outer boundaries but -- but not necessarily from -- we know from ANILCA, within the unit itself. Okay. But assume for the -- for the moment that I'm -- I'm -- I'm persuaded that it's not within the unit, okay, and that you have to rely on relating to the unit. All right? What's your argument then? Do you have one? Okay. If I don't buy that argument, then do you have anything left? That's not -- I guess that doesn't help me either. I'm wondering whether you have any argument that the use of the hovercraft outside the system units, boating activity outside the system unit -- premise me -- work on that premise -- would have any effect on the water within the system unit? Do we know from the record that the hovercraft could be heard within the system unit itself? Let alone seen. Okay. But, Mr. Kneedler -- -- I haven't yet heard an answer to Justice Sotomayor's question when it comes to water. Does the government claim plenary authority over all waterways in Alaska? Right. But everything relates. All waterways are connected.
