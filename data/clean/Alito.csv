2006,United States v. Resendiz-Ponce,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Mr. Dreeben, this touches on what troubles me about this. I wonder whether we can answer the generic question that you presented, whether the omission of an element of a criminal offense from the indictment can constitute harmless error, without considering the nature of the alleged defect here. I don't know how you can answer... if you look at whether the alleged defect here is susceptible to harmless error analysis, or whether if we were to agree with you, in fact, it is harmless, how you can answer those questions without reaching a conclusion about whether there was any defect in the indictment in the first place. And it doesn't seem to me that there's any defect in this indictment. It charges... it recites the language of the statute, it uses the word ""attempt"" which has a very well-settled meaning in the law. Any lawyer would understand exactly what is required for an attempt. It sets out the factual basis of the charge. So I don't know how you would get to the... how you can answer the second question without getting into the first question. If you went back to the... if you went back to the very demanding nineteenth century criminal pleading laws, criminal pleading laws, they would say that where you use a legal term that has a well-0established meaning such as attempt, you don't need to spell out the definition of that, of that concept. It's enough to use the term. So what the Ninth Circuit has done is to resurrect, you know, to go back to something that's more demanding than would have been required in a nineteenth century indictment and frame that as a violation of the Fifth Amendment. How far would you go with the Mechanik logic? Suppose that someone is charged by information with a felony without the person's consent and for some reason the trial judge refuses to dismiss the information and then the person is convicted. Would you say that because the petit jury returned a verdict that the fact that the person was charged with a felony by information calls for no remedy? What if it's perfectly-- --I'm sorry. What if it's perfectly clear that the error is simply a clerical error? Let's take a case where somebody is charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. And before the grand jury, we look at the transcript, we see that the prosecutor introduced evidence of five judgments of convictions for felony offenses. And the jury is properly charged that they have to find that this individual was a convicted felon. And there's simply... and then when the case is tried at, when the case is tried the defense even stipulates that the person is a convicted felon. But there's a clerical mistake in preparing the indictment. And it doesn't recite the fact that the defendant was previously convicted of a felony. It's your position that there must be a reversal there? But what if it comes up on appeal? Nothing is done until it comes up on appeal. Which is exactly in the posture of this case. You think that the... that the indictment had to specify which of the many things that he did, or the several things that he did when he approached the border constituted the overt act that the Ninth Circuit... he walked up to the border and he did a number of things to try to get into the United States. And you think that the indictment has to specify that walking up wasn't a substantial step, but presenting the documents might have been, whether it was walking up, presenting the documents, lying to the agent? You have to go into that level of detail in order to satisfy the Fifth Amendment? And the defendant could be convicted of an attempt under such an indictment, could he not?

",mr dreeben this touch on what troubles me about this i wonder whether we can answer the generic question that you present whether the omission of an element of a criminal offense from the indictment can constitute harmless error without consider the nature of the allege defect here i do not know how you can answer if you look at whether the allege defect here be susceptible to harmless error analysis or whether if we we be to agree with you in fact it be harmless how you can answer those question without reach a conclusion about whether there be any defect in the indictment in the first place and it do not seem to me that there be any defect in this indictment it charge it recite the language of the statute it use the word attempt which have a very well settle meaning in the law any lawyer would understand exactly what be require for an attempt it set out the factual basis of the charge so i do not know how you would get to the how you can answer the second question without get into the first question if you go back to the if you go back to the very demand nineteenth century criminal pleading law criminal pleading law they would say that where you use a legal term that have a well established mean such as attempt you do not need to spell out the definition of that of that concept it be enough to use the term so what the ninth circuit have do be to resurrect you know to go back to something that be more demanding than would have be require in a nineteenth century indictment and frame that as a violation of the fifth amendment how far would you go with the mechanik logic suppose that someone be charge by information with a felony without the person s consent and for some reason the trial judge refuse to dismiss the information and then the person be convict would you say that because the petit jury return a verdict that the fact that the person be charge with a felony by information call for no remedy what if it be perfectly I be sorry what if it be perfectly clear that the error be simply a clerical error let us take a case where somebody be charge with possession of a firearm by a convict felon and before the grand jury we look at the transcript we see that the prosecutor introduce evidence of five judgment of conviction for felony offense and the jury be properly charge that they have to find that this individual be a convict felon and there be simply and then when the case be try at when the case be try the defense even stipulate that the person be a convicted felon but there be a clerical mistake in prepare the indictment and it do not recite the fact that the defendant be previously convict of a felony it be your position that there must be a reversal there but what if it come up on appeal nothing be do until it come up on appeal which be exactly in the posture of this case you think that the that the indictment have to specify which of the many thing that he do or the several thing that he do when he approach the border constitute the overt act that the ninth circuit he walk up to the border and he do a number of thing to try to get into the united state and you think that the indictment have to specify that walk up be not a substantial step but present the document might have be whether it be walk up present the document lie to the agent you have to go into that level of detail in order to satisfy the fifth amendment and the defendant could be convict of an attempt under such an indictment could he not but in that situation you would not know what the substantial step be would you the indictment would not tell you what the substantial step be if the defendant be convict of the lesser include offense of attempt under an indictment charge the complete offense ,242.63,Roberts Court,"Oct 10, 2006",United States,Juan Resendiz-Ponce,05-998,"Apr 17, 2006","Jan 9, 2007",112,1.0,1.0,0.0,1

And there would be reasonable suspicion then from that moment on, for at least a brief detention of the individual to determine whether in fact there was a warrant for the individual. So all we're talking about, the only period of potential seizure that we have to worry about is up to the moment when the officer sees Mr. Brendlin. In other words, any seizure after that point would be supported by reasonable suspicion? What if the officer went, before even approaching the car got on the loudspeaker and said: ""Driver remain in the car; passenger, you're free to go? "" What's the difference between that situation where the police officer says on the loudspeaker passenger remain, driver you're free to go, and the example that the State has in their brief, in which a car is stopped and as a result of the way it's stopped on a narrow road, the other cars behind that car are for some other period of time prevented from going forward? What's the difference between those two situations? Well, how do you explain the justification for stopping if there is the seizure, for stopping the innocent passenger because the driver has committed a traffic violation? If that's a seizure of the passenger, then it's a seizure without reasonable suspicion of probable cause, right? What is this period of time that we are talking about when Mr. Brendlin might or might not have felt that he was free to leave?

It doesn't speak at all to the issue of 1447. The difference between that immunity and Powerex's status is what? It's simply the fact that there's a stronger interest in allowing immediate appellate review, Federal appellate review of the determination of the remand of a party that claims to be a sovereign as opposed to Powerex's status as an organ? If we think that Powerex, that there's a strong interest in having Powerex remain in Federal court if it's entitled To that under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, that would be suffer to get around 1447(d)?

How is your argument here consistent with that? But... well, the meaning of a RICO conspiracy in the criminal context is very well known. I don't know why it matters whether it is defined in the statute or not; and there is no requirement in that that anybody be injured by virtue of an unlawful, overt act. Why is it appropriate there to look to the law of civil conspiracy and yet inappropriate here to look to the law of civil fraud? No, I understand that, but when the pattern of racketeering activity consists of predicate acts of mail fraud, why isn't... why does not Beck point you to the word RICO statute? So why if you look to civil conspiracy to understand what RICO statute, why do you not look to RICO statute? But you can say the same in Beck. It would make civil conspiracy the predicate act in RICO, rather than... the RICO violation, rather than criminal conspiracy. But the RICO statute doesn't say you can recover if you're injured by reason of conspiracy, without any elaboration. It says ""by reason of a violation of this statute. "" And therefore you look to 1962(d), which tells you what the violation is. It's a RICO... it's a criminal RICO conspiracy. So I just don't see how that argument works.

The Seventh Circuit in the first appeal in this case interpreted promotion very broadly. And then, I guess it felt that it had boxed itself in and that's what led to this interpretation of proceeds. But if you interpret those other concepts more narrowly, you don't have the same kind of overlap. Mr. Roberts, isn't it true that the Seventh Circuit's interpretation of proceeds doesn't really solve these problems except in the case of an unprofitable business? In the case of a profitable illegal enterprise, all of the same problems exist. But this doesn't... ""proceeds"" must mean the same thing in every money laundering case, doesn't it? And every money laundering case is not based on a gambling business. There are drug businesses and all sorts of other predicates. Can it mean something different in... depending on the underlying illegal activity? Let me go back to the question of the definition of ""proceeds"". Isn't it very unlikely that Congress would have wanted... wanted to adopt the net income definition in light of the legal issues and the problems of proof that that would involve? Let's take the example of an international drug ring that has assets in a foreign country. They may have crops. They may have processing plants, warehouses, trucks, airplanes, et cetera. They ship millions of dollars of drugs into the United States. They get millions of dollars in gross revenue here every year. They hire a professional money launderer to launder the money here. Now, the Government wants to prosecute the money... the person they hired plus members of the organization. The person they hired may not know and may not care whether the money that was being laundered was profits or not. And how are you going to prove what... whether this enterprise was a profitable enterprise or not? They may have... and they may have enormous gross revenue, but they may have... they may have enormous expenses overseas. They may have bought a lot of warehouses and equipment. They may have lost a lot of things because they were raided by the government, destroyed the factory, killed the plants. It becomes as impossible situation, and why would Congress ever have adopted a definition like that? I'm sure that's true.

Alito, Jr.","That would be a good argument if the sole basis for retirement under your system was years of service, but it's not just years of service, isn't that right? You can't take your... you couldn't take your statute and erase all the references to age and have the statute work, could you? Because the ADA expressly allows them to do that; isn't that right? It seems to me that what Kentucky is trying to do is to, at least in part, provide make-whole benefits for a police officer who becomes disabled below the age of 55. So what they want to do is to say we want to give you the benefit that you would have received if you had not been hurt on the job and therefore unable to work and had been able to work to the normal retirement age. Now, if that's correct, is that an illegitimate objective? And if it's not an illegitimate objective, is there any way that they can do that consistent with your understanding of the ADEA? Because when someone is over the retirement age, it's rather hard to see how many years you would add on projecting how long that person would continue to work beyond the age of retirement eligibility. So if they want to do that and they have a case of a police officer who works beyond 55... the officer is 55-plus with 10 years of service and then becomes disabled... you say they have to give that person 10 years of credit. But if do you that, aren't you going to be... you're going to be undercompensating the younger person who gets disabled and overcompensating the people over 55 who gets disabled who may not... it may not be realistic to think that someone's going to continue to work as a police officer until 65.

Alito, Jr.","Suppose the district court in this case had said I'm considering an above-Guidelines sentence based on facts that are in the record in the pre-sentence report to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant. Would that be adequate notice? You seem to be requiring a very specific kind of notice, almost as if the district court has to say this is the sentence that I'm considering, and these are the exact reasons that I'm considering; now what do you have to say about that. Is that what you're asking? But why would the-- Well, why shouldn't this rule be dealt with by further rulemaking? It is very clear that when 32(h) was adopted, departure had a specific meaning under the Guidelines. And what we're talking about now was not contemplated at all by the rulemakers at that time. Now, applying 3553(a) in this situation raises different problems, and there are issues regarding the specificity of the notice that's required and the timing of the notice. Why shouldn't this be dealt with by further rulemaking when those... where those things can be handled in a comprehensive way rather than by the haphazard development of case law by the courts of appeals if we agree with your position. Are you saying-- --Are you saying that if they had in mind at the time that Booker might be coming down the road. There would be non-Guidelines variances from the Sentencing Guidelines. How specific does the notice have to be? I take it it's not enough just to recite one of the 3553(a) factors. Well, what was required here? But didn't the decision that the Guidelines are not mandatory make what used to be known as Guidelines departures completely irrelevant? A case that would qualify for a Guidelines departure would, by definition, be a case in which the 3553(a) factors justified a sentence other than a Guidelines sentence? So I don't understand why there's any need to go through the departure analysis any longer at all. I just don't understand that. You're not... a court... a sentencing court, after concluding that there is no ground for a departure under Booker and the later cases, then has to consider the 3553(a) question. So the decision about the departures is irrelevant. It is not dispositive; and, if the court finds that the case qualified for a Guidelines departure, as I said before, by definition, that is going to be a case where the 3553(a) factors warranted a non-Guidelines sentence anyway.

I think you have a good argument in comparing him to some of the white jurors, in particular Mr. Laws. But my understanding is you never relied on Mr. Laws before the Louisiana Supreme Court. Is that correct? But the arguments as to each of them are different. The argument as to Mr. Yeager, I think is much weaker. He had one event on a Sunday and he was told you don't have to worry about that, this case is going to be over by Sunday. So that's quite different from somebody... it could be quite different from someone like Mr. Brooks or Mr. Laws. Isn't that? Well, suppose you are trying this case. You are a defense attorney, and you ask a juror, a potential juror: Would you hold it against a defendant who doesn't take the stand? And the initial answer is: I have to think about that. I'm not quite sure. Now... and then you go on, and you ask a lot of questions, and the juror comes around to saying: I understand that's a person's constitutional right. They get the... advice from a lawyer. It doesn't necessarily mean the person has something to hide, et cetera, et cetera. Does that additional questioning allay the concern that you would have had at the beginning about the fairness, the potential fairness, of the juror? The explanation for Mr. Brooks is not terribly convincing on its face. This is... was an incredibly short trial, was it not? Mr. Brooks is voir dired on Tuesday. And there's a death verdict on Friday. And the concern... the major concern about him is that he's going to worry about missing Wednesday, Thursday, Friday student teaching? But you compare him to some of the white jurors, particularly, I think, Mr. Laws. Mr. Laws seemed to have a more compelling reason to be worried about not being... about being in court. He was a contractor. He had houses he had to finish. His wife had recently had surgery. He was taking kids back and forth to the school. We have no idea... we have no idea what this man looked like. We have no idea about his demeanor, his tone of voice. This could have been... there could have been very legitimate reasons for doing it. There could be no legitimate reasons for doing it. But nobody asked what reason for doing it was. ",can i ask you about one of the factor it be hard to discuss them all at the same time what be the relevance of strike of black lawyer that you do not argue we be base on race it be hard for me to understand why that be relevant in this calculation suppose there be a case where it be perfectly clear that certain strike we be not racially motivate let us say the prosecution have the strategy of strike every lawyer who be on the panel it strike every white lawyer and it strike every black lawyer then what be the relevance of the fact that the black lawyer we be peremptorily challenge that be right you be make the argument there we be five african american juror who we be the subject of prosecutorial peremptory challenge and but you do not claim that three of those strike we be base on race do you there we be a large number of strike in miller el this be a much small number could you just explain if you can what be the relevance of strike that you do not even claim we be racially motivate mr bright you make good argument about comparison between white juror and black juror what do we do with the comparison that you be make now to white juror who we be never bring to the attention of the louisiana supreme court i think you have a good argument in compare him to some of the white juror in particular mr law but my understanding be you never rely on mr law before the louisiana supreme court be that correct but the argument as to each of them be different the argument as to mr yeager i think be much weak he have one event on a sunday and he be tell you do not have to worry about that this case be go to be over by sunday so that be quite different from somebody it could be quite different from someone like mr brook or mr law be not that well suppose you be try this case you be a defense attorney and you ask a juror a potential juror would you hold it against a defendant who do not take the stand and the initial answer be i have to think about that I be not quite sure now and then you go on and you ask a lot of question and the juror come around to say i understand that be a person s constitutional right they get the advice from a lawyer it do not necessarily mean the person have something to hide et cetera et cetera do that additional questioning allay the concern that you would have have at the begin about the fairness the potential fairness of the juror the explanation for mr brook be not terribly convince on its face this be be an incredibly short trial be it not mr brook be voir dired on tuesday and there be a death verdict on friday and the concern the major concern about him be that he be go to worry about miss wednesday thursday friday student teaching but you compare him to some of the white juror particularly i think mr law mr law seem to have a more compelling reason to be worry about not be about be in court he be a contractor he have house he have to finish his wife have recently have surgery he be take kid back and forth to the school we have no idea we have no idea what this man look like we have no idea about his demeanor his tone of voice this could have be there could have be very legitimate reason for do it there could be no legitimate reason for do it but nobody ask what reason for do it be ,204.14,Roberts Court,"Dec 4, 2007",Allen Snyder,State of Louisiana,06-10119,"Jun 25, 2007","Mar 19, 2008",112,1.0,1.0,1.0,1

Before 1994 the offense had to be classified as a felony. Then they added this definition of ""felony drug offense"", and as I understand it your reading is that now the offense must be classified as a felony and it must be punishable by more, by imprisonment for more than a year. What would be the reason for adding this new requirement as you see it, that it be punishable by more than a year, if there were not offenses that were classified by States as felonies but were punishable by less than a year? I can't see the point unless the point was to rule those out. And you haven't cited any State statute in your brief that involved an offense that was classified as a felony and is punishable by less than a year. You cited a couple that were punishable by exactly a year, not more than a year but exactly a year. So is it your, your theory that the reason for adding this new language was to make it clear that those offenses where the maximum was 12 months, as opposed to 12 months and a day, would not be counted? But if I could just come back to that. I looked at those. You cite Ohio, North Carolina, and Arizona and those are all punishable by... they all have a maximum term of 12 months, not less than. So the difference is between 12 months and 12 months and a day? But is it plausible that's the reason why Congress added this language? They didn't want... they wanted to make sure that these felonies that were punishable by just 12 months would not be counted? What would you do with someone who was convicted... had a prior conviction of... for importing 10 tons of heroin in New Jersey, for example, where there are no felonies? What would you do with that, a very serious drug offense in a State that doesn't use the term ""felony"" at all or a foreign conviction?

The private sector provisions were already in existence when it made the statute applicable to Federal workers and there was a specific provision prohibiting retaliation in the private sector. If Congress wanted to carry that over to the Federal sector, why wouldn't they have either copied that or incorporated it? And they did neither, and in fact they enacted a provision that says that the private sector provisions are not incorporated unless they're specifically noted. And this isn't one of the ones that's noted. Would it be... would it be unkind to say that the government's position seems to be that a general ban on discrimination includes a ban on retaliation except when the government is being sued? In Jackson the government argued that discrimination on the basis of sex included retaliation. Tomorrow the government is going to argue that the prohibition of discrimination in section 1981 includes retaliation. And yet here you're arguing exactly, what seems to me exactly the opposite position. Can you say what the government's position is on Title VII, whether there is a retaliation remedy against the Federal Government? Isn't it quite the contrary, Mr. Garre, that most... if you did a statistical analysis of all the cases in which there was a retaliation claim, you doubt that you would find that a very high percentage of those are cases in which the person claiming retaliation is also the person who claimed the underlying discrimination? Do you think it's plausible that Congress intended to treat the issue of retaliation in the Federal sector differently under the various Federal anti discrimination statutes?

Well, there are many facts here that are favorable to your position, but I would appreciate it if you could articulate the rule of law that you would like us to adopt in this case, the general principle that you would like... the general rule that you would like us to adopt. Can that be the case: Any consensual relationship between a member of the tribe and a nonmember is subject to the jurisdiction of the tribal courts?

Let's say there are two Federal mail fraud cases, and you don't have to prove the amount of loss in order to convict under the mail fraud statute. In the first case, after the jury returns a guilty verdict they also return -- or together with that they answer a special interrogatory and they say the loss exceeded $10,000. In the second case, the defendant pleads guilty and admits during the plea colloquy that the amount is more than $10,000. Would there be a problem in those cases? And then-- --What is the -- What is the difference between a defendant's saying during a guilty plea colloquy, the loss was -- I admit the loss was more than $10,000; and the defendant's agreeing for sentencing purposes that the loss was more than $10,000? Did you have any authority for the -- the idea that a trial judge in a criminal case should ask the jury to answer a special interrogatory regarding a question that has no bearing on the conviction, but may have a bearing on the future immigration status of the defendant, which is what you're suggesting should be done in these tax cases? Could I ask you this, does this -- which is not exactly on point to the issue here, but does the government have a theory about how the loss is measured for purposes of this statute? Under the sentencing guidelines, the loss was a very complicated calculation, lots of rules about relevant conduct and lots of cases and different ways of proving loss, and here we just have the statute. What if you have somebody who participates in a -- in a scheme involving $100 million, the total loss is $10,000, but this person had no way of reasonably anticipating that this would be the -- the total amount of the loss, this was a minor participant, and -- where would the -- how would that come out?

So your -- your position requires us to determine that EPA's interpretation of those -- the statutory regime that you are talking about, 306 and 402, is -- is contrary to the statute. If EPA were to amend the performance standard to say that it doesn't apply in the situation in which the fill rule applies, would that be a valid regulation?

So how can we possibly affirm summary judgment here?

If all the employer-- --If all the employer has is evidence that the test results violate the four-fifths rule, is that sufficient? Well, if I could modify the question. Is there some statistical point at which that's sufficient, if it's not four-fifths, if it's nine-tenths-- --that alone would be sufficient? And why didn't it have a sufficient basis here? It -- it chose the company that framed the test, and then as soon as it saw the results, it decided it wasn't going to go forward with the promotions. The company offered to validate the test. The City refused to pay for that, even though that was part of its contract with the company. And all it has is this testimony by a competitor, Mr. Hornick, who said -- who hadn't seen the test, and he said, I could do a better test -- you should make the promotions based on this, but I could give you -- I could draw up a better test, and by the way, here's my business card if you want to hire me in the future. How's that a strong basis in the evidence? What difference does the cut-off score make?

You say -- somebody says to you, you know a car was stolen from our street last night? Oh, what car was stolen? Oh, it was the car of Mr. Jones. He knowingly stole the car of Mr. Jones. It doesn't necessarily mean that the person who stole the car knew that it was Mr. Jones's car. Who did the mugger mug? He mugged the man from Denver. You think that he knowingly mugged the man from Denver. You think that means that the mugger knew that the man was from Denver? Why is it more ambiguous? Why is it less unambiguous? I thought your argument was that this was unambiguous. What would happen if the -- the defendant doesn't -- doesn't act knowingly as to the question whether the identifying information belongs to a real person but is simply reckless as to whether the identifying information belongs to a real person? Suppose that someone buys an identification card and looks at it, and it looks like it might be a real identification card on which that person's picture has been inserted in place of the real picture, but the person can't be sure. It might really be an entirely fake card. Would that be a violation? What if the defendant chooses a name -- uses a name other than his or her own name -- gets an identification card made up with that -- and doesn't know for sure that the name that's chosen actually belongs to another person, but because it's not an extremely uncommon name, has -- knows that it's virtually certain that that name belongs to some other person who is unknown to him? Is that a violation? Well, what if it's not an extremely common name, but not an extremely uncommon name? And what if it's -- what if the defendant chooses Kevin K. Russell?

2008,Corley v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Are you arguing that the language in subsection (c) codifies the McNabb-Mallory rule? Well, there's a very big difference, isn't there, between saying we're codifying this rule, we're making it a statutory requirement, and saying, assuming that this supervisory rule that was adopted by the Supreme Court remains in place, we're creating an exception to it? Which of those two things does -- does subsection (c) do? Well, they have that textual problem, but you have at least an equally big textual problem because you want to read the first sentence of subsection (a) completely out of the statute based on some supposition about what Congress was intending to do. So really, you know, if you live by the text, you die by the text. I don't see how you're going to succeed with a subsection (c) textual analysis if you're going to disregard the text of subsection (a). And if you read subsection (c) the way you do, it makes subsection (a) mean something quite different from what it says literally. Well, now what you're -- you are not arguing that there is a specific provision that controls a general provision. You are arguing that an arguable negative inference from an arguably more specific provision reads new language into the text of a specific provision. That's what you're arguing, isn't it? Why would that be the case? The confession could still be suppressed on grounds of involuntariness? Your argument is you don't trust district judges to make accurate determinations as to whether the confession is voluntary or not. You need -- you need a rule that takes that out of their hands. What's the purpose of the -- of the requirement of prompt presentment? Mr. Dreeben, Justice Breyer suggested that there are rules of evidence other than those based on the Constitution or McNabb-Mallory that might result in the exclusion of a confession. Maybe there are such rules, but I'm trying to think of them. I can't think of what they might be. Certainly it's not hearsay. It's -- is it ever going to be ruled to be irrelevant? Is it common for a confession to be excluded under rule 403?

Why is that the answer to the -- the question? Why isn't the answer to the question that monuments generally are not -- the erection of monuments generally are not a forum? There is a fundamental difference between the speaker's corner in the park where anybody can speak and a permanent monument that takes up space, presumably limited public space. And if you have the unusual situation where you are have a monument that is really analogous to a forum, then the forum analysis would be applicable. But to apply it to something like the Washington Monument or the Jefferson Memorial is ridiculous. Let me give you this example. Just by chance yesterday I was taking a walk in a little neighborhood park, and I saw that there was a monument -- a small monument, donated, and it says right on there donated by a private neighborhood association to commemorate a number of people who were killed in the 9-11 attack on the Pentagon. And now if I searched the town records or the county record and I don't find any resolution saying they adopted this monument as their monument, does that mean that if I would like to put up a monument in the park to commemorate loved ones who died, or people who I respect, I have a First Amendment right to do that?

No, not on the question of qualified immunity. On the issue of whether there is a Fourth Amendment violation. Right. Well, the school could keep records on its students, like the police keep records on confidential informants. So if -- unless this student had a proven record of having accurately ratted out a certain number of classmates in the past, she couldn't be believed. Now, what specifically do you think is missing here? They need -- the school needed to have a direct statement from Marissa Glines that -- that Redding had the -- had the pills in her undergarments; is that correct? But you have to have direct evidence that the -- the -- it can't be based on inferences? Is that the distinction you are drawing? The location has to be supported by direct evidence.

If Marissa Glines had said specifically that Savana Redding has pills someplace on her person and she's going to distribute them at lunch in the cafeteria, would this be a different case? What is the difference between that situation and this situation? The differences are slight. Wouldn't that at least be a question that has to be decided by the trier of fact?

2008,Waddington v. Sarausad,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","When I read the opinion of the Washington Court of Appeals, it does not seem to me that what they are doing is providing a literal interpretation of the jury instruction, as I think we have to presume the jury did when they got that instruction. Washington Court of Appeals is interpreting Washington law. And they may be influenced by Washington case law, which is what they cite. They don't -- they quote the instruction but they don't say ""the crime"" means ""a crime"". That's how we interpret the language of the instruction. So there is an overlay of Washington case law, principles of accomplice liability that inform this instruction. So I don't know that you can -- it's reasonable to argue that because they misinterpreted Washington law, they were misinterpreting the literal language of the jury instruction. Could I ask you this question about the jury's question where they say we are having difficulty agreeing on a legal definition and concept of accomplice; when a person willingly participates in a group activity, is that person an accomplice to any crime committed by anyone in the group? Suppose that the judge had answered that question by saying a person who participates in group activity is guilty of the crime of second degree murder if the person acts with knowledge that his or her conduct will promote or facilitate the commission of the crime of second degree murder. Would you have a case if that answer was given? That's almost a direct quote from the instruction that was given. I put in crime of second degree murder rather than the crime. That poses a difference enough to make A, a constitutional violation and B, make it unreasonable for the Washington Court of Appeals to say that there was no constitutional violation? With the jury -- was the jury told that the arguments of counsel are not the law, that I, the judge, will tell you what the law is? But the only difference between that case, which I know very well, and this case is that in that case there was no issue about jury instructions. So what's the relevance of it? Has to do with the retroactivity whether a State can -- whether Pennsylvania had changed the interpretation of its statute, or whether what they said it meant was what it always had meant. ",when i read the opinion of the washington court of appeal it do not seem to me that what they be do be provide a literal interpretation of the jury instruction as i think we have to presume the jury do when they get that instruction washington court of appeal be interpret washington law and they may be influence by washington case law which be what they cite they do not they quote the instruction but they do not say the crime mean a crime that be how we interpret the language of the instruction so there be an overlay of washington case law principle of accomplice liability that inform this instruction so i do not know that you can it be reasonable to argue that because they misinterpret washington law they we be misinterpret the literal language of the jury instruction could i ask you this question about the jury s question where they say we be have difficulty agree on a legal definition and concept of accomplice when a person willingly participate in a group activity be that person an accomplice to any crime commit by anyone in the group suppose that the judge have answer that question by say a person who participate in group activity be guilty of the crime of second degree murder if the person act with knowledge that his or her conduct will promote or facilitate the commission of the crime of second degree murder would you have a case if that answer be give that be almost a direct quote from the instruction that be give i put in crime of second degree murder rather than the crime that pose a difference enough to make a a constitutional violation and b make it unreasonable for the washington court of appeal to say that there be no constitutional violation with the jury be the jury tell that the argument of counsel be not the law that i the judge will tell you what the law be but the only difference between that case which i know very well and this case be that in that case there be no issue about jury instruction so what be the relevance of it have to do with the retroactivity whether a state can whether pennsylvania have change the interpretation of its statute or whether what they say it mean be what it always have mean ,144.73,Roberts Court,"Oct 15, 2008","Doug Waddington, Superintendent, Washington Corrections Center",Cesar Sarausad,07-772,"Mar 17, 2008","Jan 21, 2009",112,1.0,1.0,0.0,1
2008,Herring v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Does your argument depend on the quality of the recordkeeping in this particular department? I thought your argument would apply even if this department had excellent recordkeeping procedures but nevertheless made a mistake in this instance. You're not asking for Arizona v. Evans to be overruled are you. But none of that matters for your argument, does it? You want to make it -- you want to draw a clear line between errors by -- by clerical court employees versus errors by police employees. How expeditious would it be -- suppose there's negligence on the part of both a court employee and a police department employee. What is the judge supposed to do in deciding the suppression motion? Is this a comparative negligence determination. How are -- how are you going to determine whether there's error without determining whether there's negligence? Suppose the court clerk calls up the police department and says the warrant is still outstanding, and in fact it's not. And it sends them over a physical copy of a warrant, but that warrant has been withdrawn. Now, the police could always take additional steps: They could send someone over to check the records, to look at the court docket to make sure that the warrant had not been withdrawn. So there would be causality, but it would not determine what they should-- --what their duty was. How are you going to determine where this error should be -- should be assigned? Let me give you another example. Suppose that the court clerk calls up and says -- it leaves a message, gives a message to somebody in the police department. And they memorialize that, and they say ""called up"". And let's say the warrant number is the same as the docket number of this case. So the court employee says -- writes down ""Called up"", says, ""Warrant quashed in warrant, in case 07-513. "" The court -- the police department has a record of the call, and they say, ""Received call from court clerk. "" ""Warrant to be quashed. "" ""Warrant quashed in case 07-531. "" And so the 513 is not quashed; the person is arrested. Now, who caused that? You have to have a hearing? How do you know that the police department wrote down the wrong number? How do you know what number was-- --Well, what's the justification for drawing a distinction between a court employee and everybody who works for the police department? Suppose the person who makes the mistake in the police department is a -- a person who holds a unionized position where advancement is based purely on seniority, or it's a civil service position where the person is -- is totally protected from any sort of adverse job consequences as a result of displeasure about or pleasure about how the job is being -- being performed. And what's the justification for drawing a distinction between errors committed by those two employees just based on where they fit in the organizational box? What if it's not a police officer; it is not a law enforcement officer? It is a clerical employee, or it's a computer guy. Isn't your rule also going to require hearings. If negligence is required-- --you are going to have to have a hearing on whether there was negligence. And if so, who was negligent. If only causation is required, you're going to have to have a hearing on who caused it. And will that be the case in every instance? How do you know that? What basis do you have for saying that? How many of these hearings have you examined?

When you have a defendant who starts out by firing a lawyer and engineering the withdrawal of another lawyer by threatening a lawyer, is it appropriate then to go through all of the subsequent periods and attribute the delay to the defendant or to the prosecution or as a neutral factor as if those, the initial events, hadn't occurred? We don't know how quickly this case would have gone to trial if the first lawyer hadn't been fired or if the third lawyer, I guess it was, had not been threatened and forced to withdraw. Well, what is the trial judge supposed to do? The defense attorney keeps asking for continuances for purposes of investigation. I need more time to investigate. If -- and -- and -- can the court say: You need to tell me exactly what you are doing? Aren't you giving the attorney a very perverse incentive there? I mean the delay may help the ultimate outcome of the case, and if the -- if the defense attorney can engineer enough delay, he or she may also produce a speedy-trial violation. And by your client firing the first attorney, correct? What if you have a situation in which the -- an attorney is appointed, the defendant threatens that attorney, the attorney withdraws. A second attorney is appointed, the client threatens that attorney, the attorney withdraws, and then thereafter a new attorney is pointed, and there is great delay.

2008,Puckett v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, the judge would have known about what happened anyway from -- from the presentence investigation, wouldn't he? Why should that be the case? I know plea agreements are not strictly governed by contract law, but there is an analogy and your whole argument seems to be that the government's breach rendered the plea agreement void. But why would that so? There was a plea agreement, voluntarily entered into, and then there was a breach. So, why shouldn't the issue be what is the remedy for the breach? And why shouldn't it be governed by the plain-error rule like most errors that occur at trial? But you can say that in every case in which parties enter into a contract and later there is a breach. The fact that one of the parties later breaches doesn't mean that there never was a contract. There was an agreement that he voluntarily entered into at that time. And then there was a -- subsequently there was a breach, but that doesn't mean that he involuntarily -- he did not voluntarily enter into the agreement, does it? What would counsel say about a case in which it's unclear whether there is a breach? There is a factual dispute as to whether there was a breach. Let's say the government agrees that it will reserve the right to call all relevant facts to the attention of the sentencing judge, but won't take a position on sentencing. And the prosecutor in sentencing makes certain remarks that might be interpreted as taking a position or might be interpreted as simply calling facts to the judge's attention. Would it be your position that when a defendant hears that, the defendant can sit back and wait and see whether he or she is satisfied with the sentence and then after this sentence is imposed raise the issue of breach on appeal and not be subject to plain error, rather than calling it to the attention of the sentencing judge at the time when the -- the potential breach could be adjudicated?

It is simply their -- their argument is that it informs an interpretation of the language of EEOA, which is that the State is required to take appropriate action, which is a very vague standard. Can I ask you this question about the Ninth Circuit's decision, which is what we are reviewing? Suppose -- I know there -- there is a debate about how well Nogales is doing at this time. But let's suppose Nogales came in, and they said this: We had plan A back when this was originally litigated, and now we have an entirely different plan, and this plan doesn't cost one penny more than what we were spending in 2000. But it is a very good plan, and it has produced very good results. As I read the Ninth Circuit's decision, they would not grant relief from the judgment under those circumstances, because they focus exclusively on incremental funding for EEL programs and Arizona's funding model. Isn't that correct? No, but isn't -- that isn't really my question. Isn't -- isn't it the case that the Ninth Circuit judged the -- the permissibility of relief under 60(b) solely with regard to incremental funding and Arizona's funding model? That's the way it was litigated originally, but I thought the whole focus of the motion for relief from the judgment was: We have a new plan, and it is not tied to funding, and it will produce good results without looking at incremental EEL funding. And wasn't the Ninth Circuit obligated to look at that? Why does it matter that there is -- why focus on incremental funding for ELL programs exclusively? What difference does it make where the money comes from -- where it comes from, putting aside federal money that can't be supplanted? I just don't understand that. Well, that may have been their -- that may have been their position originally, but at the time of the 60(b) hearing, what difference does it make whether the money came from funds that were designated for ELL program, or from general State funds, or from county funds? What difference does it make whether the money was taken from some other program that the school was operating? Suppose they fund -- they take the money for the ELL programs from money that was previously used for music instruction, or art, or gym, or teaching German or anything else. Now those may all be bad things, but what does that have to be with the EEOA? But the fact that you keep talking about the district court emphasizes my concern about the decision of the Ninth Circuit, which is what we are reviewing. And as I read the decision of the Ninth Circuit, they focused exclusively on incremental costs associated with ELL programs and the educational funding model that the State had at that time. Well, they say. They were required -- the Petitioners were required to demonstrate either that there are no longer incremental costs associated with ELL programs in Arizona or that Arizona's funding model was so altered as to make incremental costs issue relevant. That was their explanation of the holding, 60 -- 63A of the Speaker's appendix.

Why does it have to be political speech? Isn't it enough that it is simply speech that certain people don't want to subsidize, or speech, so that the commemoration in Hawaii may be something that 99.999 percent of the population would find very commendable, but someone is being forced to pay for that? Suppose, let's say, that one or more locals someplace else in the country are involved in very, very expensive litigation; and, as a result, the international assesses all of the locals a fee to pay -- to pay for that litigation but at the same time adopts a position that it is extremely unlikely in the future that the international will ever subsidize any other local union litigation expenses. Would the local -- would a -- would a local union not involved in that litigation -- would they -- would it be permissible for them to charge their nonmembers? Well, if you concede that, then aren't you conceding there has to be some standard by -- under which to assess whether the local union that is being required to pay the fee for extra-unit litigation expenses is getting something back in return? It's not necessary for there to be any standard under which to assess that they are getting anything back in return? If it's clear they are not getting anything back in return, it's still okay? If certain -- if certain fees are are being assessed on the theory that this is a pooling arrangement, I don't understand why you're resisting any effort to impose any standards or any inquiry as to whether it's really a pooling arrangement? Your argument seems to be that the whole analogy of a pooling arrangement is invalid. That was unrealistic, because there really is no way of telling whether any of these things is a pooling arrangement. There is no standard that could possibly be articulated that would be meaningful to determine whether something that is labelled a pooling arrangement really is in any way a pooling arrangement.

But if Price Waterhouse is understood simply as a way for a judge conducting a bench trial to look at the evidence, does it present any of the problems that have been identified with the Price Waterhouse -- that interpretation of Price Waterhouse as applied to jury trials? Well, if it's just an instruction to a judge conducting a bench trial, it could mean that if the -- if the judge sitting as the trier of fact finds that there is direct evidence, strong evidence supporting the plaintiff's claim, then the judge will need to have strong evidence, stronger evidence on the other side in order to rule against the plaintiff. It's not hard to figure out how it might work out in that situation. The problem comes when it has to be posed in the form of a jury instruction. But Desert Palace was a Title VII case, wasn't it, under the 1991 amendment to Title VII? Can I ask you this? Do you think that there is a tenable distinction between a mixed motives case and a non-mixed motives case? In every employment discrimination case that gets beyond summary judgment, aren't there mixed motives at play? Is there any -- is there any empirical evidence to show whether any of this really makes a difference. Have there been studies on the effect of the 1991 amendments, whether they have made a difference in the way cases actually come out? Well, in addition to that, Mr. Phillips, isn't age more closely correlated with legitimate reasons for employment discrimination than race and other factors that are proscribed by Title VII?

If an undercover police officer is in a house making drug buy, and you want to say that the single officer who is there in an undercover capacity can say, ""You guys are all under arrest.

What was the evidence that the State court -- do you say that the State court refused to consider evidence that was proffered to it? But that really does not present the question that you asked the Court to decide. Well, your argument is dependent on the proposition that the claim that was advanced in the Federal habeas proceeding is a different claim from a claim that was adjudicated on the merits in the State court? And if that's the case, I don't understand why your adversary is not correct that it will always be possible in capital cases for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim that has been adjudicated on the merits in the State court to be advanced and get de novo review in Federal habeas, where every aspect of the defendant's life that is potentially favorable can be advanced as a basis for mitigation.

Is it correct that neither of the following -- to borrow the terminology that you would use in formal litigation, and I understand this is not formal litigation before an agency, but to borrow that terminology, is it correct that the issue here doesn't concern either the burden of production or the risk of nonpersuasion before the administrative agency, before the regional office? In other words, if there's -- if there is evidence that the veteran as opposed to the VA has to produce, that doesn't change, and whatever the standard is that has to be met to show an entitlement to benefits, that doesn't change either, so that all that's involved here is whether -- whatever showing needs to be made is to be made on appeal or on remand? If the -- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt. Well, why is that -- why is it a speculative enterprise? It's -- if the -- if you are correct, and the proper resolution in a case like this is a remand, let's say all the way back to the regional office, and if before the regional office it's the veteran who will need to come forward with some evidence supporting the claim, why does it make sense to remand the case to the regional office if there is no possibility that when the case gets back there the veteran can come forward with medical evidence that's needed? What if you have the situation -- and I think actually your -- your co-Respondent's case illustrates this better than yours. But you have a situation where the record as it has developed contains some evidence that supports the -- the veteran's position, some evidence that supports the position in favor of denial of benefits. The -- the Veterans Administration, all the way up through the process, finds that the evidence contrary to the veteran's position is much stronger and denies the claim on that basis. The veteran says: I didn't get notice of what exactly I needed to prove. Now, if on remand to the regional office it's still going to be -- it's going to be up to the veteran to come forward with medical evidence showing hearing loss or vision -- connecting the vision loss to something that happened in the service, why does it make sense to send it back if there's no possibility that the veteran is going to be able to do that when the case gets back? But why doesn't it make sense in your case? I think this illustrates what is troubling to me about the Federal Circuit's decision, but maybe I am missing a point. Your client was denied benefits for failure to show a causal connection, to show that his -- his vision loss is service-related. He provided evidence from two private ophthalmologists or optometrists providing very weak causes -- evidence of causation. One said it was not inconceivable that this was the cause of it. He was examined by two VA doctors, who said it was more likely that this was caused by a post-service infection rather than by an explosion while he was in -- while he was in the service. Now, if the case -- if the notice was defective, why does it not make sense to say to your client, show us that you can come up with some medical evidence that shows that this is service-related, something more than a doctor who says it's not inconceivable? Then it makes sense to remand it. But if you can't do it on appeal, what sense does it make to remand it, where the same failure to provide evidence is going to doom his claim? Your position -- your position seems to be not that the government should have to show prejudice, but as applied to a case like yours, that there's an irrebuttable presumption of prejudice. What could the government show? That there -- they would have to show that there is not a single ophthalmologist in the country who, if he or she examined Mr. Sanders, would find that the -- that the vision loss was attributable to a bazooka explosion in World War II?

Is that -- do you think that is a fair understanding of the reason for the enactment of this? But do you -- do you think that the Congress has the power to remedy problems that are caused by the operation of the Federal prison system, caused by incarceration? What about the general proposition that if -- if the incarceration causes a problem, then the Federal Government has the power, ancillary to the power to operate the -- the criminal justice system, to remedy the problems that it has caused by the incarceration? Why as a matter of constitutional law does it end at that point? Well, what if the person is simply injured in prison as a result of, let's say, an attack by another prisoner, and now the sentence expires. The Federal Government has no power to set up hospitals or facilities to care for that person for the duration of the -- of the injury that's -- that was caused during the period of incarceration? Could you explain why the constitutional power that provides the basis for a Federal criminal conviction is exhausted at the end of the -- either the maximum term of imprisonment that Congress chooses to establish when it enacts the statute or at the end of the particular term that is given to this prisoner? I understand why it's relevant for statutory purposes. It may be relevant for other constitutional purposes -- double jeopardy and due process -- but why as a -- why does the power, the Commerce Clause power, the power to make rules for Federal property and so forth, why is that exhausted at the end of the -- either of those two periods? I don't quite understand that. Well, only to the extent that that's what the statute says. Take whatever the offense is, would it be a violation of the Necessary and Proper Clause? Let's say it's a commerce -- it's based on the Commerce Clause.

2009,Carr v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Mr. Rothfeld, I wondered if I could ask you about three interrelated points concerning your textual argument. And if I could just lay those on the table and get your reaction to them, I would appreciate it. The first is that it appears that there is a pretty universally accepted modern legislative drafting convention that statutes should be phrased in the present tense. The Senate drafting manual, for example, says: Always use the present tense unless the provision addresses only the past, the future, or a sequence of events that requires use of a different tense. And the House manual is to the same effect. The second is that when the section that's involved here, 2250, was drafted, the drafters didn't know whether SORNA would apply to pre-SORNA sex offense convictions. That was left up to the Attorney General. And so when they were drafting this, they had -- it was natural, perhaps, for them not to make a special provision for the possibility that there might be some pre-SORNA conduct involved. If the Attorney General had determined that only post-SORNA convictions would qualify, then only -- then the only travel that would qualify would be -- would be post-SORNA travel. It was only when the Attorney General decided that pre-SORNA convictions could qualify that the question that's presented here became a possibility. And the third is that once the Attorney General decided that SORNA would apply to pre-SORNA sex offense convictions, that necessarily meant that conduct constituting a -- a SORNA -- constituting a qualifying sex offense could occur in the past. And yet there are at least four provisions of SORNA that refer to the conduct that constitutes a sex offense and uses only the present tense, although in those instances it seems that those provisions have to be read as also covering past conduct, pre-SORNA conduct. These are all in 42 U.S.C. 16911, which is reproduced -- the relevant provisions are on 3a to 3-6 of the government's brief. I'll just mention a couple of them to provide a flavor for this. Under 42 U.S.C. section 16911(3)(C), on 3a of the government's brief, an offense may qualify as a tier II offense if, among other things, it, quote, ""occurs after the offender becomes a tier I sex offender. "" But there ""occurs"" and ""becomes"" have to be read as applying to past conduct. 42 U.S.C. 1691(4) on the same page says that an offense may qualify as a tier III offense if, among other things, it involves a kidnapping of a minor. But ""involves"" there has to mean also ""involved"". And the other two are subsection (7) on 5a and subsection (8) on 6a. So I wondered if you could comment on that. Maybe you have a reaction to it. I thought that the sequence argument that the government was making was that the events have to occur in this sequence: the conviction, the interstate travel, and the failure to register. Well, they might be wrong on that. And I understood that you agreed that the interstate travel has to take effect -- has to occur after the sex offense conviction. It wouldn't -- you couldn't violate -- you wouldn't violate SORNA if there's interstate travel, then the conviction, and then the failure to register. Well, but they might be wrong that the sequence -- that the way these set out -- are set out in the statute dictates a temporal sequence-- --that you can argue that the temporal sequence that's necessary -- conviction, travel, failure to register -- follows from the purpose of this provision, which is to catch people who, after having committing a sex offense and being convicted of a sex offense in State A, move to State B. It would follow from the purpose of the statute, not necessarily from the sequence of subsections in this provision. Well, that makes -- that makes a lot of sense. But you can get that from the purpose of the statute, rather than from the sequence in which these elements are listed. Is it -- is it usually the case in a criminal statute that sets out a number of element that they have to be satisfied in some kind of temporal sequence? I'm not aware of that. Well, let's compare two cases. We have this case, where you have conviction, interstate travel, SORNA takes effect, failure to register. We change that. That's case A. Case B is just like this case except the sequence is different. You have conviction, SORNA takes effect, interstate travel, failure to register. Now, why would Congress have treated those two situations differently? Isn't the concern that the State of conviction knows that an individual who has been convicted of a sex offense has been released from custody and, if that person is a resident of the State, presumably knows that the person is likely to still be in the State, but if the person moves to another State, the State to which the person moves doesn't know that a sex offender has moved into the State, and that's the reason for the Federal law that imposes a penalty for failing to register in the new State after having traveled across interstate lines? Do you happen to know what Indiana law provided at the time? Within what period of time after moving to Indiana was the Respondent required to -- rather, the Petitioner required to register? Well, should the reasonable time -- should the period under SORNA, which isn't specified by statute, be the same as the period under the law of the State into which the person moves? Right. Right. But all of those provisions refer now -- as a result of the Attorney General's determination that pre-SORNA convictions qualify, all of those provisions use the present tense to refer to activities that can have taken place in the past. This very -- this very statute. Isn't that correct? No, but your main argument is that ""travels"" is in the present tense, and that means present and future. But there are provisions of this very statute that use the present tense to refer to past conduct. So why doesn't that knock the legs out from under your textual argument? Well, Mr. Gannon may have made an argument that's not helpful to his position, but you can accept that the first provision means exactly what it says: ""is required to register"". And that takes effect on day when SORNA is enacted. There's nothing in the statute that says that those three events have to take place in -- in a temporal sequence. It doesn't say ""is required to register and thereafter travels in interstate commerce. "" It doesn't say that. In fact, an earlier version did say that, and it was taken out, wasn't it? It doesn't if that results from the aim of the statute, rather than the order in which those elements are set out in the statute. ",mr rothfeld i wonder if i could ask you about three interrelated point concern your textual argument and if i could just lay those on the table and get your reaction to them i would appreciate it the first be that it appear that there be a pretty universally accepted modern legislative drafting convention that statutes should be phrase in the present tense the senate draft manual for example say always use the present tense unless the provision address only the past the future or a sequence of event that require use of a different tense and the house manual be to the same effect the second be that when the section that be involve here be draft the drafter do not know whether sorna would apply to pre sorna sex offense conviction that be leave up to the attorney general and so when they we be draft this they have it be natural perhaps for them not to make a special provision for the possibility that there might be some pre sorna conduct involve if the attorney general have determine that only post sorna conviction would qualify then only then the only travel that would qualify would be would be post sorna travel it be only when the attorney general decide that pre sorna conviction could qualify that the question that be present here become a possibility and the third be that once the attorney general decide that sorna would apply to pre sorna sex offense conviction that necessarily mean that conduct constitute a a sorna constitute a qualify sex offense could occur in the past and yet there be at least four provision of sorna that refer to the conduct that constitute a sex offense and use only the present tense although in those instance it seem that those provision have to be read as also cover past conduct pre sorna conduct these be all in usc which

same page say that an offense may qualify as a tier iii offense if among other thing it involve a kidnapping of a minor but involves there have to mean also involved and the other two be subsection on a and subsection on a so i wonder if you could comment on that maybe you have a reaction to it i think that the sequence argument that the government be make be that the event have to occur in this sequence the conviction the interstate travel and the failure to register well they might be wrong on that and i understood that you agree that the interstate travel have to take effect have to occur after the sex offense conviction it would not you could not violate you would not violate sorna if there be interstate travel then the conviction and then the failure to register well but they might be wrong that the sequence that the way these set out be set out in the statute dictate a temporal sequence that you can argue that the temporal sequence that be necessary conviction travel failure to register follow from the purpose of this provision which be to catch people who after have commit a sex offense and be convict of a sex offense in state a move to state b it would follow from the

the sequence in which these element be list be it be it usually the case in a criminal statute that set out a number of element that they have to be satisfy in some kind of temporal sequence I be not

that the state of conviction know that an individual who have be convict of a sex offense have be release from custody and if that person be a resident of the state presumably know that the person be

2009,Pottawattamie County v. McGhee,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","When the issue, when the -- the claim is based on the evaluation of the truthfulness of a witness who eventually testifies at trial, where's the line to be drawn between the investigative stage and the prosecutorial stage? What concerns me about your argument is the -- is a real fear that it will eviscerate Imbler. Now, maybe you can convince me that it will not have that effect, but as the Solicitor General argued at the end of his argument, a very -- in the typical criminal case, the witnesses are not John Q. Public with -- who have never engaged in any wrongful activity. A typical witness is -- well, let's take the case of the prosecution of a -- a white -- of the CEO of a huge corporation for insider trading or some other white-collar violation. And the chief witness against this person is, let's say, the CFO of this company, who when initially questioned by law enforcement officials and investigatory officials, made -- made statements denying any participation in any wrongdoing, but eventually changed his story and testifies against the-- CEO at trial in exchange for consideration in a plea deal. Now, your argument, in a case like that -- or you could change the facts, make it an organized crime case, make it a prosecution of a drug kingpin who's testifying -- the witness against him is a lower-ranking person in the organization who has a criminal record, maybe has previously committed perjury, has made numerous false statements, is subject to impeachment. In all of those cases a claim could be brought against the prosecutor. Well, I mean, that might be true as an empirical matter, but I don't understand why it would be hard to allege. What would you have to allege to get by Iqbal or to get by summary judgment? You allege that the testimony at trial was false and that the prosecutor knew that it was false. And in support of that you have prior inconsistent statements by the witness, and you may have the evidence that was introduced by the defense at trial that is inconsistent with that. You have a triable issue. You certainly get by 12(b)(6). Why is it difficult to allege fabrication? The -- the allegation is that at point A this witness denied that the defendant did anything wrong, and then at point B the defendant told an entirely different story after having received from the government a plea deal that promises no prosecution and entry into the witness protection program or something like that. That certainly is sufficient evidence to -- of fabrication, is it not? That's an entirely false picture of the way any sophisticated prosecution is handled today, completely false. You want -- the prosecutor may not know whether there's probable cause until the prosecutor interviews the witness. And so then you have to go back and determine whether there was -- if there wasn't probable cause before the interview, then there is liability. But if there was probable cause before the interview, then there isn't liability. Before the re-interview, because the prosecutor doesn't want to take the case to the grand jury before looking this witness in the eye and seeing whether this -- this guy who's got a lot of impeachment baggage is -- is a -- is a credible witness. In -- in answer to Justice Breyer's question, would -- would it be a -- would it be practical and conceptually correct to draw the line at the stage at which the prosecutor is interviewing witnesses to evaluate credibility? So, at that stage, the prosecutorial function has begun and absolute immunity would kick in. Not on whether there is probable cause because probable cause is -- is evanescent. It comes, and it goes. It is -- it is -- it is inextricably intertwined with what the prosecutor is doing in questioning the witness. But with a line toward investigating credibility for use at a trial, which is -- which is, at that point, foreordained, but, if the evaluation is being done for the purpose of determining whether there should be a trial, then, no. That's your answer?

If someone owns beachfront property, they accept -- they -- they understand the risk that a hurricane may cause avulsion, a hurricane may knock down their house. Does that mean the State could come in and knock down the house and say this is an artificial avulsion? Well, what's the difference? You're taking a concept that has to do with a risk that you bear because of the -- the vagaries of -- of the weather and storms, and you're applying it to something that's done by the State. Yes, talking about a label, and putting the avulsion label and the accretion label on something that the State does, doesn't -- doesn't eliminate the fact that there's been a fundamental change. You have taken a doctrine that applies to things that occur as a result of nature and you've applied it to things that are produced by the State.

2009,Hamilton v. Lanning,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","But isn't it the case that before the 2005 amendments, bankruptcy courts were recognized as having discretion in calculating projected disposable income to take into account changes in the debtor's income after the filing of the plan, and shouldn't we presume that -- that Congress intended to continue essentially the same regime, unless Congress provided some clear indication that they wanted to depart from it? It is odd that Congress provided this very detailed formula and -- and that they would provide such a detailed formula and then say: But the bankruptcy court can modify that based on a projection. But still we have the word ""projection -- projected"". And your interpretation leads to very strange, really absurd results; isn't that true? And you have to devise some really elaborate escape strategies in order to allow a debtor to avoid those very strange results. But you say that that can be done only if the debtor fails to file a form that the debtor is required to file; isn't that right? What do you do with the situation in which the change that is projected to occur and in fact may be almost certain to occur is one that causes an increase in the debtor's income? Let's say the debtor was unemployed through almost all of the lookback period and then just before the filing of the plan gets a job with a good salary. You would say that the -- if you just look at the lookback period, the debtor would be required to pay practically nothing. What is a creditor to do in that situation? But can the -- can the plan be modified based on -- can the plan be modified based on something that was known before the plan was confirmed? Well, if it can't, then how is this modification remedy going to work? Your argument is that the Court has to confirm a plan that is really not confirmable because the debtor can't possibly make the payments under the plan, but then can turn around immediately and modify the plan so that it does call for payments to be made. Well, I thought that -- explain it, then? What do you say about cases in which moving the 6-month period can't solve the problem? For example, if the debtor had good income for many years going back, but then slight -- shortly before the filing of the plan loses his or her job, and there is no prospect that the debtor is going to get another job? Or it could be the converse, has very low income for a long period and then right before gets a job. So you are not going to be able to cure those problems by moving the 6-month period. What do you do then? Can I ask you this? There seems to be at least a subtle difference between your position and the government's position. You say that the projected disposable income will be different from the disposable income calculated during the lookback period when it is known or virtually certain that there will be differences in income or expenses. And the government says that there is a difference when something is likely to occur in the future. Where do you -- where do you get from the statute your known or virtually certain differences? But do you think bankruptcy courts are supposed to be economic forecasters? For example, if you -- after calculating the debtor's income during the 6-month period, the 6-month lookback period, should the bankruptcy court said, well -- say: Well, it's -- inflation is projected to be such-and-such over the term of this plan, so I am just going to increase it by the amount of inflation; or: This person works in a particular industry where historically, over the last five years or ten years, there's been a 3 percent increase in salary per year, so I'm going to multiply it by -- multiply the disposable income figure like that? Well, why not? You say that the bankruptcy courts should take into account things that are likely to occur in the future. What if the debtor is a waiter and during the last month of the 6-month period, because of some change of the economy the waiter's tips have gone up either way up or way down? What's the court supposed to do then? ",but be not it the case that before the amendment bankruptcy court we be recognize as have discretion in calculate project disposable income to take into account change in the debtor s income after the filing of the plan and should not we presume that that congress intend to continue essentially the same regime unless congress provide some clear indication that they want to depart from it it be odd that congress provide this very detailed formula and and that they would provide such a detailed formula and then say but the bankruptcy court can modify that base on a projection but still we have the word projection project and your interpretation lead to very strange really absurd result be not that true and you have to devise some really elaborate escape strategy in order to allow a debtor to avoid those very strange result but you say that that can be do only if the debtor fail to file a form that the debtor be require to file be not that right what do you do with the situation in which the change that be project to occur and in fact may be almost certain to occur be one that cause an increase in the debtor s income let us say the debtor be unemployed through almost all of the lookback period and then just before the filing of the plan get a job with a good salary you would say that the if you just look at the lookback period the debtor would be require to pay practically nothing what be a creditor to do in that situation but can the can the plan be modify base on can the plan be modify base on something that be know before the plan be confirm well if it can not then how be this modification remedy go to work your argument be that the court have to confirm a plan that be really not confirmable because the debtor can not possibly make the payment under the plan but then can turn around immediately and modify the plan so that it do call for payment to be make well i think that explain it then what do you say about case in which move the month period can not solve the problem for example if the debtor have good income for many year go back but then slight shortly before the filing of the plan lose his or her job and there be no prospect that the debtor be go to get another job or it could be the converse have very low income for a long period and then right before get a job so you be not go to be able to cure those problem by move the month period what do you do then can i ask you this there seem to be at least a subtle difference between your position and the government s position you say that the project disposable income will be different from the disposable income calculate during the lookback period when it be know or virtually certain that there will be difference in income or expense and the government say that there be a difference when something be likely to occur in the future where do you where do you get from the statute your known or virtually certain difference but do you think bankruptcy court be suppose to be economic forecaster for example if you after calculate the debtor s income during the month period the month lookback period should the bankruptcy court say well say well it be inflation be project to be such and such over the term of this plan so i be just go to increase it by the amount of inflation or this person work in a particular industry where historically over the last five year or ten year there be be a percent increase in salary per year so I be go to multiply it by multiply the disposable income figure like that well why not you say that the bankruptcy court should take into account thing that be likely to occur in the future what if the debtor be a waiter and during the last month of the month period because of some change of the economy the waiter s tip have go up either way up or way down what be the court suppose to do then ,251.26,Roberts Court,"Mar 22, 2010","Jan Hamilton, Chapter 13 Trustee",Stephanie Kay Lanning,08-998,"Nov 2, 2009","Jun 7, 2010",112,0.0,1.0,1.0,0
2009,United States v. Stevens,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Justice Scalia spoke about the aficionada of Spanish bullfighting. Suppose that I am an aficionado of the sort gladiatorial contests that used to take place in ancient Rome, and suppose that some -- Rome or some other place decides that it wants to make money by staging these things and selling videos of them or broadcasting them live around the world. Do you have any doubt that that could be prohibitive? A gladiatorial contests where the gladiators fight to the death. Do you have any doubt that that could be prohibited? No, no, not under this statute, under a different statute. What about crush videos, which apparently were the focus of Congress's attention when it drafted these? Now, I suppose by an analogy to what Justice Scalia just said about the message of dog fighting videos, the people who produce crush videos think they have a message, and the message is that this is -- this is sexually exciting or it's exciting in some way to see a woman in high heeled shoes crushing a little animal to death. Do you think that is constitutionally protected? You are not -- you are not even willing to say that that could be prohibited? Under a properly drawn statute-- --Might. I would really like you to tell me whether it would; whether you are willing to concede. Because we are trying to determine whether this is overly broad. And this is the category of activity that Congress particularly targeted. So to me at least it's important to know whether at least as applied to what Congress principally had in mind, the statute could -- could pass constitutional muster. If it were, you know, as applied. But in determining whether this is over -- overly broad, do we -- do we think of all of the hypotheticals that we possibly can think of that might fall within this statute: somebody hunting in the District of Columbia, somebody producing fois gras with a goose and say, ""Well, we've thought of a lot of hypothetical situations where this statute might apply and therefore it's overly broad? "" Or do we look at what's going on in the real world? So we really think of all the hypotheticals. That's how you think we determine the constitutionality of this under the overbreadth doctrine? If it's the fact that during the ten years when this statute has been in effect there has been no decrease in hunting videos and hunting shows on TV, and all of the rest -- the only perceptible change in the real world is that these -- is that the market for crush videos dried up, at least until the Third Circuit's decision, does that have any relevance? Well, isn't that -- isn't that due to changes in technology? Before people could show -- could watch videos at home, this sort of thing would -- would be very difficult. And is there -- in the real world is there a market for sketches of dog fights? People get a thrill from seeing that? Well, if that's 100 percent, then what about people who -- who like to see human sacrifices? Suppose that is legally taking place someplace in the world. I mean, people here would probably love to see it. Live, pay per view, you know, on the human sacrifice channel. [Laughter] They have a point of view they want to express. That's okay?

2009,Berghuis v. Smith,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","The statistical issue is very interesting, but I -- I wonder, if we were not looking at this through AEDPA, why we -- why a court should necessarily have to start with the question -- with the elements of the prima facie -- with the question of whether there is unconstitutional underrepresentation, when in the end, as I understand Duren, the defendant has to identify some aspect of the jury selection process that has a disproportionate impact on the group involved and is unreasonable? And unless that can be done at the outset, why struggle with these statistics? Now, here, to illustrate, the aspect of the jury selection process that the Sixth Circuit thought was unreasonable was the prior practice of choosing the jurors first for the district courts, the misdemeanor courts, rather than the circuit courts, the -- the felony courts. But the -- the trial judge, it seemed to me, address this in -- in a very thoughtful way, and he said there just isn't any proof that this old system had that effect. And it's hard for me to see how it could have that effect, unless the -- the number of jurors chosen for the district courts in Grand Rapids was disproportionate to the number chosen for the district courts in the other jurisdictions within the county. So that seems to me to be the end of the case. And why does it make sense to -- to struggle with this rather complicated statistical problem, if at the end of the day, it's going to come down to something of that nature? But concluding that it's systematic doesn't mean that the defendant wins. It just means that the State has to -- has to justify the -- the mechanism that's causing -- that's causing this -- this situation. It says that the State has to show that it has a reason, a good reason, for -- the aspect of the selection process that has been identified as causing the disparity. But does it say that it's the State's obligation to go through every factor that may cause the disparity and justify every one? Or is it the defendant's obligation to point to some aspect of the selection -- of the -- of the system that causes the disparity? Then once the defendant identifies that, then the State can show if it -- can try to show that there's a good reason for it. But that's the only factor that the Sixth Circuit identified as illegitimate, was this -- was this siphoning system. It rejected everything else, didn't it? Are there -- are there courts that you know of that do what you are suggesting needs to be done? When a juror does not show up, the judge issues a bench warrant, and -- and the police are sent out to arrest the person and drag the person into court, or somebody says, I am a single parent, and I have children, and I'm too poor to have a nanny or an au pair, and, therefore, please excuse me; and they say, no, you have to find some way of getting here. Are there courts that do that? Isn't that the case-- --If -- if Grand -- if Grand Rapids uses a disproportionate number of jurors in its district courts, then you are going to have this problem -- the only way to fix the problem would be to have a separate jury system for the district courts. If you have the -- the circuit courts going first, then the people in the district courts are going to have the problem that you identify. If you have a system in which it's all done randomly -- circuit court, district court -- the people who come toward the end are going to have the problem. So I don't see any way out of this, if in fact there was a statistical basis for it, other than having a separate selection process for the district courts. Is that what you think is necessary? ",the statistical issue be very interesting but i i wonder if we we be not look at this through aedpa why we why a court should necessarily have to start with the question with the element of the prima facie with the question of whether there be unconstitutional underrepresentation when in the end as i understand duren the defendant have to identify some aspect of the jury selection process that have a disproportionate impact on the group involve and be unreasonable and unless that can be do at the outset why struggle with these statistic now here to illustrate the aspect of the jury selection process that the sixth circuit thought be unreasonable be the prior practice of choose the juror first for the district court the misdemeanor court rather than the circuit court the the felony court but the the trial judge it seem to me address this in in a very thoughtful way and he say there just be not any proof that this old system have that effect and it be hard for me to see how it could have that effect unless the the number of juror choose for the district court in grand rapid be disproportionate to the number choose for the district court in the other jurisdiction within the county so that seem to me to be the end of the case and why do it make sense to to struggle with this rather complicate statistical problem if at the end of the day it be go to come down to something of that nature but conclude that it be systematic do not mean that the defendant win it just mean that the state have to have to justify the the mechanism that have causing that be cause this this situation it say that the state have to show that it have a reason a good reason for the aspect of the selection process that have be identify as cause the disparity but do it say that it be the state s obligation to go through every factor that may because the disparity and justify every one or be it the defendant s obligation to point to some aspect of the selection of the of the system that cause the disparity then once the defendant identify that then the state can show if it can try to show that there be a good reason for it but that be the only factor that the sixth circuit identify as illegitimate be this be this siphoning system it reject everything else do not it be there be there court that you know of that do what you be suggest need to be do when a juror do not show up the judge issue a bench warrant and and the police be send out to arrest the person and drag the person into court or somebody say i be a single parent and i have child and I be too poor to have a nanny or an au pair and therefore please excuse me and they say no you have to find some way of get here be there court that do that be not that the case if if grand if grand rapid use a disproportionate number of juror in its district court then you be go to have this problem the only way to fix the problem would be to have a separate jury system for the district court if you have the the circuit court go first then the people in the district court be go to have the problem that you identify if you have a system in which it be all do randomly circuit court district court the people who come toward the end be go to have the problem so i do not see any way out of this if in fact there be a statistical basis for it other than have a separate selection process for the district court be that what you think be necessary ,231.45,Roberts Court,"Jan 20, 2010","Mary Berghuis, Warden",Diapolis Smith,08-1402,"Sep 30, 2009","Mar 30, 2010",112,1.0,1.0,0.0,1

Now, that doesn't make it a felony for these purposes, right? All right. But in sentencing the -- the defendant in State court for this felony, the -- the defendant concedes that he had a prior conviction, and the judge finds that and takes that into account in imposing the sentence.

What is the difference between that and -- and a situation where, just because of the vagary of State law, recidivism is something that has to be proven in order to bring the offense into the -- into the felony level? That seems to be a totally formalistic distinction that's based on the vagaries of State law. What -- what is the difference between someone who is found by a court under a State recidivism provision to have -- to be eligible for an increased punishment as a result of that finding and someone who is found by a court in the context of sentencing, discretionary sentencing, to have a felony possession, to have a prior -- a prior conviction and receives an increased sentence as a result of that? What is the -- is there any functional difference between those two situations? But does it matter in that situation that that's an element, that has to be an element of the offense?

Now, that is a, a (d)(1) argument, 2254(d)(1). But the two questions on which cert were granted have to do with findings of fact. So they have to do with (d)(2) and (e)(1) and not (d)(1) at all. But that's an entirely different question. I think that's the question. Did the validity of the -- the conclusion made by the State courts that there was a strategic decision not to present this evidence until the -- the final judge stage of the -- of the proceeding, and not whether there was a reasonable investigation or whether they -- there was reasonable performance overall at the penalty phase. It's purely this question of the validity of a finding of historical fact and how that is to be evaluated under -- under (d), under (d)(2) and (e)(1). Well, let me give you an example involving exactly those two provisions and facts very similar to the facts here. The State court finds that a strategic decision was made, and that raises a question under (d)(2): Was the State court's rejection of the Strickland claim the result of a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding? There are also a host of subsidiary findings of historical fact because the attorneys testify and documents are produced, and there are conflicts in the testimony. And so there's a question of did -- did Dozier and Ralph talk about this on a particular day? Did Trotter write a letter to so-and-so? And so forth. So you've got all these subsidiary -- all these findings of historical fact, and they are to be reviewed under (e)(1), under the plain language of (e)(1). And then after they're reviewed under the plain language of (e)(1), you turn to the question under (d)(2), which is whether the decision about whether there was a strategic decision was based on -- based on an unreasonable determination of facts.

There is nothing in the file. How are those cases going to be handled? Isn't it different in that the ordinary Strickland claim concerns things that happen at trial and relate to strategy in a criminal case, as to which the public defender or other defense attorney presumably has expertise? But what's the answer to this question: The defendant takes the stand and says: My attorney said that, don't worry about it, you are not going to get removed. And the lawyer says: Well, here's my file; I have nothing in this whatsoever about having said anything about removal and I can't remember the particulars of every single conversation I had with this attorney 5 -- with this client, 5 years ago.

And the lawyer says, well, immigration law is very complicated and I'm not an expert on this and I'm not going to tell you. And so the client says -- and the lawyer says, if you want to know about that you've got to get a deportation -- you have got to get an immigration lawyer. And the alien defendant says: Well, I have no money; that's why you were appointed to represent me. How am I going to get advice on the immigration law issue? And the lawyer says: Well, that's just too bad for you. And that's the line you want us to draw? What about the situation where the attorney says nothing about -- I mean, removal is -- is out there as -- as a real possibility, but it just doesn't occur to the -- the defendant and the attorney doesn't even mention, you know, you might -- you might want to think about the removal consequences of this? What about the situation where the -- the defendant would have made sacrifices and obtained competent immigration advice, were it not for affirmative misrepresentations by criminal defense -- by criminal defense attorneys? The criminal defense attorney says don't worry about it, you are not going to be removed. And the defendant says, you really sure about that? Because if you are not, you know, my relatives are getting a second mortgage on the house and we are going to go hire an immigration lawyer so we can be absolutely sure about that -- this. And the criminal attorney says I'm an expert on this, I've just had -- you know, six hours of CLE on immigration law, and in reliance on that faulty advice the defendant pleads guilty and finds himself facing removal. Well, just to be-- --Just to be clear about the scope of your argument -- maybe you could just clarify. Which, if any of the following, would you not put in the same category as advice about immigration consequences: Advice about consequences for a conviction for a sex offense, the loss of professional licensing or future employment opportunities, civil liability, tax liability, right to vote, right to bear arms. Are they all in the same category? Or do you -- do you draw a line some place? ",why would it be limit to a decision to plead guilty what if a decision to plead guilty would have less immigration consequence than a guilty verdict after after go to trial would not you have the same situation there well what if what if an offer be make for a plea to an offense that would have less immigration consequence than the offense for which the person might be convict if the person go to trial and the and the attorney do not fully apprise the client of the situation right but do you see a difference in principle between the two situation with respect to the issue that be before us here your argument have have an appeal because removal be such a harsh consequence particularly for someone like your client who have be in the united state for a long time but what trouble me about it be the situation in which the defendant claim let us say year after enter a guilty plea or after the passage of some time that mis advice be give and the attorney on the other side be a busy public defender who by that time have handle case and be unable to remember what if anything be say about the immigration consequence of the case there be nothing in the file how be those case go to be handle be not it different in that the ordinary strickland claim concern thing that happen at trial and relate to strategy in a criminal case as to which the public defender or other defense attorney presumably have expertise but what be the answer to this question the defendant take the stand and say my attorney say that do not worry about it you be not go to get remove and the lawyer say well here s my file i have nothing in this whatsoever about have say anything about removal and i can not remember the particular of every single conversation i have with this attorney with this client year ago but what be you go to do in a situation where the defendant be concern about removal the removal consequence and this be let us say this be a case out in some rural jurisdiction you have get a public defender or a retained attorney and the the the attorney be you know provide advice base on the criminal law consequence and the client say well I be also concern about the immigration consequence and the lawyer say well immigration law be very complicated and I be not an expert on this and I be not go to tell you and so the client say and the lawyer say if you want to know about that you have get to get a deportation you have get to get an immigration lawyer and the alien defendant say well i have no money that be why you we be appoint to represent me how be i go to get advice on the immigration law issue and the lawyer say well that be just too bad for you and that be the line you want us to draw what about the situation where the attorney say nothing about i mean removal be be out there as as a real possibility but it just do not occur to the the defendant and the attorney do not even mention you know you might you might want to think about the removal consequence of this what about the situation where the the defendant would have make sacrifice and obtain competent immigration advice we be it not for affirmative misrepresentation by criminal defense by criminal defense attorney the criminal defense attorney say do not worry about it you be not go to be remove and the defendant say you really sure about that because if you be not you know my relative be get a second mortgage on the house and we be go to go hire an immigration lawyer so we can be absolutely sure about that this and the criminal attorney say I be an expert on this I have just have you know six hour of cle on immigration law and in reliance on that faulty advice the defendant plead guilty and find himself face removal well just to be just to be clear about the scope of your argument maybe you could just clarify which if any of the following would you not put in the same category as advice about immigration consequence advice about consequence for a conviction for a sex offense the loss of professional licensing or future employment opportunity civil liability tax liability right to vote right to bear arm be they all in the same category or do you do you draw a line some place ,282.11999999999995,Roberts Court,"Oct 13, 2009",Jose Padilla,Kentucky,08-651,"Feb 23, 2009","Mar 31, 2010",112,1.0,1.0,1.0,1

2009,Lewis v. Chicago,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Your position may -- may follow from the language of Title VII, but you began by saying that it also represents the best policy. And I wonder if you could explain why that is so. Here, the City of Chicago continued to use this test for quite a number of years after it was administered. And so as you interpret the statute, I gather that someone could still file a disparate impact claim 6 or 7 years after the test was first administered, and quite a few years after it was first used in making a hiring decision. And how can that be squared with Congress's evident desire in Title VII to require that an EEOC charge be filed rather promptly after the employment action is taken? Why would Congress have wanted to allow a question like this to be left open for such an extended period of time? Why would it not have wanted everybody who is potentially affected by it to understand where things stand at a much earlier point, at some reasonable period of time after all of the information is in the -- in the possession of a potential plaintiff to determine whether there has been a disparate impact and whether that -- that person is going to be adversely affected by it, particularly if at a later point the effect of a remedial decree can be to upset the employment -- the employment status of other people who have been hired in the interim? Well, somebody getting -- someone getting a letter that you sent to people who were qualified didn't know that. The only thing that I see that you sent to the people who fell into the qualified category was that it was unlikely, which I take it means less than 50 percent, that they would be called for further processing, but it was possible that they would be called for further processing. You didn't tell them anything about -- you didn't tell them that you were going to fill all of your available positions with people who were classified as well qualified in that letter-- --did you? Right. That's right. Well, why did the City say that it was planning to give a new test in 3 years and then wait more than a decade before giving a new test? If I received one of these qualified letters, and I also -- and I knew in addition that the City was going to give a test in 3 years, that might well affect my incentive about bringing a lawsuit to challenge this. But you don't challenge that. You don't challenge that. You now acknowledge that the Plaintiffs were treated unlawfully. And were you prejudiced by the delay in the filing of the EEOC charge?

But, well -- well, with respect, even if the Constitution permits this, if the parties understood the plea agreement to mean that this was going to be barred, then why isn't that the end of the matter? And I suppose the argument could be that the -- that the government has no authority under D.C. law to enter into such an agreement, as well require these two-- Can I ask you this: The District of Columbia Court of Appeals said we are satisfied that no objectively reasonable person could understand that Mr. Robertson's plea agreement bound Ms. Watson and precluded her contempt proceeding against Mr. Robertson.

Just so I understand what is before us, you preserve -- you saying -- you are saying you preserve the issue that even if your client fully understood that this plea agreement had no application to a criminal contempt proceeding, he preserved the argument that he could contest the criminal contempt proceeding on the ground that it would be unconstitutional? No, I understand that. I understand there's the contract issue. But did you -- in the lower court, did you argue even if he gave that up, under the plea agreement, the criminal contempt proceeding still could not be brought?

2009,Graham v. Florida,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","You're making a-- --And you are making a per se argument, no? You can imagine someone who is a month short of his 18th birthday, and you are saying that, no matter what this person does, commits the most horrible series of non-homicide offenses that you can imagine, a whole series of brutal rapes, assaults that render the -- the victim paraplegic but not dead, no matter what, the person is sentenced shows no remorse whatsoever, the worst case you can possibly imagine, cannot -- that person must at some point be made eligible for parole. That's your argument? If we agree with you-- --If we agree with you, at what point must the parole consideration be given? There is a suggestion in your brief that maybe the Colorado statute, which says that a person can get parole consideration after 40 years, would be constitutional. Is that your position? But Florida has abolished parole, has it not, going forward? So eventually, if things are allowed to take their course, the Florida parole board will go out of business. And why isn't the -- the most sensible way to deal with the problem that you are raising, the one that the Chief Justice suggested, to permit as-applied proportionality challenges that take into account the particular circumstances of the juvenile in question, rather than this per se rule that you are advocating, which would deprive the State of Florida from reaching the judgment that there are some -- there are some juveniles, some individuals who are short of their 18th birthday, who cannot -- who deserve imprisonment in -- life imprisonment without parole? Some of the actual cases that -- in which this sentence has been imposed in Florida involve factual situations that are so horrible that I couldn't have imagined them if I hadn't actually seen them. Raping an 8-year-old girl and burying her alive. Are you familiar with that case? Raping a woman in front of her 12-year-old son and then forcing the son to engage in sexual conduct with the mother. Are you familiar with that case? But do you know anybody who is willing to say that, as a categorical matter, that -- you know, the 18th birthday is the magical date for every single person? Because the Court, up to this point, has said that death is different, and the rules -- the Eighth Amendment rules in capital cases are entirely different from the Eighth Amendment rules in -- in all other cases. If we -- you know, if we abandon that, then one of two things has to happen, either the rules for noncapital cases have to change dramatically, or the rules for capital cases have to change dramatically, unless death is different, in fact. I know you are not asking for that, but that -- isn't that where this, logically, is going? If death is not different, then there should be uniform rules across the board. Why does it say that? Why doesn't it just say that, in this particular case, what this individual has done is so bad that, even if this person can be rehabilitated and would not present a danger to -- to society at age 60 or 70, that this person is -- should be sentenced to life without parole? That's -- that's what it means for an adult offender.

2009,Christian Legal Society Chapter v. Martinez,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Mr. McConnell, when I read -- when I read the papers that Hastings submitted to the district court at the same time that the joint stipulation was submitted, I saw one reference after another to an allegation that Hastings was applying its policy in a discriminatory manner, that it was not in fact insisting that all registered student organizations admit all applicants. And when I read their brief in the Ninth Circuit, I saw that point reiterated again and again. So that led me to believe that what was stipulated was not that in fact they had a policy which they enforced under which anybody who applied to any group would be admitted, but that this was what Dean Kane had announced. That was the stated policy, but not necessarily the actual policy that was employed. And that was the argument it seemed to me that CLS was making; isn't that correct? And was there any written document memorializing this policy prior to the time when the former dean gave her deposition? And is the -- is the policy as articulated by the dean in her deposition the same as the policy that Hastings now claims it has in its brief? Do you think this case deserved a two-sentence decision in the Ninth Circuit? So the answer is yes, this case which is -- before us has produced hundreds and hundreds of pages of amicus briefs, deserved two sentences in the court of appeals? But hasn't it been -- hasn't it been CLS's position from the very beginning of this case that Hastings has not in fact required every group to admit any student who applies? Don't they say that over and over again in their district court papers, in the court of appeals briefs, and in the cert petition? But you now say-- --You now say in your brief that it is okay for a group to impose membership requirements that are neutral and not based on beliefs. Isn't that right? Well, let's explore-- --Let's explore the implications of this policy. Suppose at a particular campus there is a great deal of anti-Muslim animus. And there's a small Muslim group; it has 10 students. If the group is required to accept anybody who applies for membership, and 50 students who hate Muslims show up and they want to take over that group, you say the First Amendment allows that? Well, CLS obviously thinks this is a real threat. Now, what do you propose that they do? Suppose that you win this case, and then when the case -- and then when this all-applicants policy is administered, then precisely what they fear begins to take place. Do they have any recourse? No, do they have any-- --Do they have any recourse? If they have 10 members, and 8 who are completely hostile to the organization sign up? I understand the answer to that question. So, if -- if hostile members take over CLS, the former members of CLS can form CLS II? [Laughter] If an orthodox-- --If an orthodox Jewish group or a Muslim group applied for recognition and the group said part of our beliefs is -- one of our beliefs is that men and women should sit separately at religious services, would Hastings deny registration to that group? We have -- we have two amicus briefs from orthodox Jewish groups and a brief from a Muslim group. So, your answer is that they could not be recognized under Hastings' policy because of their religious beliefs regarding the way religious services should be conducted? As I understood the position, your latest position in your brief, you really don't say you have an all-comers policy. There are certain criteria that can be applied, like interest, knowledge; is that correct? Could a -- well, could a group, consistent with your revised all-comers policy, require that members who want -- anyone who wants to become a member show a particular level of knowledge about the subject of the group? So if the CLS required anybody who wanted to become a member to pass a test on the Bible, that would be okay? If the school adopt an all-comers policy-- --for the purpose-- --Well, could I just ask one quick question relating to that? If -- if an all-comers policy is adopted for the purpose of discriminating on the basis of viewpoint, does it violate the First Amendment?

2009,Maryland v. Shatzer,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, couldn't we say that in -- in the situation where there is a change from pretrial status to post-conviction status, the Edwards rule is no longer an irrebuttable presumption, but it's simply a rebuttable presumption? And that there -- that the rule would not apply if the prosecution could show that under the circumstances the reason for the rule, the concern about law enforcement badgering, was not present? If the change-- This is an area where it is very difficult to draw lines, at least I find it difficult to draw lines. So let me start you out with an extreme hypothetical, and I would like you tell me whether you think the Edwards rule reaches this far. And if it doesn't, then I would like you to tell me why it doesn't. And what limitations, if any, on the rule you would be willing to defend as consistent with the rationale for the rule. Someone is taken into custody in Maryland in 1999 and questioned for joy riding, released from custody, and then in 2009 is taken into custody and questioned for murder in Montana. Now, at the time of the first questioning, the -- the suspect invokes the Fifth Amendment right to counsel. Now, does the Edwards rule apply to the second interrogation? And you don't think that's a ridiculous application of the rule? First of all, how are the authorities in Montana possibly going to know whether this person was interrogated previously on a crime for which the person was never convicted in Maryland, and that invoked the right not to be questioned without -- without an attorney? And you think there is badgering in that situation? So all right, they run the rap sheet and they find out, if they do, that the person was arrested ten years earlier in Maryland and then what? They try to find the detective that questioned the -- the suspect in 1999 in Maryland? And they find out that the detective is retired and is now, you know, fishing down in the Florida Keys, and they have to track this person down and say, now do you recall whether this person -- that's the rule you are arguing for? Let me pose you my hypothetical again, the same joy riding questioning, and then 40 years later after the person has gotten a law degree and become an entrepreneur and made $20 million, he's taken into custody and questioned by the Federal authorities for stock fraud. Forever, you know, this right that was invoked back in adolescence continues forever. Why is there a greater risk of badgering when the questioning is about a different offense? I thought you just said we could -- you were suggesting an -- as an alternative, that -- that Edwards be limited to situations where the questioning is about the same offense. I mean, this isn't fanciful. We just were asked to take a case involving a statute of limitations issue for a murder that was committed like 30 years ago, and it said suppose somebody is questioned by State authorities for a murder and taken into custody and then released and then, 30 years later, taken into custody by Federal authorities and questioned for a civil rights violation, based on the same underlying transaction. You would say the Edwards rule applies in that situation? I can think of -- I can think of at least one situation in which the Court has held that there is a time limit in which something has to be done in order to comply with a Constitutional requirement. If we were to choose a time period here, what would -- what would you propose? What would be-- --What would be a serious -- what would be a serious answer to that question? All or nothing. ",well could not we say that in in the situation where there be a change from pretrial status to post conviction status the edward rule be no longer an irrebuttable presumption but it be simply a rebuttable presumption and that there that the rule would not apply if the prosecution could show that under the circumstance the reason for the rule the concern about law enforcement badgering be not present if the change this be an area where it be very difficult to draw line at least i find it difficult to draw line so let me start you out with an extreme hypothetical and i would like you tell me whether you think the edward rule reach this far and if it do not then i would like you to tell me why it do not and what limitation if any on the rule you would be willing to defend as consistent with the rationale for the rule someone be take into custody in maryland in and question for joy riding release from custody and then in be take into custody and question for murder in montana now at the time of the first questioning the the suspect invoke the fifth amendment right to counsel now do the edward rule apply to the second interrogation and you do not think that be a ridiculous application of the rule first of all how be the authority in montana possibly go to know whether this person be interrogate previously on a crime for which the person be never convict in maryland and that invoke the right not to be question without without an attorney and you think there be badger in that situation so all right they run the rap sheet and they find out if they do that the person be arrest ten year earlier in maryland and then what they try to find the detective that question the the suspect in in maryland and they find out that the detective be retire and be now you know fish down in the florida key and they have to track this person down and say now do you recall whether this person that be the rule you be argue for let me pose you my hypothetical again the same joy rid questioning and then year later after the person have get a law degree and become an entrepreneur and make million he be take into custody and question by the federal authority for stock fraud forever you know this right that be invoke back in adolescence continue forever why be there a great risk of badger when the questioning be about a different offense i think you just say we could you we be suggest an as an alternative that that edwards be limit to situation where the questioning be about the same offense i mean this be not fanciful we just we be ask to take a case involve a statute of limitation issue for a murder that be commit like year ago and it say suppose somebody be question by state authority for a murder and take into custody and then release and then year later take into custody by federal authority and question for a civil right violation base on the same underlying transaction you would say the edward rule applies in that situation i can think of i can think of at least one situation in which the court have hold that there be a time limit in which something have to be do in order to comply with a constitutional requirement if we we be to choose a time period here what would what would you propose what would be what would be a serious what would be a serious answer to that question all or nothing ,246.19,Roberts Court,"Oct 5, 2009",Maryland,"Michael Blaine Shatzer, Sr.",08-680,"Jan 26, 2009","Feb 24, 2010",112,1.0,1.0,0.0,1

If all the prosecution does is call the analyst on the stand and admit -- have the analyst provide a foundation for the admission of the report, let's say, pursuant to the hearsay exception for recorded recollection, and does nothing more, would there be a Confrontation Clause problem? What's the difference between that situation and the situation in which the report is -- is admitted, subject to -- and the analyst is available, and the defense can question the analyst if the defense wishes to? How can you say that? We have an amicus brief from 26 States plus the District of Columbia arguing exactly the contrary. They say that there is a very substantial category of cases in which defendants really have no interest whatsoever in contesting either the nature or the quantity of drugs involved, but they will refuse to stipulate to those things simply for the purpose of putting a financial burden on the prosecution, because they know, if they do that, it may be helpful for them in getting a better plea bargain, plus there is a certain risk that the analyst will not show up, and they will get the benefit of that. If this is not a burden on these 26 States plus the District of Columbia, why are they bothering to make this argument? Just for amusement? Well, does that square with where we started out? We have situation A, where the prosecutor calls the lab analyst, and the lab analyst says, this is my report, and I stand by it, period. Now, it's up to the defense to cross-examine.

Does that -- are those -- does that capture it or is there something more? Well, suppose if this -- you have the dormant Commerce Clause claim and it doesn't require a complicated analysis of State law. You have different rates of taxation, let's say, for two different categories of entities, and it's really not a very important tax credit, so pulling the thread isn't going to have much effect. And this case -- then the case would come out differently? Comity would not bar that action? May I come back to your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question?

The point is that -- that one possible -- if there was an Establishment Clause violation, one remedy would be to prohibit credits for payments made to religiously affiliated schools, but allow the credits for other private schools. But under principles of severability, couldn't an Arizona court say that can't be severed from -- from allowing the credits for payments to secular private schools?

And the other is: That I want the value of my equipment, and it just so happens to total exactly to the dollar the amount that I'm entitled to by law. Am I correct that those are the two possible readings of that? And the question is which of those is the more plausible reading? Well, when she put down the figure $10,718 on page 58a of the Joint Appendix, what did she mean by that? Yes. She meant that that was-- --She had -- she had figured out the value of the property, and her estimation of its fair market value was $10,718? It wasn't $10,717? It wasn't $10,719? It was $10,718?

2009,Doe #1 v. Reed,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, Mr. Bopp, if a voter -- if the legislature passes a statute and someone is -- is satisfied with that statute, how likely is it that that person is going to sign a petition to have a referendum to see whether the statute should be blocked? It's possible-- --but if you were in the real world, if you were to poll the people who sign a referendum petition with respect to a statute that was passed by the State legislature, what percentage do you think would be opposed to that legislation? Well, to follow up on Justice Sotomayor's question, do you think an agency could say, if you want to comment on proposed -- on a proposed rule, you have to disclose to us your name and your address and your telephone number and your political affiliation, and all sorts of -- your marital status and your income level and all sorts of other demographic information? Could they do that? --in the last questions-- --Well, I'd like to know how far you -- you are -- you want to go. You say in your brief that the availability of the referendum signature petitions allows Washington voters to engage in discussion of referred measures with persons whose acts secured the election and suspension of State law. So would -- would it be consistent with the First Amendment to require anybody who signs a petition to put down not just the person's name and address, but also telephone number, so that they could be engaged in a conversation about what they had done? I thought that you were saying that one of the interests that's served by this is to allow people who -- to allow Washington citizens to discuss this matter with those who signed the petition. So putting down the telephone number would assist them in doing that. So you would-- --You would endorse that? No, I'm not asking the policy question. I'm asking whether the First Amendment would permit that. Now, one of your Co-Respondents says that supplying this information provides insight whether support comes predominantly from members of particular political or religious organizations. Would it be consistent with the First Amendment to require anybody who signs a petition to list the person's religion? Well, let's say somebody is thinking of circulating a petition on a sensitive subject and fears that people may be dissuaded from signing because they fear retaliation. At what point could they bring this as-applied challenge? Do they have to -- could they do it before they even begin to circulate the petition, arguing that if -- if these names -- if people are not assured ahead of time that their name and address is not going to be revealed to the public on the Internet, they're not going to sign this? And how would they-- --How would they prove that there's -- that there's a -- a threat, a sufficient threat of harassment in that particular case, before the petition is even signed? Well, the -- the hypothetical is that before this petition is circulated, the supporters came into court, and they said: Look what has happened in California with -- with Proposition 8. Don't disclose -- enter an order prohibiting the public disclosure of the names and addresses here. Would that be sufficient? Can I ask you this question? It seems to me your -- the strongest State interest here is detecting fraud. And you mentioned that the records are digitized. And maybe you can correct my impression of this, but it seems to me that if the records are digitized, there are very simple ways of detecting fraud that would not require the disclosure of the list to the public. If somebody wants to see whether his or her name has been fraudulently put on the list, wouldn't it be very simple to set up a Web site where the person could put in a little bit of identifying information and see whether that person's name is on the list? And if the -- the purpose is to see whether a particular person lives at a particular address, couldn't you just cross-reference by means of a computer program the information on the referendum with the -- with the voting lists? So if you've got John Jones who lives at 10 Main Street, you see whether there really is a registered voter John Jones who lives at 10 Main Street? Why does this all have to be put out on the Internet? Well, what's the answer to my question? Couldn't you -- couldn't this be done very simply? If I want to see whether somebody has fraudulently signed my name, very quickly go to a Web site, wouldn't be expensive to set up, put in your voter ID number, and see whether -- and your name, and see whether you're on the -- on the-- --whether you -- somebody signed your name to the petition? Well, what is the -- to finish your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question, what is the non-speech component of signing a petition? And what's the State's interest in regulating the non-speech component? When you -- when you talk about the vote cast by an elected representative, of course, there's a strong interest in knowing how an elected representative voted, because the representative is answerable to the voters. But somebody who signs a petition isn't answerable to anybody -- any other citizen. So what's your interest? It's the fraud interest? Well, but how far does that go? When I asked whether you could -- you want to know the religion of the people who signed, no, you can't do that. How much more demographic information could be -- could be -- does the -- does the State of Washington have an interest in making publicly available about the people who support this election? Let's say it's -- it's a referendum about immigration. Does the State of Washington have an interest in providing information to somebody who says I want to know how many people with Hispanic names signed this, or how many people with Asian names signed this? Is that -- that what you want to facilitate? Then I don't understand what information is being -- what information you think you're providing to the public. Outside of the fraud area, if I see that John Jones from Seattle signed this petition, that tells me absolutely nothing. You know, if somebody called your office and said I'd like the -- the home address of all the attorneys who work in the Attorney General's Office because we want to -- we want to go to their homes and have uncomfortable conversations with them-- [Laughter] --which is what has been alleged here, would you release that information?

2009,Magwood v. Patterson,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","2244 doesn't make any reference to judgment, 2244(b). And now you bring in the concept of a judgment by looking at another provision. But if 8 of your brief can be correct; namely, that when a prisoner such as Petitioner obtains habeas relief from his sentence but not his conviction, any habeas petition after his resentencing that challenged his conviction would be successive. You suggest that there are two judgments; there is a judgment of sentence and there is a judgment of conviction. But for habeas purposes, the only thing that is relevant is the judgment pursuant to which the Petitioner is held in custody. And that is the judgment -- that is the sentence. So I -- I -- if your argument is correct that you look to whether there's a second or successive application as to a judgment, then the point you make in footnote 8 just cannot be true. So that if Petitioner gets sentencing relief, gets resentenced, in the second petition the Petitioner can challenge the conviction. I understand that. Well, if a -- if someone has a -- a judgment of conviction, but is no longer in custody, that -- that person cannot bring habeas petition, isn't that right? So it -- it is the judgment pursuant to which the person then is held in custody to which the habeas petition goes. Well, I don't want to belabor-- --I don't want to belabor this point, but once you get beyond the formal argument that you just look to whether it's a new judgment -- if you -- if you take a step beyond that, and if you -- if you don't take a step beyond that, then footnote 8 is wrong.

But that's what you're asking us to do. I understand you are saying that -- that there cannot be a conviction without the violation of some duty. But if we agree with that, then we are going down the road of deciding what sort of duty suffices, and does it have to be a duty that is backed up by a State criminal sanction?

There is a well-established practice on the court of appeals that when a three-judge panel for some reason loses one of the members due to a death or resignation or recusal, the panel can continue to decide the case if the remaining two judges can agree. And -- and do you see -- do you think the -- the situation is different with the NLRB for some reason? Or do you think that that -- that those decisions on the courts of appeals are unlawful as well? I was surprised by your answer to -- I was surprised by your answer to one of the earlier questions, because one of your amici says that any member of the board, regardless of whether he or she sits on the panel hearing a case, may request that the case be heard by all five board members. Is that -- is that not correct? The amicus says that the members of the board not serving on a panel are given the opportunity to review draft decisions, thus no case will issue unless it reflects the majority opinion of the full board. So that can be, in effect, the opportunity for full board review before a draft decision is issued in final form; is that the way it works? But it provides an opportunity for them to vote to hear the case en banc before it's ever issued. It begs the question-- --But hasn't the situation that has prevailed now for some time changed the -- the decision-making process of the board in at least two important ways? First, there isn't any opportunity for full board review of cases. But more important, if you have only two members on the board and only two members on the panel, the process is very different from a panel in which there were three members, or in which two members can be supplemented with an additional member if they can't agree.

2009,Barber v. Thomas,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","But why isn't the term of imprisonment most reasonably understood to mean the term that is imposed viewed at the time when it is imposed? So that if someone is sentenced to a term of 360 days, 5 years, and begins serving his sentence on January 1st, year 1 of the term imposed ends on December 31st of that year; year 2 of the term imposed begins on January 1st of the following year, and so forth. Right. Well, hang on. I understand what you are arguing, but I don't understand why the term of imprisonment changes. We look at the -- we look at the term of the imprisonment on the day when it is imposed and the day when the defendant begins serving the sentence, and you can say: Year one ends at the end of 2010; year two ends at the end of 2011. Why do you think that the term -- the phrase ""term of imprisonment"" has to change as -- the understanding of the ""term of imprisonment"" has to change as the prisoner progresses in serving the sentence? I totally fail to understand that. But you don't know whether that -- you don't know whether that prisoner is going to be eligible for the 54 days until the 365 days are over. Well, I'm not sure where you get that -- I'm not sure where you get that out of the statute. But I still don't think you have answered my question. I don't want to belabor it too much. On the day when the prisoner in my hypothetical begins serving his sentence, if you said, When will your first year of imprisonment -- first year of your term of imprisonment end? You would say December 31st, 2010. When will the second year of the term of imprisonment end? December 31st, 2011. That's what you would have to say at that point, because you don't know whether the prisoner will earn any good time credits. So why do you think that the meaning of the year of the term of imprisonment changes as the sentence goes on? No, not at all. No. At the end of -- at the end of 2010, in my hypothetical, you would take the 54 days off the end, just as Justice Sotomayor suggested. And -- but it doesn't mean that the service doesn't -- your -- your argument is predicated on the idea that service of year two begins on the 311th day. But I don't understand that. I will not belabor it. I don't understand why the parties have spent so much time sparring over that issue, which seems to me to be totally unnecessary and irrelevant. Well, the statute says that it is -- the credit, it can be received, quote, at the end of each year of the prisoner's term of imprisonment beginning at the end of the first year of the term. Now, when does -- when is that point, in your opinion? Okay. So the -- day 365 is the end of the first year of -- of the term of imprisonment? The statute says that they -- that the prisoner may receive credit at the end of each year of the prisoner's term of imprisonment beginning at the end of the first year of the term. And what I'm asking is, when is the end of the first year of the term within the meaning of that language? Is it day 3-- --Is it day 365, or is it day 311? Well, I didn't understand them to be saying that.

Well, my question -- why, then, did Congress allow 2 years after that? At that point, the plaintiff has everything that's necessary to file a complaint. So why does the plaintiff need 2 years after that point? Was there also a substantial support in the lower court case law prior to the enactment of this provision for the existence of inquiry notice? And is that therefore also incorporated into this? But, under your position, as -- the concept of inquiry notice becomes essentially very unimportant, if not completely meaningless.

When this injunction was first entered the statute -- nobody contemplated that this statute was going to be enacted; isn't that correct? Yes. So isn't the sensible interpretation of the injunction that it was prohibiting the government from permitting the display of the cross on government property, and not on private property that happens to be within the Mojave National Preserve? Wasn't your argument that this was a violation of the Establishment Clause because it was on government land? Did you make the argument that even if this was on one of the ranches within the Mojave National Preserve, it would still be a violation of the Establishment Clause? Yes, it was a totally -- so the situation completely changed and the district court either modified the injunction -- it seems to me modified the injunction by interpreting it to mean something quite different from what anybody contemplated it meant when it was originally entered? When the Solicitor General represents to us that the VFW will be perfectly free to modify this memorial in any way it chooses if they obtain title to this land, do you think that there's any realistic fear that they will be required to maintain this cross, even if they wish to -- to change it in some way? Well, I thought your argument was that although there was going to be a formal transfer of title, as a practical matter, the government was still involved with the maintenance of the cross on this land. And when the government says that that's not the case, I don't know why that doesn't cure the practical problem. Well, I -- I thought the government's position was it had to be maintained as a national war -- as a war memorial, but not that it had to be maintained as a cross. Well, wasn't -- isn't this very different from the situation in Toledo Steel because -- Scale, I'm sorry -- because, if the merits issue that was before the Ninth Circuit was, if not technically moot, nearly moot, by the time they reached it, because of the passage of the new statute. This wasn't -- they said it's not moot because this is simply the voluntary cessation of conduct that's been held to be unlawful, but that is typically applied in the situation where there is a legitimate fear that the -- the party that has been held to be violating the Constitution may simply return to its bad old ways, once the litigation is over. But, here, you have the intervening enactment of a statute by the Constitution -- by the Congress of the United States, and I think it would be quite far-fetched to presume that Congress is simply going to repeal the statute and go back to the way things were, once the litigation is over. So you have a merits issue that's not -- if technically moot, nearly moot. The real merits issue in the case is -- is expressly not decided by the Ninth Circuit. They say, take that back to the district court. And you say that the standing issue goes away because the government didn't appeal the standing issue at a time when the real merits issue in the case had not been decided.

2009,Dolan v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Your position is that if the court puts off the order of restitution for 90 days, during that period, the defendant cannot take an appeal? Isn't that dramatically contrary to the way criminal appeals have been handled for a long time? There's a very short period of time for a defendant to file a notice of appeal in a criminal case, and you're saying that that is dramatically extended by the possibility of -- of restitution later on or by the fact that the restitution order will be entered later? Yes, I understand that. But you're saying the defendant is -- the defendant is incarcerated, let's say; is convicted, is sentenced to prison. The defendant wants to take a quick appeal. The defendant thinks he's going to win on appeal. And you're saying, well, no, you have to wait 90 days before you can file your notice of appeal? How is your position -- how is your position consistent with the thrust of the victims' rights legislation that Congress has enacted in recent years, including the statute that's before us here? Now, in this case, the victim -- the victim's medical bills were paid by the United States. But that isn't always going to be the case, and sometimes victims are going to have a lot of lost income. So you have the victim, like the victim here, who is beaten to a pulp by a defendant and loses a substantial amount of future income as a result, and you say that if the judge makes a mistake, it's just too bad for the victim. The victim gets nothing because the judge waited too long. Do you think that's what Congress had in mind? Yes, but wasn't -- wasn't the whole thrust of the victims' rights legislation that up to that point, Congress thought prosecutors were not sufficiently attending to the rights and the interests of victims? They were doing their own prosecutorial thing, but they weren't involving victims, making sure they knew about court proceedings, and so forth. And you're saying, well, if the court makes a mistake and the prosecution falls down in its responsibility, the person who suffers is the victim who gets victimized again. Well, why isn't the-- --But isn't there a difference between those two situations? A fine is a criminal penalty. It goes -- it -- the prosecution is brought in the same of the sovereign. The fine goes to the sovereign. It's a traditional criminal penalty. Restitution is not a traditional criminal penalty. It's much like, arguably, attorneys' fees in a civil case. It is -- it is like -- it is really a -- a benefit for the victim. It is not something that inures to the benefit of the sovereign. And so why doesn't it make sense to view that judgment of restitution as a separate judgment, just as the award of an attorney's fees is a separate final appealable order in a civil case? It can also include forfeiture. What's -- what is the rule for forfeiture? What is the difference -- in response to the last argument that your opponent made, what is the difference between the provision here and Rule 32(b)(1) of the criminal rules, the court must impose sentence without unnecessary delay?

2009,Alvarez v. Smith,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, has there ever been a case in which this Court has considered the merits of a dispute where the individual claims of the named plaintiffs expired before we heard argument and a -- and a class had not yet been certified? No, but that wasn't my question. The class has not yet been certified, has it? And the -- the claims of all the named plaintiffs are -- have expired? I ask you this about the government's interest involved here and the practicality of the situation, and I want to put aside the innocent owner defense, which I hope to ask your adversary about. But putting that aside, let's take what I envision as sort of the typical case where the police officer arrests someone in a vehicle for a drug offense and -- without a warrant -- and then has to file a complaint in court. What -- what is the government -- what is the burden on the government, and what would be the burden on Chicago or the State of Illinois in a requirement that within some reasonably brief period of time after that that there must be the equivalent of the filing of a complaint in court, just as you would for the arrest of an individual without a warrant, where the only issue would be whether there was probable cause for the seizure, not whether there, you know, is some innocent owner defense, but just whether there's probable cause? May I ask you-- --exactly what you think needs to take place at this hearing? And the hearing you think has to take place within 10 days? Is that your figure? Well, whatever the period is: 10 days, 14 days, whatever. Some short period. I have two questions: Must it be an adversarial hearing, and must the State disprove the innocent owner defense? Well, but my understanding of Krimstock is that a lot of those seizures -- and others know more about this than I do -- were for DWI, and that it is possible to assert an innocent owner defense there. And that's where I see a great impracticality in this. I -- I don't see how you can expect the State to come into court within such a short period and have any burden of contesting an innocent owner defense without compromising a criminal investigation. Well, let me give you this example which is pretty much based on something that you -- you wrote in your own brief. Joe is arrested on a drug offense driving a car, and there are drugs in the car. But Joe isn't the owner of the car; John is the owner of the car. Then John comes in 10 days later or 14 days later and says, well, you know, I never had any inkling that Joe was using the car to deal in drugs and had no reason to know that. And you think that within that short period of time the State has to disprove that, you know, that John didn't have-- --reason to believe that Joe was involved in drug dealing? Well, the situation is much worse than that, that they don't have the -- that they need time to investigate. They may have the registered owner under investigation. They may think he is involved in the drug conspiracy as well. They may have him on wiretaps. They may be preparing to arrest him. Now, you want to force them to come into court within 10 or 14 days and disclose the details of a -- of a pending criminal investigation and prepare to -- that makes a great-- --Well, then I don't understand how this -- how you can possibly have the innocent owner issue adjudicated at this quick hearing. I can understand the argument that you have to have the filing of the equivalent of a -- of a complaint when you -- that has to be filed when someone is arrested without a warrant, where it's not adversarial and you establish probable cause for the seizure. But when you start to go beyond that in drug forfeiture cases, at least, not -- not DWI cases, I just don't see how that's workable. ",well have there ever be a case in which this court have consider the merit of a dispute where the individual claim of the name plaintiff expire before we hear argument and a and a class have not yet be certify no but that be not my question the class have not yet be certify have it and the the claim of all the name plaintiff be have expire i ask you this about the government s interest involve here and the practicality of the situation and i want to put aside the innocent owner defense which i hope to ask your adversary about but put that aside let us take what i envision as sort of the typical case where the police officer arrest someone in a vehicle for a drug offense and without a warrant and then have to file a complaint in court what what be the government what be the burden on the government and what would be the burden on chicago or the state of illinois in a requirement that within some reasonably brief period of time after that that there must be the equivalent of the filing of a complaint in court just as you would for the arrest of an individual without a warrant where the only issue would be whether there be probable because for the seizure not whether there you know be some innocent owner defense but just whether there be probable because may i ask you exactly what you think need to take place at this hearing and the hearing you think have to take place within day be that your figure well whatever the period be day day whatever some short period i have two question must it be an adversarial hearing and must the state disprove the innocent owner defense well but my understanding of krimstock be that a lot of those seizure and others know more about this than i do we be for dwi and that it be possible to assert an innocent owner defense there and that be where i see a great impracticality in this i i do not see how you can expect the state to come into court within such a short period and have any burden of contest an innocent owner defense without compromise a criminal investigation well let me give you this example which be pretty much base on something that you you write in your own brief joe be arrest on a drug offense drive a car and there be drug in the car but joe be not the owner of the car john be the owner of the car then john come in day later or day later and say well you know i never have any inkling that joe be use the car to deal in drug and have no reason to know that and you think that within that short period of time the state have to disprove that you know that john do not have reason to believe that joe be involve in drug dealing well the situation be much bad than that that they do not have the that they need time to investigate they may have the registered owner under investigation they may think he be involve in the drug conspiracy as well they may have him on wiretap they may be prepare to arrest him now you want to force them to come into court within or day and disclose the detail of a of a pending criminal investigation and prepare to that make a great well then i do not understand how this how you can possibly have the innocent owner issue adjudicate at this quick hearing i can understand the argument that you have to have the filing of the equivalent of a of a complaint when you that have to be file when someone be arrest without a warrant where it be not adversarial and you establish probable because for the seizure but when you start to go beyond that in drug forfeiture case at least not not dwi case i just do not see how that be workable ,226.11000000000007,Roberts Court,"Oct 14, 2009","Anita Alvarez, Cook County State's Attorney","Chermane Smith, et al.",08-351,"Feb 23, 2009","Dec 8, 2009",112,1.0,1.0,0.0,1

2009,Renico v. Lett,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","May I ask you another question about what happened? After the foreperson said: No, Judge, we are not going to reach a unanimous verdict, the judge says: All right, I hereby declare a mistrial; the jury is dismissed. And then the next entry in the transcript that we have is: Well, Mr. Gordon snuck away before we could set a new trial date. Now, Mr. Gordon was defense -- was the defense attorney? So when did he leave? Do we know when he left? He was present when the judge said that she was going to declare a mistrial? Well, certainly it's good practice. If both counsel agree that there is manifest necessity for a mistrial, then there isn't going to be a double jeopardy issue in the case, isn't that right? Why would it have been difficult? Why would it be difficult for counsel to say, may we have a sidebar, and say, Your Honor, I don't think that there should be a mistrial, I think you should ask the jury to deliberate further? That isn't what the judge said just before she got the response. She said: Are you going to reach a unanimous verdict or not? And the foreperson said: No, judge. The Michigan Supreme Court cited four factors in support of its decision: the length of the deliberations in relation to the complexity of the case, the heated discussions among the jurors, the fact most importantly that the foreperson said that the jury would not be able to reach a unanimous verdict, and the fact that there was no objection by defense counsel. Is there any decision in this Court that says that under -- that in a case in which those four factors are present, that the trial judge may not grant a mistrial? And is there -- could you give us a long list of -- of lower court cases holding that in a case where those four factors are present, a trial judge may not grant a mistrial? The question is when those four factors are present, why are they not sufficient to establish that the judge was exercising sound discretion? Unless there is a decision of this Court or perhaps a huge body of lower court case law, saying that, no, even when those four factors are present you may not grant a mistrial, how do you justify the conclusion that you are asking us to draw? Well, why is that -- why is that so? If Mr. Gordon thought that this jury was 11-to-1 for acquittal, do you think he would have been reluctant to ask for a sidebar and object to the granting of a mistrial? Are you really saying that? You're saying that a lawyer in your office defending a client who thinks that the jury is leaning, is 11-to-1 for acquittal, and the judge says, well, we're going to have a mistrial and the acquittal is going out the window, the lawyer is going to be reluctant to say: Judge, may we have a sidebar, and then go to the sidebar and object to the granting of a mistrial? Well, I'm not suggesting that they were or they weren't. I'm just asking about what defense counsel would do in that situation. Maybe they are more timid in Michigan than the ones I'm familiar with. I would think that they would not be hesitant to raise an objection if they thought it was going to prejudice the client. So are you suggesting that whenever the trial judge abuses his or her discretion in granting a mistrial, there can be relief under AEDPA? It is clearly established that whenever there is an abuse of discretion, relief can be granted under AEDPA. It is an unreasonable application of our precedent? Right. You don't think it's a fair inference from the note that the jury was stuck? Do you think it's -- it's likely that they were just curious and they were rolling along just fine, but they were just curious, well, what if it happens after we deliberated a little more if we can't reach a -- a verdict? We just have a curiosity about that? Do you think that's a fair inference from that note?

Well, Respondents say that this was a -- sure, it's a -- a benefit to them to be -- to have this offset only by the amount that they received and not take into account the time value of money, but this was an incentive that lured them into accepting employment again with Xerox.

What is the test -- what is the test for determining what sort of questions can be asked in the employment context? Is there any limit? Suppose the -- suppose the Government says: Well, we want to know all about your diet. We want to know whether you smoke cigarettes. We want to know everything you read. We want to know what your hobbies are, what forms of entertainment you enjoy, sexual practices, every aspect of your private life, just because that gives us a better picture of who you are as an employee. Is that okay? Well, I had thought before the argument that one of the purposes for asking about treatment was to identify employees who may have undergone treatment on numerous occasions and dropped out of programs and been unsuccessful, so as to identify chronic drug abusers. But I guess in light of what you've just said, that this only reaches back one year, that is not a purpose of this. I don't see what the alternative, as a practical matter, is to asking this sort of open-ended question. The -- the alternative would seem to be to try to compile a list of every possible thing that the -- the person might do that would raise serious questions about suitability for employment or would be disqualifying for employment. And that seems to be impractical. There's almost no limit to the sorts of things that might be relevant in that respect; isn't that right? Well, suppose the person who works at the -- at the gift shop, or the snack bar -- I think that's what you mentioned -- has a big sign on his front lawn that says, ""I hope the space shuttle blows up.

Would it be unconstitutional for the Government to take the position that to require an employee or applicant for employment to disclose whether this individual had violated Federal or State drug laws, and take the position that if the person gave an affirmative answer that was disqualifying, would that be unconstitutional? So they could say, have you bought, sold, used drugs in violation of Federal or State law? If so, you are disqualified. Unless you can show that you have had treatment, and then it's up to you to disclose whether or not you had treatment. What's really the difference between that regime and what you have here?

2010,Staub v. Proctor Hospital,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, before we jump to agency law, shouldn't we take a look at the language of the statute? And the statute says that a prima facie case is made out if it is shown that military service, anti-military animus, was a motivating factor in the employer's action. The employer's action here was discharge, right? And the word ""motivate"" means to provide someone with a motive to do something, right? And the person who did something here was the person who discharged, discharged Mr. Staub, right? So why doesn't it follow that the motivation that is relevant under the statute is the motivation of the person who -- who performs the action that is challenged? No, but the -- what is -- what is made illegal are certain employer actions, right? Not everything that's done, not -- just writing up a bad report for a biased reason is not actionable under this statute; isn't that correct? Could I just ask where -- could I ask where your argument leads? Let's say that an employer calls in an employee and says: Now, we have to decide who to lay off, and we have looked at your record over the last 10 years, and here it is, all the evaluations you've gotten over the past 10 years, and based on all of that, we -- we've decide that you are going to be the person to be laid off. Now if it turns out that one of those evaluations was rendered by someone who had an anti-military bias, would that make the employee -- would that be a prima facie case against the employer? Even -- even if the employer at that time did every -- made every reasonable effort to investigate the validity of all the prior evaluations, still the employer would be on the hook? That isn't what the statute says. You jump over the language of the statute. It has to be a motivating factor in the decision to discharge. And that speaks -- that looks natural -- the natural reading of that is that it looks at the motivation of the person who actually makes the decision to discharge. Now, I'm not suggesting that's the right rule. That's a very unattractive rule. But the rule that you have suggested is also a very unattractive rule, one that I doubt the Congress intended to adopt. Is there no reasonable middle position here? It's all or nothing? What happens in the situation where a prior evaluation or some disciplinary action does have a substantial effect on the decision that's -- the employment decision that's made, but the employer has no notice that the prior evaluation or disciplinary action was based on a biased ground, or any reasonable way of finding out that it was based on a biased ground? What happens in that situation? How do you get around the statutory language that says that the motivating, it has to be a motivating factor in the -- in the action that is challenged? And the employer's action here is -- is discharge. Yes, but those other people -- everybody who has been delegated authority under the -- by the employer are not -- is not involved in the action that's challenged-- --does not take the action of this challenge. So maybe then the test is whether they were delegated some of the responsibility for the challenged action, were they delegated responsibility for making the discharge decision. Well, do you think that the standard for employer liability is different under this statute than under other federal antidiscrimination statutes? Is that what you were just suggesting? So if we were to hold here that the VII or under the ADEA or under the ADA? ",well before we jump to agency law should not we take a look at the language of the statute and the statute say that a prima facie case be make out if it be show that military service anti military animus be a motivating factor in the employer s action the employer s action here be discharge right and the word motivate mean to provide someone with a motive to do something right and the person who do something here be the person who discharge discharge mr staub right so why do not it follow that the motivation that be relevant under the statute be the motivation of the person who who perform the action that be challenge no but the what be what be make illegal be certain employer action right not everything that be do not just write up a bad report for a biased reason be not actionable under this statute be not that correct could i just ask where could i ask where your argument lead let us say that an employer call in an employee and say now we have to decide who to lay off and we have look at your record over the last year and here it be all the evaluation you have get over the past year and base on all of that we we have decide that you be go to be the person to be lay off now if it turn out that one of those evaluation be render by someone who have an anti military bias would that make the employee would that be a prima facie case against the employer even even if the employer at that time do every make every reasonable effort to investigate the validity of all the prior evaluation still the employer would be on the hook that be not what the statute say you jump over the language of the statute it have to be a motivating factor in the decision to discharge and that speak that look natural the natural reading of that be that it look at the motivation of the person who actually make the decision to discharge now I be not suggest that be the right rule that be a very unattractive rule but the rule that you have suggest be also a very unattractive rule one that i doubt the congress intend to adopt be there no reasonable middle position here it be all or nothing what happen in the situation where a prior evaluation or some disciplinary action do have a substantial effect on the decision that be the employment decision that be make but the employer have no notice that the prior evaluation or disciplinary action be base on a bias ground or any reasonable way of find out that it be base on a bias ground what happen in that situation how do you get around the statutory language that say that the motivating it have to be a motivating factor in the in the action that be challenge and the employer s action here be be discharge yes but those other people everybody who have be delegate authority under the by the employer be not be not involve in the action that be challenge do not take the action of this challenge so maybe then the test be whether they we be delegate some of the responsibility for the challenged action we be they delegate responsibility for make the discharge decision well do you think that the standard for employer liability be different under this statute than under other federal antidiscrimination statute be that what you we be just suggest so if we we be to hold here that the vii or under the adea or under the ada ,236.51000000000005,Roberts Court,"Nov 2, 2010",Vincent E.

Isn't that why -- isn't that where your theory leads?

Do you think -- let's take a hypothetical trial judge who, let's say, is 60 years old and has an IQ of -- that's at least an average IQ. And now you're asking this trial judge to decide whether under particular circumstances, let's say, a 14-year-old with an IQ of 85 would appreciate under particular circumstances that he or she was free to leave? You think a trial judge can really do that? They must have greater imaginative powers then. They must have greater imaginative powers than I think I would have under those circumstances. When you take a particular set of circumstances, and the judge would say, if I were 13, I would not understand that I could go. However, if I were 15, I would understand I could go. Can you slice it like that? Well, sympathetic cases can make bad law. So take the same set of facts and let's hypothesize that this is a 15-year-old. Would the 15-year-old appreciate that he could go? Or make him 16. Or make him a street-wise 17-year-old. What if the age of the person being questioned is unclear? Suppose -- suppose the person shows an ID and it shows the person is 19 years old, and the officer looks at him and says, he looks like a pretty young 19-year-old? What if -- I mean, under my example, what if the child -- what if the person looks like a minor but has an adult ID? Does the officer have an obligation to look behind that? Or the other way around? The person says, I'm 15, and the officer sees that this person has a pretty heavy beard and-- --Could I go back to an earlier question? Is it your argument that age is the only objective individual characteristic of the person being questioned that must be taken into account, or are there other objective characteristics of people being questioned who -- that fall into the same category? But what are they? I don't want to use up your rebuttal time, but what -- what are they in addition to age? For people who are not institutionalized or in school or in an environment like that? What falls into the same category as age? If the law goes down that route, then one of the chief advantages of the Miranda rule, which is that it's a relatively simple objective test, is eliminated, and the law of Miranda begins to resemble the law of voluntariness. And maybe at that point, there is no longer a strong argument in favor of Miranda, and the voluntariness test will be the sole test.

There are two things that cut very strongly against your argument. I mean, there are many things that cut in favor of it, but the two things that seem to me to cut pretty strongly against your argument are: First, that it has long been the rule that inventors have title to their patents initially, even if they make those inventions while working for somebody else. And the second is that you are relying on a provision that says that the nonprofit organization may elect to retain title, which means hold onto a title, that the -- the organization already has. There's just no accepted definition of the word ""retain"" that corresponds to the meaning that you want to assign to that word. ""Retain"" does not mean obtain.

First, the statute says the burden of establishing invalidity of a patent, et cetera, et cetera, shall rest on the parties asserting such invalidity. If Congress wanted to impose a clear and convincing burden, why in the world would they not have said that expressly in that sentence? Number two, if the first sentence, ""a patent shall be presumed valid. "" means that -- is talking about the burden, then it's superfluous, because that's dealt with in the second sentence. And, third, the phrase ""shall be presumed valid"" doesn't seem to me at all to suggest clear and convincing evidence.

So let's see what would happen if counsel is then appointed in one of these cases, where both the custodial parent and the noncustodial parent are indigent and perhaps not very well educated. Counsel is appointed for the noncustodial parent, and counsel comes in and says this is the income of my client, and he's hurt, he was hurt on the job, all his -- his income is Social Security disability benefits, and he doesn't have enough money to pay child support. Now, the custodial -- the non -- the custodial parent who has no attorney says he's not really hurt, I see him, I see him walking around, he's going hunting, he's shooting baskets, he's driving around in a new car. It may not be the -- the title may not be in his name, he's -- he's out on the street corner, he's buying drugs, he's drinking alcohol, but I don't have a lawyer and I can't prove any of this. So you've created a great imbalance there, haven't you? Why isn't something like what the solicitor general suggested adequate here? The State provides a very clear form for the noncustodial parent to fill out, and then in court the judge goes through it step by step, are you working? How much are you making? Do you have any other money? What expenses do you need for living? And then if you run into some of these complicated legal problems or arguably complicated legal problems that you referred to, maybe in particular cases there would be need for the appointment of counsel. But why isn't that adequate to deal with this situation rather than a categorical rule that you have to have counsel appointed in every case where there's an issue about ability to pay? You think the issue here is more complicated than the issue about whether somebody's probation should be revoked? There are things the judge could have asked, though, and put on the record, and it might have cleared this up. He could have -- the Petitioner here said he wasn't working and he couldn't work because he had been hurt, so the judge could have asked for medical records to substantiate that. And then the Petitioner admitted that until recently, apparently, he had been taking meth. He had been snorting coke. The judge could have said, all right, you had the money then to buy those drugs; now, where did you get that and why do you no longer have that source of money? He could have gone through a few simple steps, couldn't he, to make this -- to eliminate the problems? We don't have the Social Security disability form, but if the judge credited that and accepted that your client is -- was unable to work and had only the assets listed on that form, would he not then automatically be -- have shown that he had an inability to pay?

Alito, Jr.","Do you think that's -- do you think that's consistent with what Congress thought about rehabilitation when it adopted the Sentencing Reform Act? And you discuss their thinking, and I think accurately, in your brief, but was their thinking simply that rehabilitation is very feasible and it's reasonably predictable whether somebody can be rehabilitated or has been rehabilitated so long as it's done outside of prison, but it just doesn't work in prison? Was that their thinking? That's only one-half of what the thinking was at the time about rehabilitation. The thinking was that -- that some people were being sentenced to coercive rehabilitation, but also that other people were being paroled before they should be on the theory that they had been rehabilitated. It was a general skepticism about rehabilitation, and that is inconsistent with the idea that you can take rehabilitation into account in going down, but you can't take rehabilitation into account in going up. Yes, but that's different from saying that a lower sentence can be imposed on the theory that with rehabilitation outside of prison, a lengthier sentence isn't needed. Would you agree that when the guidelines were mandatory a judge could not sentence to -- to additional time, certainly not additional time outside the guideline range for the purpose of rehabilitation, but the judge also generally could not depart below the guideline range on the theory that this defendant had led a life of crime because the defendant lacked vocational skills or the defendant was dependent on drugs or alcohol, and with treatment outside of incarceration, those problems which had led to the criminality could be alleviated? Suppose the judge thinks that a -- a defendant would benefit from a type of a vocational or educational training that may be available in prison but that is not available in -- on the outside in the particular community where this defendant resides? What would the judge do then? No, what if that's not-- --What if it's not available in the community on the outside? Are you arguing for something like a plain statement rule, if the judge says plainly, I'm increasing your sentence so you can get rehabilitation, then there's a problem? Or would there possibly be situations in which one could infer that the desire to provide for rehabilitation in prison had influenced the sentence? For example, choosing a sentence that is just long enough to allow somebody to take advantage of a particular rehabilitation program in a -- in a prison, or where the judge goes on and on and on about the need for rehabilitation for this -- vocational training for this prisoner?

If you have, you know, you have a chance of winning, of suppressing some statements that your client made, suppressing physical evidence, getting certain evidence excluded with a motion in limine, maybe you could win on a severance motion, do you think you litigate all those rather than grabbing a good plea deal when it's offered to you?

Suppose a company has an established policy that if you want to make a complaint, there's a particular supervisor you should go to. And let's say they say you can make this complaint in writing, you can make it orally. Now, there's -- something's going on in the workplace and the supervisor happens to be walking by, maybe a machine is broken, an employee has been hurt, and an employee walks up to the supervisor who is walking briskly by, taps the supervisor on the shoulder and says the company is violating the Fair Labor Standards Act because of the placement of a clock. You said that filing has no formality requirement. Would that be the filing of a complaint? It's one thing to say that filing doesn't necessarily mean that something is written, although that's usually what the word means, isn't it? Are you filing your comments right now? You are? Really? That's the ordinary usage of the word. But to say that it includes no degree of formality, that's your argument? If that's the law and the employee gets fired and the employee says, well, this was done in retaliation for my having filed an FSLA complaint three weeks ago, and the employer says what complaint? We have no record of any such complaint and the employee says, oh, yes, I said it orally to a supervisor who was passing by and my buddy Joe was there and he's going to corroborate this.

2010,AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","I thought that -- I don't want to interrupt your complete answer. But I thought that was the gist of your argument, the heart of your argument, that traditional unconscionability in California and elsewhere focuses on unfairness to the party who is before the tribunal. So here it would be unfairness to the Concepcions, rather than unfairness to other members of the class who are not before the court. Well, maybe you can explain it this way. Compare what the Concepcions have available to them under the contract with what going through the arbitration, all the procedures leading up to arbitration and arbitration, against what they would get at best if this were allowed to proceed on a class basis. Why is -- why are they better off with a -- with a class adjudication? And -- and isn't that what distinguishes this from the ordinary unconscionability analysis? If the district court correctly understood the way the AT&T Mobility scheme works and -- and the district court said that under the revised arbitration provision nearly all consumers who purchase the informal -- who pursue, I'm sorry, the informal claims process, are very likely to be compensated promptly and in full, etcetera, etcetera. If the district court understood that correctly, the scheme here was -- is found to be unconscionable because it doesn't allow the enlistment of basically private attorneys general to enforce -- to enforce the law. And isn't that quite different from ordinary unconscionability analysis? Can I take you back to a question that was asked a few minutes ago, because I'm not sure I understood your answer. What is the difference between a State rule that says that the rules of civil procedure must be followed in any adjudication and a rule that says that class adjudication must always be available? Yes, uh-huh. No, I just -- I'm not putting this under an unconscionability label. These are just general rules, and the question is whether they -- whether they can be applied, whether they constitute discrimination against -- against arbitration. Why? No, but I really would appreciate it if you would answer my hypothetical on one that was posed before. What is the difference -- let me change it slightly -- between a rule that says you must follow the rules of evidence in every adjudication and a rule that says that class adjudication must always be available? I think your answer comes down to the proposition that the former is inconsistent with the idea of arbitration, and therefore, that's why it's not allowed, and the latter is not inconsistent with the idea of arbitration, and therefore, it is allowed. Is that correct or not? Well, okay. It amounts to the same thing. Insisting on compliance with the Federal -- with the California rules of evidence is an obstacle to arbitration, but allowing -- insisting on the availability of class adjudication is not an obstacle to arbitration. But in the end-- --we have to make a value judgment about whether these things, one thing or the other, fits with arbitration. That's what it comes down to. And when it -- when it imposes the rule that the -- the rules of evidence apply across the board, it says it feels that these are necessary in order for parties to be treated fairly in every method of adjudication.

2010,DePierre v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","If we agree with you, how should a judge instruct a jury to determine whether a substance is crack? Should the judge use the definition in the sentencing guidelines? But in those-- --It has to have all three of those characteristics? But I thought you just said that freebase would qualify, and freebase would not have the second of those characteristics; isn't that right? It was -- it would not be prepared using a base? So if it had any base? Other than crack and free base, are there other forms of cocaine base that are actually in use in any substantial amounts in this country by drug users? Are there actually people in the United States who are smoking coca, coca paste? I thought that that was exclusive to South America. Are you aware of cases where that's happened? To go back to your definition of crack, just so I'm clear on it, if a substance -- in the second prong of your definition, if a substance is tested and chemically it is pure [C17H21NO4,] no trace of sodium bicarbonate, no trace of ammonium, is it possible for a defendant to be convicted and given the crack penalty? That's right. And I don't think -- could you just reiterate what the second prong of your test is because I thought -- I was under the impression it required the presence of a reactant. So you need extrinsic evidence about how this particular substance was prepared in order to satisfy it? If you don't have the trace elements of the reactant, you need evidence that that's how this was made? What if it's pulverized? I don't know whether that's possible, but could you grind it up so that it's not rock-like anymore, so it's like a powder-- --and smoke it after it's in that form? No, but you could have -- in Romanette (iii), they could have said 50 grams or more of a mixture or substance which contains cocaine base, period. There was no need to have it described in clause 2 if there's nothing implied in Romanette (ii) that is not also in Romanette (iii) with respect to cocaine. On your submission, it's just bad draftsmanship? What about optical and geometric isomers of cocaine? Those -- those fall under Romanette (ii), Roman (II), but not under (iii). Are there such things? Well, my understanding of how coke -- how the paste is produced is the following: You start with the leaves; then people vigorously macerate the leaves by stomping on them for an hour or more; and then this mixture is -- this -- what's left is mixed with an alkaline material such as sodium bicarbonate, an organic solvent, such as kerosene, and water; and what you end up with is a gummy, yellowish solid called coca paste; is that -- that's correct? Yes. Now, if a chemist analyzed that or then analyzed crack or freebase, wouldn't there be present in the coca paste lots of other substances that would not be present, in quantities? Other substances would be present in quantities in the coca paste that would not be present in the crack or the freebase? So a DEA chemist could test -- could test a substance and say this is coca paste of the type that is smoked in South America by some people. This is crack or freebase that has been mixed with water into a pasty substance -- a chemist could make that -- that differentiation, couldn't they?

2010,Fowler v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","The statute speaks of the intent of the defendant. The defendant must intend to prevent the communication of information about a Federal offense or a possible Federal offense to a law enforcement officer who happens to be a Federal law enforcement officer. So, it's all a matter of intent. Where do you get this question of whether it's possible or likely or certain or whatever that the information will eventually get to a Federal law enforcement officer? Isn't it -- isn't it simply what is in the mind of the defendant? What do you say that is-- --The reasonable likelihood that this person who was killed -- now, you say ""realistic likelihood"". Well, why don't we pick the standard that is set out in the text of the statute? Let me give you this example: Let's -- let's hypothesize a very cold, calculating, rational defendant who is planning a Federal crime, let's say the hijacking of an airplane over international waters, and this defendant finds out that his mother has learned about the plot. Now, he says, well, you know, I think there's a one-tenth of 1 percent chance that mom is going to go to the FBI and turn me in, but in order to prevent that, I'm going to kill her. I intend -- I kill her with the -- for the purpose of preventing her from going to the FBI, even though I think very, very, very unlikely she's going to do that. Hasn't that defendant violated this statute? The issue -- the issue here is the sufficiency of the evidence. So -- so -- and the question is whether a reasonable juror could adopt a certain view of the facts. Now, couldn't a reasonable juror in this situation take this view of the facts? Your client killed Officer Horner simply because your client didn't want to go to jail. He didn't particularly care whether he was going to be prosecuted in State court or Federal court; he just didn't want to go to jail. So his intent was to prevent the communication of information about the crimes that were being planned to any law enforcement officer who could send him to jail, and that would include a State officer; it also would include a Federal officer. And, therefore, there's a violation of the statute. Now, what's wrong with that view of the facts? No, because if there were -- if the only crimes that were being planned were State offenses, then there would be no chance that -- that the conveying of that information to a Federal law enforcement officer would send the person to jail. They're planning -- they're planning to hold up a convenience store. It's not a Federal offense; it's a State offense. So, the person isn't going to go to jail on a Federal charge. Well, are you saying that there is no possible offense that's only a violation of State law and Federal law? All right. Let me give you a hypothetical similar to the one that I gave your -- your friend. Two men are sitting on a park bench planning the commission of a Federal crime, hijacking of an airplane, and they think they're by themselves; so they're talking about this, and then after they've had a discussion they turn around and they see there's somebody standing very close by; and so they say we have to kill this person to prevent him from going to the FBI, and so they do, and they're prosecuted under this statute. But then at trial they bring out evidence that the person didn't speak a word of English, only spoke Russian. So there wasn't any possibility whatsoever that this person was going to report that to the FBI or any law enforcement officer. Violation of this statute or not? So a realistic probability relates only to the question of whether it would have been conveyed to a Federal officer as opposed to some other law enforcement officer? Let's say the case -- that this case arises -- exactly this case arises in two different adjacent jurisdictions. In one, the local sheriff and the local district attorney hate the Feds. They never talk to them unless they absolutely have to. And so if Officer Horner had taken the information that he learned to the local sheriff, there's no chance whatsoever that they would have referred that over to the FBI or the U.S. attorney for prosecution in Federal Court, so no realistic possibility there. In the other jurisdiction, right next door, the local sheriff and the local DA don't want to be bothered with bank robbery trials. They send all of those over to the FBI and the U.S. attorney, so there's a very high probability the information would have gotten to the Federal authorities. Now, would this case come out differently depending on the jurisdiction? So if a defendant has in mind a particular officer, then there's a potential violation of the statute, but if the defendant just kills for the purpose of preventing this from going to any Federal -- any officer who might happen to be a Federal officer, then there's no violation under this -- under this reading of the statute? Under the interpretation that's been suggested to you, that would be the distinction? ",the statute speaks of the intent of the defendant the defendant must intend to prevent the communication of information about a federal offense or a possible federal offense to a law enforcement officer who happen to be a federal law enforcement officer so it be all a matter of intent where do you get this question of whether it be possible or likely or certain or whatever that the information will eventually get to a federal law enforcement officer be not it be not it simply what be in the mind of the defendant what do you say that be the reasonable likelihood that this person who be kill now you say realistic likelihood well why do not we pick the standard that be set out in the text of the statute let me give you this example let us let us hypothesize a very cold calculate rational defendant who be plan a federal crime let us say the hijacking of an airplane over international water and this defendant find out that his mother have learn about the plot now he say well you know i think there be a one tenth of percent chance that mom be go to go to the fbi and turn me in but in order to prevent that I be go to kill her i intend i kill her with the for the purpose of prevent her from go to the fbi even though i think very very very unlikely she be go to do that have not that defendant violate this statute the issue the issue here be the sufficiency of the evidence so so and the question be whether a reasonable juror could adopt a certain view of the fact now could not a reasonable juror in this situation take this view of the fact your client kill officer horner simply because your client do not want to go to jail he do not particularly care whether he be go to be prosecute in state court or federal court he just do not want to go to jail so his intent be to prevent the communication of information about the crime that we be be plan to any law enforcement officer who could send him to jail and that would include a state officer it also would include a federal officer and therefore there be a violation of the statute now what be wrong with that view of the fact no because if there we be if the only crime that we be be plan we be state offense then there would be no chance that that the conveying of that information to a federal law enforcement officer would send the person to jail they be plan they be plan to hold up a convenience store it be not a federal offense it be a state offense so the person be not go to go to jail on a federal charge well be you say that there be no possible offense that be only a violation of state law and federal law all right let me give you a hypothetical similar to the one that i give your your friend two men be sit on a park bench plan the commission of a federal crime hijack of an airplane and they think they be by themselves so they be talk about this and then after they have have a discussion they turn around and they see there be somebody stand very close by and so they say we have to kill this person to prevent him from go to the fbi and so they do and they be prosecute under this statute but then at trial they bring out evidence that the person do not speak a word of english only speak russian so there be not any possibility whatsoever that this person be go to report that to the fbi or any law enforcement officer violation of this statute or not so a realistic probability relate only to the question of whether it would have be convey to a federal officer as oppose to some other law enforcement officer let us say the case that this case arise exactly this case arise in two different adjacent jurisdiction in one the local sheriff and the local district attorney hate the fed they never talk to them unless they absolutely have to and so if officer horner have take the information that he learn to the local sheriff there be no chance whatsoever that they would have refer that over to the fbi or the us attorney for prosecution in federal court so no realistic possibility there in the other jurisdiction right next door the local sheriff and the local da do not want to be bother with bank robbery trial they send all of those over to the fbi and the us attorney so there be a very high probability the information would have get to the federal authority now would this case come out differently depend on the jurisdiction so if a defendant have in mind a particular officer then there be a potential violation of the statute but if the defendant just kill for the purpose of prevent this from go to any federal any officer who might happen to be a federal officer then there have no violation under this under this reading of the statute under the interpretation that be be suggest to you that would be the distinction ,309.94,Roberts Court,"Mar 29, 2011","Charles Andrew Fowler, aka Man",United States,10-5443,"Nov 15, 2010","May 26, 2011",112,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2010,Connick v. Thompson,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Can we just -- can we clear something up? Are you accepting the proposition that Brady always requires that lab reports be turned over? I know you concede that there was a Brady violation here, but in answer to some of the questions it seems to me that you were possibly -- or at least you did not express an opinion on the suggestion that it is always a violation of Brady to fail to turn over a lab report. Yes, if you could -- could you just say as succinctly as possible what you would tell assistant district attorneys if you were the district attorney for this jurisdiction, and you with the benefit of hindsight, having seen this case, what kind of -- what would you tell them they should do with respect to Brady? No, but you are training them, so: Now I want to tell you what you have to do under Brady. What do you tell them? I really would appreciate it if you'd get to my question. Brady requires that exculpatory evidence be turned over. Now, do you -- do you think the assistant prosecutors didn't even know that? Okay. Now, you phrase -- you are the instructor. You phrase the lesson that you think is required by Brady that has to be given to them. I mean, with respect, I really don't, as a young district -- assistant district attorney, that you have told me anything that's going to be really helpful to me other than, you know, follow the law, which you certainly should do, in dealing with my obligation to turn over physical evidence, which is what's involved here. Or a lab report regarding physical evidence. Now, suppose I have -- I have several cases. I have this case, where I have got blood -- I have physical evidence, I have a blood test. I have another case where all I had was physical evidence, but there has been no testing on it. Now, do I have to turn over that physical evidence? I have to turn over all physical evidence that's in my possession? Okay. Now, what's the instruction that you are going to give me to tell me where I'm going to draw that line? Well, how do I know that before-- --How do I know that before the physical evidence is tested? Suppose I've got all sorts of items that were found at the scene, and they might have DNA on them. They might have epithelial samples on them. You know, all this fancy forensic testing that is done these days. Do I have to turn over all of that? Now, you see what I'm getting at is that you are dealing with a very specific situation. So the instruction would be: If you have physical evidence and you have tested it for blood and you have a -- you have the result of the blood test, but you don't know whether -- you don't know the blood type of the accused, that -- that's Brady evidence, and that has to be turned over. And you are saying that the failure to provide training to every assistant district attorney on a question of that specificity gives rise to a -- a potential claim, gives rise to a claim? But the judge actually, though, instructed the jury -- this is back on JA 828 -- in order to find that the district attorney's failure to adequately train, monitor or supervise amounted to -- deliberate indifference, etcetera. So liability could have been predicated not on the lack of adequate training, but the absence of a process by which superiors in the district attorney's office reviewed all of the Brady decisions that were made by more junior prosecutors; isn't that correct? Why wouldn't -- why wouldn't that be error? That is, the head of a very large office is personally liable under Canton for violations that are -- that are produced by actions taken by subordinates, unless there is an elaborate process to review all of the decisions that are made by those subordinates? Doesn't that go well beyond anything Canton permits? Mr. Cooney, when you -- when you gave the specific instruction which you think should be provided to assistant district attorneys, what you stated was a questionable understanding of Brady, I think. You -- did I understand you correctly? You said that Brady means that if the prosecutor has physical evidence which if tested might establish the defendant's innocence, that is exculpatory evidence that must be turned over? Isn't that to do with Arizona v Youngblood. ",can we just can we clear something up be you accept the proposition that brady always require that lab report be turn over i know you concede that there be a brady violation here but in answer to some of the question it seem to me that you we be possibly or at least you do not express an opinion on the suggestion that it be always a violation of brady to fail to turn over a lab report yes if you could could you just say as succinctly as possible what you would tell assistant district attorney if you we be the district attorney for this jurisdiction and you with the benefit of hindsight have see this case what kind of what would you tell them they should do with respect to brady no but you be train them so now i want to tell you what you have to do under brady what do you tell them i really would appreciate it if you would get to my question brady require that exculpatory evidence be turn over now do you do you think the assistant prosecutor do not even know that okay now you phrase you be the instructor you phrase the lesson that you think be require by brady that have to be give to them i mean with respect i really do not as a young district assistant district attorney that you have tell me anything that be go to be really helpful to me other than you know follow the law which you certainly should do in deal with my obligation to turn over physical evidence which be what be involve here or a lab report regard physical evidence now suppose i have i have several case i have this case where i have get blood i have physical evidence i have a blood test i have another case where all i have be physical evidence but there have be no test on it now do i have to turn over that physical evidence i have to turn over all physical evidence that be in my possession okay now what be the instruction that you be go to give me to tell me where I be go to draw that line well how do i know that before how do i know that before the physical evidence be test suppose I have get all sort of item that we be find at the scene and they might have dna on them they might have epithelial sample on them you know all this fancy forensic testing that be do these day do i have to turn over all of that now you see what I be get at be that you be deal with a very specific situation so the instruction would be if you have physical evidence and you have test it for blood and you have a you have the result of the blood test but you do not know whether you do not know the blood type of the accuse that that be brady evidence and that have to be turn over and you be say that the failure to provide training to every assistant district attorney on a question of that specificity give rise to a a potential claim give rise to a claim but the judge actually though instruct the jury this be back on ja in order to find that the district attorney s failure to adequately train monitor or supervise amount to deliberate indifference etcetera so liability could have be predicate not on the lack of adequate training but the absence of a process by which superior in the district attorney s office review all of the brady decision that we be make by more junior prosecutor be not that correct why would not why would not that be error that be the head of a very large office be personally liable under canton for violation that be that be produce by action take by subordinate unless there be an elaborate process to review all of the decision that be make by those subordinate do not that go well beyond anything canton permit mr cooney when you when you give the specific instruction which you think should be provide to assistant district attorney what you state be a questionable understanding of brady i think you do i understand you correctly you say that brady mean that if the prosecutor have physical evidence which if test might establish the defendant s innocence that be exculpatory evidence that must be turn over be not that to do with arizona v youngblood ,259.8299999999999,Roberts Court,"Oct 6, 2010","Harry F.

2010,"Los Angeles County, CA v. Humphries",112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, the Respondents here argue that, don't they? That you should have created a procedure on your own, right? Now, if the -- presumably, that could be brought to the -- that could be brought before someone who is a county policymaker, couldn't it, when you are talking about something that's going -- that's ongoing in the future? And then that would fall within Monell. So that's why I'm somewhat puzzled about what this case is about. When are we going to get into a situation in which the plaintiffs are asking for prospective relief and the matter cannot be brought before a municipal or county policymaker? Now, if that's the case, why wouldn't one of the following be possible? If you -- you say we have no discretion here, we are required -- we are totally bound by the State procedures; we can't add any new procedure. They say, well, that's unconstitutional. So -- and you are choosing to do something that is unconstitutional that is required by State law. In that situation, won't you have adopted a policy? An Ex Parte Young situation. What would happen under California law if you said, we agree with the Respondents that additional procedures are constitutionally required, so even though California law doesn't allow this, we are going to create these procedures because we have to comply with the Constitution. What would your situation be under California law? Would you be subject to -- what could the State do to you? I'm sorry? I have a question similar to Justice Sotomayor's. Suppose we were to hold that the Monell requirement applies to prospective relief, injunctive and declaratory relief. Can you provide an example of just an unacceptable consequence that would follow from that holding, a situation in which that holding would, in your judgment, be one that we would not want to accept? Well, what difference does it make? All right. Now we have a situation. The clerk denies the marriage license. And then I presume you can take the matter before a municipal policymaker, and the municipal policymaker will say, this is our policy, license denied, or this is not our policy. And then Monell is satisfied, right? If the policymaker says, it is our policy to deny licenses under these circumstances, that's a policy. I'm still waiting to hear what cases it will screen out. I haven't heard an example of a case that it would screen out. But whether you were free to do it or not under California law, how can there not -- how can it not be your policy that you have refused to provide these procedures which they say are constitutionally required? Your policy is to follow an arguably unconstitutional State requirement rather than comply with what is arguably required by the Constitution. Why isn't that a policy? Now, all that's at stake is -- and of course it's a matter of practical importance, but all that's at stake is a monetary dispute between the State of California and the County of Los Angeles, which as far as the federal Constitution is concerned, is the same thing as the State of California. So why should we be concerned about this at all? I don't understand why there is not a policy here. Yes, but all that is involved is money between -- between California and a creature of California. As far as the Federal Constitution is concerned, California could abolish the County of Los Angeles. California could subsidize you for your attorneys fees or they could levy some sort of -- something upon you and require you to pay them additional money. None of that -- what's the constitutional concern in all of that? But do you think that the Federal court has to decide the issue of California law, namely, whether you have freedom under this particular statute to add an additional procedures to the California statute? Well, isn't that something that should be decided in State court? Why isn't this a beef between the State and the State's creature, the County of Los Angeles? ",well the respondent here argue that do not they that you should have create a procedure on your own right now if the presumably that could be bring to the that could be bring before someone who be a county policymaker could not it when you be talk about something that be go that be ongoing in the future and then that would fall within monell so that be why I be somewhat puzzled about what this case be about when be we go to get into a situation in which the plaintiff be ask for prospective relief and the matter can not be bring before a municipal or county policymaker now if that be the case why would not one of the following be possible if you you say we have no discretion here we be require we be totally bind by the state procedure we can not add any new procedure they say well that be unconstitutional so and you be choose to do something that be unconstitutional that be require by state law in that situation will not you have adopt a policy an ex parte young situation what would happen under california law if you say we agree with the respondent that additional procedure be constitutionally require so even though california law do not allow this we be go to create these procedure because we have to comply with the constitution what would your situation be under california law would you be subject to what could the state do to you I be sorry i have a question similar to justice sotomayor s suppose we we be to hold that the monell requirement applies to prospective relief injunctive and declaratory relief can you provide an example of just an unacceptable consequence that would follow from that hold a situation in which that hold would in your judgment be one that we would not want to accept well what difference do it make all right now we have a situation the clerk deny the marriage license and then i presume you can take the matter before a municipal policymaker and the municipal policymaker will say this be our policy license deny or this be not our policy and then monell be satisfied right if the policymaker say it be our policy to deny license under these circumstance that be a policy I be still wait to hear what case it will screen out i have not hear an example of a case that it would screen out but whether you we be free to do it or not under california law how can there not how can it not be your policy that you have refuse to provide these procedure which they say be constitutionally require your policy be to follow an arguably unconstitutional state requirement rather than comply with what be arguably require by the constitution why be not that a policy now all that be at stake be and of course it be a matter of practical importance but all that be at stake be a monetary dispute between the state of california and the county of los angeles which as far as the federal constitution be concern be the same thing as the state of california so why should we be concern about this at all i do not understand why there be not a policy here yes but all that be involve be money between between california and a creature of california as far as the federal constitution be concern california could abolish the county of los angeles california could subsidize you for your attorney fee or they could levy some sort of something upon you and require you to pay them additional money none of that what be the constitutional concern in all of that but do you think that the federal court have to decide the issue of california law namely whether you have freedom under this particular statute to add an additional procedure to the california statute well be not that something that should be decide in state court why be not this a beef between the state and the state s creature the county of los angeles ,256.39000000000004,Roberts Court,"Oct 5, 2010","Los Angeles County, CA",Craig Arthur Humphries et al.,09-350,"Feb 22, 2010","Nov 30, 2010",112,1.0,1.0,0.0,1

If a video game manufacturer has to decide under your statute how to -- where its game stands, what age of a child should the manufacturer have in mind? A 17-year-old? A 10-year-old? How can they -- how can they do that? Isn't the average person likely to think that what's appropriate for a 17-year-old may not be appropriate for a 10-year-old or an 8-year-old? Well, I think what Justice Scalia wants to know is what James Madison thought about video games. [Laughter] Did he enjoy them? Do you think there is any barrier in California to minors' access to sexual material? Does your office spend a lot of time enforcing that? What if the State passed a -- what if California took the list of video games that your association rates as mature and said there's a civil penalty. And you apparently don't want your -- you don't want vendors selling those games to minors, isn't that right? You don't want that. And what if California said there is a civil penalty attached to that? You seem to argue that there really is no good reason to think that exposure to video games is bad for minors, exposure to really violent video games is bad to minors; is that right? But we have here a new -- a new medium that cannot possibly have been envisioned at the time when the First Amendment was ratified. It is totally different from -- it's one thing to read a description of -- as one of -- one of these video games is promoted as saying, ""What's black and white and red all over? "" ""Perhaps the answer could include disposing of your enemies in a meat grinder. "" Now, reading that is one thing. Seeing it as graphically portrayed-- --and doing it is still a third thing. So this presents a question that could not have been specifically contemplated at the time when the First Amendment was adopted. And to say, well, because nobody was -- because descriptions in a book of violence were not considered a category of speech that was appropriate for limitation at the time when the First Amendment was violated is entirely artificial. Let me be clear about exactly what your argument is. Your argument is that there is nothing that a State can do to limit minors' access to the most violent, sadistic, graphic video game that can be developed. That's your argument-- --Is it or isn't it? And you say there is no problem because 16-year-olds in California never have $50 available to go buy a video game, and because they never have TVs in their room and their parents are always home watching what they -- they do with their video games, and the parents -- and the video games have features that allow parents to block access to -- to block the playing of violent video games, which can't be overcome by a computer-savvy California 16-year-old, that's why there is no problem, right?

Can you explain what the connection is between the 137.5 percent figure and the constitutional violations relating to the provision of medical care in general and treatment for -- for mental illness? My understanding of the 137.5 percent figure is that that has to do with the total number of prisoners in the -- in the system in relation to designed capacity, isn't that right? Now, what does the ruling -- that doesn't speak to the number of personnel who are available in the system to attend to medical needs or mental illness? It doesn't speak to the extent of the facilities that are available for those purposes. It seems to be -- there seems to be a disconnect between those two. Could you explain why that is narrowly tailored? See, that's what I don't understand. You can have a -- could you not have a prison where the cells are somewhat crowded and 137.5 percent of designed capacity is not -- is not unconstitutional in itself, is it? You could have a prison where the -- the cells themselves are crowded, and yet there are other facilities available for medical care and plenty of staff to attend to those things. So what's the connection? But why order the release of around 40,000 prisoners, many of whom, perhaps the great majority of whom, are not going to be within the class in either of these lawsuits? Why order the release of all those people, rather than ordering the provision of the construction of facilities for medical care, facilities to treat mental illness, hiring of staff to treat mental illness? Why not go directly to the problem rather than address what seems to be a different issue altogether? If all they do is to build more cells, they are not going to address the problem. I still don't get it. You're saying that they were ordered to do a variety of things that directly addressed the problem and they didn't comply. So as a -- In order to -- in order to provide some kind of remedy we are going to order something else that doesn't address the problems that these lawsuits aim at addressing. That is a very indirect way of addressing the problem and it has collateral consequences. If -- if I were a citizen of California, I would be concerned about the release of 40,000 prisoners and I don't care what you term it, a prison release order or whatever the -- -- terminology you used was. If 40,000 prisoners are going to be released, you really believe that if you were to come back here two years after that, you would be able to say, they haven't -- they haven't contributed to an increase in crime -- -- in the State of California? In the -- in the amicus brief that was submitted by a number of states, there is an extended discussion of the effect of one prisoner release order with which I am familiar, and that was in Philadelphia and after a period of time they tallied up what the cost of that was, the number of murders, the number of rapes, the number of armed robberies, the number of assaults -- you don't -- that's not going to happen in California? Isn't it true that in one of the main programs that was cited as providing a safeguard is evidence-based rehabilitation programs? What is the general record on the success of rehabilitation efforts? What did Congress think when it enacted the sentencing format? What is the recidivism rate for those parolees? In general, what is the recidivism rate? What is the lowest? It's 17 percent. Well, I understood that of the low-risk, if only the low-risk people are released, around 3,000 of them are going to commit another crime. They don't have to be released if you can build enough cells -- The 17 percent figure goes exactly to my concern. This is going to have -- it seems likely this is going to have an effect on public safety and the experts can testify to whatever they want, but you know what, if this order goes into effect, we will see. We will see, and the people of California will see. Are there more crimes or are there not?

Well, you are arguing in favor of -- you are arguing in favor of a very idiosyncratic interpretation of the concept of a discriminatory tax, aren't you? In almost any other context, granting tax exemptions to one group but denying them to another group would be viewed as -- if there isn't a good reason for drawing the distinction, as discrimination, wouldn't it? And it did so with explicit language by -- in -- what is it -- (a)(4), by referring to property that is subject to a property tax levy. So what you're saying is that the ordinary interpretation of the concept of a discriminatory tax should not be applied here, because Congress used specific language to take tax exemptions out of the determination of discrimination under other provisions. What sense does that make? What sense does that make? The fact that they specifically took it out of some provisions but not out of this provision, you think, leads to the implication that they meant to put it in here, too, where they could have easily used language here to put it in. So it's a commodity that is purchased by only railroads and one other class, and there is a 4 percent sales tax on this commodity, but the other class is exempt from the tax. Now, is that -- is that discrimination against the railroad?

Let -- and just determining the facts is going to be hard enough, but let's assume all the facts are proven, there's not a dispute about the facts.

2010,Bullcoming v. New Mexico,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, that's not -- I don't think that's what Melendez-Diaz' footnote 1 says. It says that the State may be able to prove chain of custody by testimony other than the actual individuals who handled the sample, and then it has to take its chances as to whether the trier of fact is going to believe -- is going to believe that. Isn't that right? But as to those persons who-- --Okay. Go ahead. Yes. Could we break this down in -- in this way? I see three things that the -- three statements that the -- the State was attempting to -- to prove. The first was that the sample that was tested was the sample that was taken from the defendant. Second was that the standard procedures were followed in this case, and the third was that the result was.21. Would you agree with that? Those are the three things? All right. That the sample had not been tampered with. Now, as to the first three, in other words, everything other than the results, could the State prove those things without having -- simply by introducing testimony regarding the way things were generally done in the lab, and ask the jury to infer that the general procedures were followed in this particular case? It wouldn't be a Confrontation-- --All right. Now, in this case, as I read the record, it seems to me that's what the prosecutor was attempting to do. This is on page 50 of the Joint Appendix. The analyst is beginning to testify, the second answer on page 50: So what we do is we will get the sample in the mail, et cetera. The analyst is beginning to testify about standard lab procedures, and then defense attorney says, ""Your Honor, I'm going to object to what's done in the status quo. "" I take that to mean what is generally done. ""I don't object to what was done in this case. "" So the defense attorney is preventing -- is objecting to the prosecution's attempting to discharge its responsibility with respect to those first three propositions through testimony about standard procedures, and is insisting that the analyst provide the testimony that you say was a violation of the Confrontation Clause; namely, testifying as to what was done in this particular case. But if the -- if the machine had expelled a piece of paper that said.21, that piece of paper would not be a -- introduction of that piece of paper, the contents of the piece of paper, would not be a violation of the Confrontation Clause? Well, how can -- how can you debate it? The purpose of the Confrontation Clause is to allow cross-examination. How are you going to cross-examine the machine? But all of those other things could potentially be proven by indirect evidence, by establishing standard procedures and asking the jury to infer that the standard procedures were followed in this case. They might -- they might believe that; they might not-- --They might make the inference; they might not. But as to this case, didn't the defendant actually testify that he was drunk at the time of -- at the time when the blood was extracted? He took the stand and he testified that after the accident he went off into the woods and he came upon people who were drinking vodka and he drank, they drank -- what was it -- a gallon of vodka together, and then he went back to the scene and his blood was tested? Isn't that correct? But the State can't-- --The State can't immunize those people from testifying. You could have subpoenaed Caylor, couldn't you? You could have asked for a continuance and -- and a subpoena, and brought him in to testify? It's just a question of who has to take the step, right? Are these lab analysts civil service employees? Are the lab analysts civil service employees? Is there any way in which your office or prosecutors or the police could cause them not to get promotions if they weren't producing the kind of lab reports that the police and the prosecution might like?

2010,Sykes v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","I think the problem with your argument is that the prosecution is not under any obligation to charge any offense greater than the offense for which your client was convicted in a case in which there is a very grave risk created by flight. Isn't that true? Yes. So the fact that someone is convicted of this offense does not show that a broad category of offenses within this crime lack the risk that's necessary under the Armed Career Criminal Act. Are you familiar with the case called Hape v. State in the Indiana Court of Appeals 2009? Hape. H-a-p-e. During a 45 -- and this involved the offense at issue here. During a 45-minute high-speed chase officers shot at the defendant's truck at least 20 times. The State's facts showed that the defendant drove over 100 miles an hour and at times drove into the oncoming traffic lane. Do you think that creates a -- a serious potential risk of -- of harm? I believe he is convicted of the same offense as -- as Mr. Sykes. Suppose the legislature were to repeal (b)(1)(B). Would the offense for which Mr. Sykes was convicted then become an ACCA offense? No, it's the opposite. If the aggravated offense -- you rely on the aggravated offense-- --in large part as a basis for your argument. Your argument -- one of your main arguments, as I understand it, is that what I'll call the simple offense doesn't qualify under ACCA because cases involving a serious risk of bodily injury fall under the aggravated category, and my question is whether a repeal of the aggravated offense would change -- would then convert the simple offense from a non-ACCA offense to an ACCA offense. Or you could ask it a different way. If State one has the simple offense and the aggravated offense, State two has just the simple offense, is the simple offense an ACCA offense in one State and not in the other State even though the elements are exactly the same? But you're answering my question by making a totally different argument. Insofar as you're relying on the aggravated offense, the presence of the aggravated offense, I would appreciate an answer to it. In other words, you're saying -- maybe I haven't made myself clear. Justice Scalia's answer, which you have adopted, is that if you look at (A) by itself, forget about the aggravated offense completely, it doesn't qualify under ACCA, and that's -- that's one argument. But your other argument is that (A), the simple offense, doesn't qualify because of the presence of (B). And I'm trying to just see whether that makes sense. Isn't it still an empirical question? If we were to look at all of the cases that are prosecuted under what I'll call the simple offense, we might discover that those are all cases in which there is no serious potential risk of physical injury created because all of the risky cases are prosecuted under the aggravated label. We might also find that there are still a great many cases that involve a serious potential risk that are prosecuted under the simple category. So the fact that there's a gradation doesn't allow us to escape the empirical issue, does it? I wouldn't say that they didn't have a rational basis for dividing it. It would just show a pattern of prosecution and plea bargaining. That's what it would show. There never is really reliable empirical data, almost never, for any of the issues that have to be decided under the -- the catch-all, the residual clause, of ACCA. It has to be based on basically common sense and experience, doesn't it? Is speeding a felony? Could I ask you this: If a person is convicted of vehicular flight that causes death, is that aggressive conduct? Is the conduct there any different from the conduct when death doesn't result? That's not true. There are -- you can -- there are prison escapes all the time where it is done through subterfuge. ",i think the problem with your argument be that the prosecution be not under any obligation to charge any offense great than the offense for which your client be convict in a case in which there be a very grave risk create by flight be not that true yes so the fact that someone be convict of this offense do not show that a broad category of offense within this crime lack the risk that be necessary under the arm career criminal act be you familiar with the case call hape v state in the indiana court of appeal hape h a p e during a and this involve the offense at issue here during a minute high speed chase officer shoot at the defendant s truck at least time the state s fact show that the defendant drive over mile an hour and at time drove into the oncoming traffic lane do you think that create a a serious potential risk of of harm i believe he be convict of the same offense as as mr sykes suppose the legislature we be to repeal b b would the offense for which mr sykes be convict then become an acca offense no it be the opposite if the aggravated offense you rely on the aggravate offense in large part as a basis for your argument your argument one of your main argument as i understand it be that what I will call the simple offense do not qualify under acca because case involve a serious risk of bodily injury fall under the aggravated category and my question be whether a repeal of the aggravated offense would change would then convert the simple offense from a non acca offense to an acca offense or you could ask it a different way if state one have the simple offense and the aggravated offense state two have just the simple offense be the simple offense an acca offense in one state and not in the other state even though the element be exactly the same but you be answer my question by make a totally different argument insofar as you be rely on the aggravated offense the presence of the aggravated offense i would appreciate an answer to it in other word you be say maybe i have not make myself clear justice scalia s answer which you have adopt be that if you look at a by itself forget about the aggravated offense completely it do not qualify under acca and that be that be one argument but your other argument be that a the simple offense do not qualify because of the presence of b and I be try to just see whether that make sense be not it still an empirical question if we we be to look at all of the case that be prosecute under what I will call the simple offense we might discover that those be all case in which there be no serious potential risk of physical injury create because all of the risky case be prosecute under the aggravated label we might also find that there be still a great many case that involve a serious potential risk that be prosecute under the simple category so the fact that there be a gradation do not allow us to escape the empirical issue do it i would not say that they do not have a rational basis for divide it it would just show a pattern of prosecution and plea bargaining that be what it would show there never be really reliable empirical data almost never for any of the issue that have to be decide under the the catch all the residual clause of acca it have to be base on basically common sense and experience do not it be speed a felony could i ask you this if a person be convict of vehicular flight that cause death be that aggressive conduct be the conduct there any different from the conduct when death do not result that be not true there be you can there be prison escapes all the time where it be do through subterfuge ,257.95,Roberts Court,"Jan 12, 2011",Marcus Sykes,United States,09-11311,"Sep 28, 2010","Jun 9, 2011",112,0.0,1.0,0.0,0

Circuit's decision in Crooker has been the leading decision in this -- on this issue for nearly 30 years and there has been a great deal of reliance on it, certainly by the lower courts in general, and perhaps also by Congress and by the Executive Branch. Do you think there is anything to be said for deference to that decision based on the fact that it has been -- there has been reliance on it to such a great degree for such a period of time? I ask -- I ask the question because the world has changed in a lot of ways since 1981, and one is that there is now I think much greater concern about the disclosure of information that has perhaps profound security implications. That was not as much of a concern in -- in 1981. If you think about, for example, suppose there is a Federal building with a hallway that is accessible only to somebody who has a code key. Would that be -- is that -- does that have to be disclosed under FOIA? Or architectural plans for a Federal building that would disclose the size of the bomb that would be necessary to bring the building down or bring part of the building down; is there any FOIA exemption that covers things like that? Do you have any reason to -- just out of curiosity, do you have any reason to believe that the current version of the ESQD map is different from the one that was published in the newspaper previously? There is a document on the FBI web site called ""Security clearance process for state and local law enforcement. "" which seems to address exactly the situation in which there is a need to -- it says: ""It is the policy of the Federal Bureau Of Investigation to share with law enforcement personnel pertinent information regarding terrorism. "" ""And it provides a procedure for sharing that classified information. "" Do you think it's practical to classify all of the information that might have security implications? Architectural designs, passwords. Could I just nail down one particular point?

For example, suppose some very distinguished physicians concluded based on clinical trials that there was a connection between a drug and a very serious side effect. Could that establish materiality?

Suppose that it's alleged that ten million people during -- during -- during 1 year have taken a particular drug and five people shortly after taking the drug have developed certain -- have had an adverse -- have had -- experienced an adverse event. Is that sufficient to go to a jury? Now we're told that there are hundreds of thousands of these; for a -- for a typical drug there may be thousands of these adverse event reports in -- in a year, and you're -- basically you're saying all of those have to be disclosed?

All that's alleged is that a very large number of people took the drug and that three people, after taking the drug, within a week developed a certain syndrome. That's the first one. Is that enough for materiality? The second one is that a company receives a telephone call: Hello, I'm a general practitioner from wherever, and I treated a patient and the patient took your medication and shortly after that developed this syndrome, and I think there might be a connection. All right. This drug, let's say it's a drug to relieve the common cold and the effect is loss of the sense of smell. Five million people take it. Three people, after taking it, lose their sense of smell. Is that enough for materiality by itself? What if the company makes the kind of relatively common statements that were made here, poised for growth in the upcoming season, very strong momentum going into the season, extremely well positioned for successful season? That -- that triggers the duty to disclose the satanic rumors?

2010,Ashcroft v. Al-Kidd,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, in light of these restrictions, I would like to come back to the question that I understood Justice Scalia to be asking. If the Court were to hold that obtaining a material witness warrant does not violate the Fourth Amendment where the statutory requirements, and in particular establishing materiality, are met, why would it be necessary for the Court to decide whether there's absolute immunity when a prosecutor seeks a material witness warrant? Is this a -- is this a realistic hypothetical that you've posed? Now, in order to detain someone under the material witness statute, that person, potential witness, must have material testimony, not just relevant testimony, material testimony, testimony that would be of some importance in the criminal prosecution. So your hypothetical is a situation in which there is a witness and this witness has important testimony that could be used in a pending criminal case, and yet the prosecution has absolutely no interest in calling that person as a witness. How often is that going to arise? Your argument is that the Constitution does not allow a material witness to be detained, so long as the witness says in court that he or she will show up for trial, no matter how much evidence there is that this person poses a great risk of flight? If the person says in court, I will be there, that's the end of it, the person cannot be detained? Yes. You might turn out-- --You don't think that an official reading all this Court's cases saying subjective motivation is not proper in determining the application of the Fourth Amendment would be able to think that this would apply here, too? Subjective motivation doesn't count here; what counts is whether there's -- there are objective criteria that would permit the detention? You seem to acknowledge that in -- a dual motive case would not violate the Fourth Amendment, or wouldn't necessarily violate the Fourth Amendment; isn't that right? Do you think that a reasonable official would appreciate, well, it's okay for me to have a dual motive, but I have to stop and think: Is my interest in investigating this individual further the but-for cause of my desire to get a material witness warrant? Do you think that was apparent? Where did you allege that the desire to detain was the sole motive for this? We're dealing here with a Bivens action? Under what theory is the history of immunity at some point in the 19th century relevant to the scope of the immunity that should be available in a -- in a Bivens action? What's the theory for that? Does that make any sense? I can understand it with respect to 1983, on the theory that when Congress passed the predecessor of that statute it implicitly intended to adopt the immunities that were available at the time; but when this Court invented the Bivens claim -- in when -- 1971 or whatever -- that the Court -- the Court was -- committed itself to recognizing only those immunities that were available at the time when 1983 was adopted? ",well in light of these restriction i would like to come back to the question that i understand justice scalia to be ask if the court we be to hold that obtain a material witness warrant do not violate the fourth amendment where the statutory requirement and in particular establish materiality be meet why would it be necessary for the court to decide whether there be absolute immunity when a prosecutor seek a material witness warrant be this a be this a realistic hypothetical that you have pose now in order to detain someone under the material witness statute that person potential witness must have material testimony not just relevant testimony material testimony testimony that would be of some importance in the criminal prosecution so your hypothetical be a situation in which there be a witness and this witness have important testimony that could be use in a pending criminal case and yet the prosecution have absolutely no interest in call that person as a witness how often be that go to arise your argument be that the constitution do not allow a material witness to be detain so long as the witness say in court that he or she will show up for trial no matter how much evidence there be that this person pose a great risk of flight if the person say in court i will be there that be the end of it the person can not be detain yes you might turn out you do not think that an official reading all this court s case say subjective motivation be not proper in determine the application of the fourth amendment would be able to think that this would apply here too subjective motivation do not count here what count be whether there be there be objective criterion that would permit the detention you seem to acknowledge that in a dual motive case would not violate the fourth amendment or would not necessarily violate the fourth amendment be not that right do you think that a reasonable official would appreciate well it be okay for me to have a dual motive but i have to stop and think be my interest in investigate this individual far the but for because of my desire to get a material witness warrant do you think that be apparent where do you allege that the desire to detain be the sole motive for this we be deal here with a bivens action under what theory be the history of immunity at some point in the th century relevant to the scope of the immunity that should be available in a in a bivens action what be the theory for that do that make any sense i can understand it with respect to on the theory that when congress pass the predecessor of that statute it implicitly intend to adopt the immunity that we be available at the time but when this court invent the bivens claim in when or whatever that the court the court be commit itself to recognize only those immunity that we be available at the time when be adopt ,189.46000000000004,Roberts Court,"Mar 2, 2011",John Ashcroft,Abdullah al-Kidd,10-98,"Oct 18, 2010","May 31, 2011",112,1.0,1.0,1.0,1
2010,Schindler Elevator Corp. v. United States ex rel. Kirk,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","But is the question whether the documents that are turned over themselves reports or whether they are included in a report? I thought what (e)(4) said was that you -- you determine whether it is in a congressional administrative or accounting office report. So that, suppose the Department of Labor issued what everybody would concede is a report and appended to that certain documents, wouldn't those documents be in the report, even though they are not the report themselves? Well, could we talk about the test that you propose? You say that a report is a usually formal account of the results of an investigation given by a group or person authorized to make it, right? And then an investigation is most reasonably understood as an official probe into fraudulent conduct. So if the report does not investigate fraudulent conduct, then it isn't -- if something does not involve information about fraudulent conduct, it's not a report? Well, could I ask you about a document to which your adversary referred? The Department of Justice and all of the other departments are required annually to issue what are termed Freedom of Information Act reports. Now, is that a report-- --under the False Claims Act? But this report is -- doesn't seem to involve a process that's any less mechanical than responding to a FOIA report. It's basically a compilation of statistics: how many requests were filed, how long it took to process them, exemptions that were claimed, and so forth. So what's the difference? Well, I -- I understood the definition that I read to be the position that you are advocating, not simply some dictionary -- some definition that happens to appear in the dictionary. I understood that to be the test that you were saying we should adopt. Am I wrong? Did I misread your brief? But if we adopt your definition, isn't it true that a lot of things that are labeled Department of Labor report, Justice Department Freedom of Information Act report, are not reports? So you're withdrawing from the definition that you proposed in your brief? Well, may I ask you why a FOIA response doesn't satisfy the Second Circuit's test? An investigation, the Court says, quote, ""implies a more focused and sustained inquiry toward a government end. "" Now, the government end in responding to a FOIA request is compliance with FOIA, and somebody has to search for these records and determine whether any exemptions apply, and that would seem to be focused and sustained. So what element is missing? How do you determine which government ends count and which government ends don't count? That's the only government -- compliance with FOIA is the only government end that doesn't count? So a report that goes to a department or agency's compliance with some law that is not directly related to the mission of that department, that would qualify as a -- as a government end for these purposes, but FOIA's the only thing that doesn't count? Your test, am I right -- this is page 21 of your brief -- that it has to go to the uncovering of the truth of the matter or inquiring into wrongdoing. Is that your test? Isn't the test whether -- the test is whether there's a substantive analysis of facts? So -- but when the -- when the DOJ pulls together at the end of the fiscal year the number of FOIA requests that it received and calculates the length of time they were pending and discloses that in the annual freedom of act -- Freedom of Information Act report, that is a report? Every report is a mean -- means of public disclosure. Does -- the Freedom of Information Act report is a means of public disclosure, that's the reason that Congress required it. But I'm -- I'm still struggling to find out what the definition is of -- of a report or an investigation. You say it's a substantive analysis of facts. Does not the person who processes a FOIA request have to engage in a substantive analysis of facts to determine whether particular documents fall within the scope of the request, whether certain materials are covered by exemptions? ",but be the question whether the document that be turn over themselves report or whether they be include in a report i think what e say be that you you determine whether it be in a congressional administrative or accounting office report so that suppose the department of labor issue what everybody would concede be a report and append to that certain document would not those document be in the report even though they be not the report themselves well could we talk about the test that you propose you say that a report be a usually formal account of the result of an investigation give by a group or person authorize to make it right and then an investigation be most reasonably understood as an official probe into fraudulent conduct so if the report do not investigate fraudulent conduct then it be not if something do not involve information about fraudulent conduct it be not a report well could i ask you about a document to which your adversary refer the department of justice and all of the other department be require annually to issue what be term freedom of information act report now be that a report under the false claim act but this report be do not seem to involve a process that be any less mechanical than respond to a foia report it be basically a compilation of statistic how many request we be file how long it take to process them exemption that we be claim and so forth so what be the difference well i i understand the definition that i read to be the position that you be advocate not simply some dictionary some definition that happen to appear in the dictionary i understand that to be the test that you we be say we should adopt be i wrong do i misread your brief but if we adopt your definition be not it true that a lot of thing that be label department of labor report justice department freedom of information act report be not report so you be withdraw from the definition that you propose in your brief well may i ask you why a foia response do not satisfy the second circuit s test an investigation the court say quote imply a more focused and sustain inquiry toward a government end now the government end in respond to a foia request be compliance with foia and somebody have to search for these record and determine whether any exemption apply and that would seem to be focus and sustain so what element be miss how do you determine which government end count and which government end do not count that be the only government compliance with foia be the only government end that do not count so a report that go to a department or agency s compliance with some law that be not directly relate to the mission of that department that would qualify as a as a government end for these purpose but foia s the only thing that do not count your test be i right this be page of your brief that it have to go to the uncovering of the truth of the matter or inquire into wrongdoing be that your test be not the test whether the test be whether there be a substantive analysis of fact so but when the when the doj pull together at the end of the fiscal year the number of foia request that it receive and calculate the length of time they we be pending and discloses that in the annual freedom of act freedom of information act report that be a report every report be a mean mean of public disclosure do the freedom of information act report be a mean of public disclosure that be the reason that congress require it but I be I be still struggle to find out what the definition be of of a report or an investigation you say it be a substantive analysis of fact do not the person who process a foia request have to engage in a substantive analysis of fact to determine whether particular document fall within the scope of the request whether certain material be cover by exemption ,242.70000000000005,Roberts Court,"Mar 1, 2011",Schindler Elevator Corporation,United States ex re.

2010,Freeman v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","You quote one definition of -- the noun ""base"" in your brief uses a point from which something can develop, but you omit another standard definition of the term, the principal element or -- or ingredient of anything, considered as its fundamental part. Why do you do that? Well, there's two -- there are two different definitions. One is something that provides a starting point for analysis. The other is the fundamental thing on which something is -- it rests. Now, if you use the latter definition, you have to decide which is more fundamental here, the agreement between the parties or the sentencing guidelines, which certainly provided the starting point for the analysis of the sentence by the -- by the district court. Well, wouldn't the guidelines, even in that situation, provide the starting point for analysis? Isn't the district court obligated, and isn't the -- doesn't the presentence report have to go through the guidelines calculation before the sentence is imposed? So you start out with the -- the guideline sentence of whatever the figure was that you mentioned, and then you go from there, and maybe you depart downward. So why wouldn't that be based on the guidelines? Just because there's such a big downward departure? Well, in every case, they have to go through the guidelines calculation, and the parties have the opportunity to object to the calculation, right? So what does paragraph 12 of the plea agreement contribute here, other than with respect to the fine and things besides the sentence that we're talking about? It doesn't seem to me to add anything substantively. What if there had been evidence here of that? What if the government in connection with this plea agreement had dropped counts or had decided not to seek a superseding indictment adding counts? Would -- would the situation be the same? How would that possibly work? Let's say the government drops count -- agrees to a plea on count 1 with a guideline range of 60 to 65 months; drops count 2, which would have increased the guideline range to, let's say, 100 to 105 months; and says this is our deal, you know, you agree to -- to 65 months and we're going to drop count 2. All right? And then the guideline for that is lowered, and you say in determining whether the defendant is eligible, what -- the government would then have to have a mini-trial and prove that the -- prove count 2? How would it work? Right. Right. MR. HEFT -- guideline range would be reduced, and then, as the district judge in this case said, if you have objections, let me know; file your objections. That's where the government could file-- --Yes. The government files its objections and says, well, we dropped count 2. And the defendant says, well, I wasn't guilty of count 2. How is the judge going to decide that? Why doesn't this line of questioning lead logically to the conclusion that no sentence after Booker and Fanfan is based on the guidelines? Because, today, a sentencing judge can engage in the same analysis that the Sentencing Commission may engage in when it decides that a guideline range should be lowered and that that should be retroactive. The judge can do that at the time when the sentence is imposed. We roll the clock back on the crack -- on the crack cocaine guidelines. Under the authority that judges now have under Booker and Fanfan, a judge could say, well, I see that this is the crack cocaine guideline right now, but I think it is too harsh for all the reasons that were later persuasive in lowering the range, and therefore, I am sentencing below the range. So it seems to lead logically to the conclusion that 3582 is yet another provision of the Sentencing Reform Act that was tied to the old pre-Booker mandatory sentencing regime, and now that that is out the window with Booker and Fanfan, the whole -- the whole mechanism is -- is superfluous. Well, I find it hard to -- I find it hard to understand the analysis that would require courts to decide whether some (c)(1)(C) plea agreements are based on the guidelines and some are not based on the guidelines. Maybe they are all based on the guidelines, and then the obligation would be on the government to put a provision in a standard plea agreement requiring the defendant to give up the opportunity to move for a sentence reduction if the guideline range is subsequently lowered. Or maybe none of them are based on the guidelines because -- for the reasons I just mentioned: This whole mechanism is now needed no longer as a result of Booker and Fanfan. ",you quote one definition of the noun base in your brief use a point from which something can develop but you omit another standard definition of the term the principal element or or ingredient of anything consider as its fundamental part why do you do that well there be two there be two different definition one be something that provide a starting point for analysis the other be the fundamental thing on which something be it rest now if you use the latter definition you have to decide which be more fundamental here the agreement between the party or the sentencing guideline which certainly provide the starting point for the analysis of the sentence by the by the district court well would not the guideline even in that situation provide the starting point for analysis be not the district court obligate and be not the do not the presentence report have to go through the guideline calculation before the sentence be impose so you start out with the the guideline sentence of whatever the figure be that you mention and then you go from there and maybe you depart downward so why would not that be base on the guideline just because there be such a big downward departure well in every case they have to go through the guideline calculation and the party have the opportunity to object to the calculation right so what do paragraph of the plea agreement contribute here other than with respect to the fine and thing besides the sentence that we be talk about it do not seem to me to add anything substantively what if there have be evidence here of that what if the government in connection with this plea agreement have drop count or have decide not to seek a superseding indictment add count would would the situation be the same how would that possibly work let us say the government drop count agree to a plea on count with a guideline range of to month drop count which would have increase the guideline range to let us say to month and say this be our deal you know you agree to to month and we be go to drop count all right and then the guideline for that be lower and you say in determine whether the defendant be eligible what the government would then have to have a mini trial and prove that the prove count how would it work right right mr heft guideline range would be reduce and then as the district judge in this case say if you have objection let me know file your objection that be where the government could file yes the government file its objection and say well we drop count and the defendant say well i be not guilty of count how be the judge go to decide that why do not this line of question lead logically to the conclusion that no sentence after booker and fanfan be base on the guideline because today a sentence judge can engage in the same analysis that the sentence commission may engage in when it decide that a guideline range should be lower and that that should be retroactive the judge can do that at the time when the sentence be impose we roll the clock back on the crack on the crack cocaine guideline under the authority that judge now have under booker and fanfan a judge could say well i see that this be the crack cocaine guideline right now but i think it be too harsh for all the reason that we be later persuasive in lower the range and therefore i be sentence below the range so it seem to lead logically to the conclusion that be yet another provision of the sentence reform act that be tie to the old pre booker mandatory sentencing regime and now that that be out the window with booker and fanfan the whole the whole mechanism be be superfluous well i find it hard to i find it hard to understand the analysis that would require court to decide whether some c c plea agreement be base on the guideline and some be not base on the guideline maybe they be all base on the guideline and then the obligation would be on the government to put a provision in a standard plea agreement require the defendant to give up the opportunity to move for a sentence reduction if the guideline range be subsequently lower or maybe none of them be base on the guideline because for the reason i just mention this whole mechanism be now need no longer as a result of booker and fanfan ,277.2,Roberts Court,"Feb 23, 2011",William Freeman,United States,09-10245,"Sep 28, 2010","Jun 23, 2011",112,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

Now, the Federal claim is handled in the same way that it was here. It's found to be frivolous. Would not the defendants be entitled to all of the time that they spent preparing for the Federal court case? You're proceeding on the assumption which I -- I think is certainly, based on what I know of the record, true here, that the State claims are far from frivolous. But how is -- let's take another case, where it isn't clear whether the State claims are any more meritorious than the Federal claim. Then how is the Federal judge supposed to handle the -- the calculation of attorney's fees in the separate Federal suit? Yes. Well, the facts are -- the facts are intertwined, but they're two separate cases. You have claims of unknown merit in State court; you have a frivolous claim in Federal court. What if the potential liability on the frivolous claim is much greater than the potential liability on the factually interrelated nonfrivolous claims, and the defense argues that we spent a lot of time on -- a lot more time on these interrelated factual issues because of our fear of the greater liability on them than the frivolous claim? How do you reconcile the test that the Fifth Circuit said it was applying, which is -- seems to be a but-for test, with the fees that were actually awarded here? Can I ask you a question I asked Mr. Rosenkranz? Here, the argument seems to proceed on the assumption that the State law claims are not frivolous and may well be meritorious, but suppose that the Federal Court was in no position to make that determination at the time of the remand. What is the Federal Court to do then? If the Fifth's Circuit's statement -- if the Fifth Circuit's statement of the test it was applying is correct, would you say that that is a discretionary determination?

2010,Michigan v. Bryant,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","In a situation like this, do you think it's meaningful to ask what the primary purpose of the victim was when he responded to the police and said who shot him? You have a man who has just been shot. He has a wound that's going to turn out to be fatal, and he's lying there on the ground bleeding profusely, and he says: My primary purpose in saying this is so they can respond to an ongoing emergency? No, but I also have the purpose of giving them information that could be used at trial, but it's a little less -- that's a little bit less my purpose than responding to the ongoing emergency. It seems like it's totally artificial. But we established that this was a dying declaration and was made in contemplation of death, would it be barred by Crawford? I understand that, but assume for the sake of argument that it would be consistent with Crawford if it were a dying declaration, which the Court has suggested. What does that tell you about the understanding of the scope of the confrontation right at the time when the Sixth Amendment was adopted? Because a dying declaration may very well be testimonial under -- is likely to be testimonial under the Crawford test. Can there be-- --Can there be a situation in which the primary purpose for a statement or for the question that elicits the statement is to respond to an ongoing emergency rather than to gather evidence for subsequent use in a legal proceeding when the statement relates to something that has occurred, perhaps just a few seconds before, but it relates to something that has occurred as opposed to something that is occurring at that very moment? But I understand, but we need to know where to draw the line. So, you concede that the line is not between a statement about he is hitting me with a baseball bat as opposed to he just finished hitting me with a baseball bat and is headed out the door? That is not where the line is drawn. I really would like a clear answer to this. Is -- can there be an ongoing emergency where the statement relates -- where the statement recounts something that has occurred, not something that is occurring? Well, suppose they get a 9-1-1 call. There's -- a man has just been shot on the corner of Fifth and Main. They go to Fifth and Main; they find a man there; he's shot; he's bleeding profusely; he's in shock; and they know nothing more about what's happened. And they say, well, what happened? Well, he shot me. Who shot you? It's John Jones. Now what about that? Well, the police under those circumstances don't know whether John Jones is going on a shooting spree; this is just the first of numerous victims. Maybe it's a gang fight. He's shot one member of an opposing gang; now he's going to go shoot another member of an opposing gang. How can they -- how can you answer that question, what's the primary purpose there? I just don't understand it. Well, I'm still trying to understand your conception of the scope of the ongoing emergency doctrine. Would it be fair to say that your idea is that the police have to have specific evidence that there is an immediate threat of physical violence that they need to respond to, in order for the ongoing emergency doctrine to apply? And in a case of doubt they can't do it. So if they don't know whether there is an immediate threat or not an immediate threat then that doesn't fall within that exception; that's your idea? I thought you just said that wasn't the test, past versus present. Didn't you say that about 10 minutes ago, it's not the difference between something that is taking place and something that has taken place? The witness has to say there is an emergency? There is a report of shooting at a school, and the police go and they find two students lying on the ground. One is dead and the other is severely wounded and they ask the one who is wounded did it. ""It's John Jones"". Now does that -- is that an ongoing emergency? No. Why is it not an ongoing emergency? What would be an ongoing emergency? That is a very specific information. What if there are three students who have been shot, four students who have been shot, but nobody says, well, I think he's still in the building, he may have an interest in shooting some more students? Of course that's the emergency. Because how are they going to find the person that they are looking for if they don't know who it is. What if he's thrown away his gun? Of course if they come upon him and he has the gun in his hand, then it's not a question. What if he has disposed of it? They have to know who to go for. I'm totally puzzled now as to when you think there is an ongoing emergency and when there isn't. You made by the Declarant. It can't be inferred from the circumstances.

2010,Snyder v. Phelps,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Is there anything to suggest that the Maryland legislature, in enacting that statute, intended to occupy the field of regulations of events that occur at funerals? Do you think that the epic is relevant as an explanation of some of the these arguably ambiguous signs that were displayed at the funeral? For example, ""You are going to hell"", ""God hates you""; who is ""you""? If you read the epic, perhaps that sheds light on who ""you"" is. Well, yes, but the signs say ""you"" and the argument is made ""you"" doesn't mean Matthew Snyder; it means a larger group. And then you have the epic, which is directed directly at Matthew Snyder. Doesn't that show -- shed light on what ""you"" meant on those signs? Is this the situation in which all conduct that complies with the Maryland funeral protest statute is lawful? If the Maryland legislature said this is the -- these are the exclusive regulations that apply here, so that if someone came up to Mr. Phelps at the funeral and spat in his face, that would not be -- that wouldn't be illegal? Because it's not specifically prohibited by the statute. Is it your -- is it your argument that the First Amendment never allows a claim for the intentional infliction of emotional distress based on speech unless the speech is such that it can be proven to be false or true? Is that your argument? All right. Well, Justice Kagan gave you one example. Let me give you another example along the same lines. Let's say there is a grandmother who has raised a son who was killed in Afghanistan or in Iraq by an IED. And she goes to visit her son's -- her grandson's grave, and she's waiting to take a bus back to her home. And while she's at the bus stop, someone approaches and speaks to her in the most vile terms about her son: He was killed by an IED; do you know what IEDs do? Let me describe it for you, and I am so happy that this happened; I only wish I were there; I only wish that I could have taken pictures of it. And on and on. Now, is that protected by the First Amendment? There is no false statement involved and it's purely speech. Well, it's an elderly person. She's really probably not in -- in a position to punch this person in the nose. Well, if there -- if that -- there is a possibility there is a claim there, then what distinguishes that from this case? Now, I thought you were beginning to say that my hypothetical is different because Mr. Snyder made his son into a public figure; and the question I wanted to ask in that connection is whether every bereaved family member who provides information to a local newspaper for an obituary thereby makes the deceased person a public figure? But if the grandmother called up the local paper and said, let me tell you something about my grandson-- --who was just killed in Iraq. You know, he liked football and camping. That makes him -- that makes her a public figure? But your argument depends on the proposition that this is speech on a matter of public concern, is that correct? So let me -- let me give you this example. Suppose someone believes that African Americans are inferior, they are inherently inferior, and they are really a bad influence on this country. And so a person comes up to an African-American and starts berating that person with racial hatred. Now is that in -- this is just any old person on -- any old African-American on the street. That's a matter of public concern? Why aren't the members of the family -- why aren't the members of the family of the deceased a captive audience at the funeral? I thought the targeted picketing of a person's house is not protected by the First Amendment. What's the difference between that and picketing around the site of the funeral? So it doesn't have to do with whether this is a -- what you characterize as a public funeral as opposed to a private funeral? That is not the distinction you are relying upon any longer? What if a parent is called after the -- puts in the obituary information and called by the local newspaper and asked for a comment, and he says or she says, I'm proud of my son because he died in the service of our country. Does that -- is he stepping into a public debate by doing that? ",be there anything to suggest that the maryland legislature in enact that statute intend to occupy the field of regulation of event that occur at funeral do you think that the epic be relevant as an explanation of some of the these arguably ambiguous sign that we be display at the funeral for example you be go to hell god hat you who be you if you read the epic perhaps that shed light on who you be well yes but the sign say you and the argument be make you do not mean matthew snyder it mean a large group and then you have the epic which be direct directly at matthew snyder do not that show she would light on what you mean on those sign be this the situation in which all conduct that comply with the maryland funeral protest statute be lawful if the maryland legislature say this be the these be the exclusive regulation that apply here so that if someone come up to mr phelps at the funeral and spat in his face that would not be that would not be illegal because it be not specifically prohibit by the statute be it your be it your argument that the first amendment never allow a claim for the intentional infliction of emotional distress base on speech unless the speech be such that it can be prove to be false or true be that your argument all right well justice kagan give you one example let me give you another example along the same line let us say there be a grandmother who have raise a son who be kill in afghanistan or in iraq by an ied and she go to visit her son s her grandson s grave and she be wait to take a bus back to her home and while she be at the bus stop someone approach and speaks to her in the most vile term about her son he be kill by an ied do you know what ieds do let me describe it for you and i be so happy that this happen i only wish i we be there i only wish that i could have take picture of it and on and on now be that protect by the first amendment there be no false statement involve and it be purely speech well it be an elderly person she be really probably not in in a position to punch this person in the nose well if there if that there be a possibility there be a claim there then what distinguish that from this case now i think you we be begin to say that my hypothetical be different because mr snyder make his son into a public figure and the question i want to ask in that connection be whether every bereave family member who provide information to a local newspaper for an obituary thereby make the deceased person a public figure but if the grandmother call up the local paper and say let me tell you something about my grandson who be just kill in iraq you know he like football and camping that make him that make her a public figure but your argument depend on the proposition that this be speech on a matter of public concern be that correct so let me let me give you this example suppose someone believe that african american be inferior they be inherently inferior and they be really a bad influence on this country and so a person come up to an african american and start berate that person with racial hatred now be that in this be just any old person on any old african american on the street that be a matter of public concern why be not the member of the family why be not the member of the family of the decease a captive audience at the funeral i think the targeted picketing of a person s house be not protect by the first amendment what be the difference between that and picket around the site of the funeral so it do not have to do with whether this be a what you characterize as a public funeral as oppose to a private funeral that be not the distinction you be rely upon any long what if a parent be call after the put in the obituary information and call by the local newspaper and ask for a comment and he say or she say I be proud of my son because he die in the service of our country do that be he step into a public debate by do that ,271.43,Roberts Court,"Oct 6, 2010",Albert Snyder,"Fred W.

2010,Bond v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Can't there be some Tenth Amendment claims that go just to State prerogatives and not to the rights of individuals? Let's say there's a Federal statute that purports to regulate where a State locates its capital, or the -- the contents of a State flag, something like that. Wouldn't that go just to State prerogatives and not to individual rights? Well, the problem is if you're just making a treaty power claim, then how are you going to possibly win on remand in the Third Circuit if we reverse and say that your -- your client has standing? Do you think it falls within the prerogatives of the court of appeals to say that Missouri v. Holland was wrong? Does that depend on the nature of the chemical that's involved? Suppose the chemical was -- was something that people would normally understand as the kind of chemical that would be used in a chemical weapon? Let's say it's Sarin does it matter that this case doesn't involve something like that? Well, what if they argue -- what if she argues on remand, if there is a remand, that, assuming for the sake of argument Congress can enact any law that is necessary and proper to implement a treaty? The Tenth Amendment prohibits certain laws that intrude too heavily on State law enforcement prerogatives, State police power. If she makes that argument, which category does that fall into? I don't know whether that's a correct characterization of the argument that was made in -- in the Tennessee Electric case. I -- I'm looking at the brief in the case, and the discussion of the Tenth Amendment generally follows a caption that says the power to dispose of Federal property does not include any power to regulate local activities. I don't understand why that isn't the same kind of delegated powers argument that you say the Petitioner here is raising. Given the breadth of this statute, that would be a very far-reaching decision, wouldn't it? Suppose that the Petitioner in this case decided to retaliate against her former friend by pouring a bottle of vinegar in the friend's goldfish bowl. As I read this statute, that would be a violation of this statute, potentially punishable by life imprisonment, wouldn't it? If she possesses a chemical weapon. Well, a chemical weapon is a weapon that includes toxic chemicals. And a toxic chemical is a chemical that can cause death to animals. And pouring vinegar in a goldfish bowl, I believe, will cause death to the goldfish, so that's -- that's a chemical weapon. The difference is that Raich involved one commodity, right? Marijuana. This involves potentially thousands and thousands of chemicals. And you would have -- you would make the same argument with respect to every one of those chemicals if you take together all of the people who are -- who would use vinegar to kill goldfish or all the people who might use antifreeze to kill dogs, you put all of that together, that has a substantial effect on the interstate, the interstate market for antifreeze or for vinegar? That would be the argument? I'm not sure I -- I'm not sure I understood what you just said. Are you saying that -- that she is arguing that Congress does not have the power to enact legislation that's necessary and proper for the implementation of treaties, but only for the making of treaties; that she's making that argument that's been made by some academic writers?

2010,Arizona Free Enterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Would there be anything unconstitutional about a system that worked roughly like this? At the beginning -- at some point prior to each election cycle, the commission that supervises this law would make a calculation about how much money would be needed for a candidate in a gubernatorial race or a State senate race or an assembly race, if that's what it's called in Arizona, to get that candidate's message out to the electorate, and that would be the amount of the public funding, period. Suppose the -- suppose the Court after this argument sent you a letter saying if you would like to file an additional brief, you have the opportunity to do so, and we're not going to allow your opponent to file a brief. Would you take advantage of that opportunity? Now, if we said you can file an extra brief, but if you do that your opponent will also be able to file an extra brief. Would that figure in your thinking? Well, there are States that have public funding without having a matching fund provision. I would appreciate it if you would compare these two regimes. The first is exactly what Arizona has now. The second is exactly what Arizona has now minus the matching fund provision. So under the second one you have very strict contribution limits, and you have reporting of all contributions. Now, why does the addition of the matching fund provision serve an anticorruption interest? But even if it is the case that those candidates who choose not to participate are willing to spend additional money even though it triggers matching funds, I don't see what that proves. A candidate who is deciding whether to participate or not presumably makes a calculation at the beginning: Do I want to spend more than the matching fund amount, even though I know that if I do that, the other side will get additional money? Now, if they say, no, I don't -- I'm not going to do it under those circumstances, they will take the public financing. And if they choose the private financing, it means they probably made a decision going in that they're going to -- they're going to be one of those who is willing to suffer the consequences of spending over the amount. So I don't see what this -- I don't see what that proves. Could I ask a question that goes back to Justice Kennedy's question, which I don't think you fully had a chance to -- or fully answered? And that has to do with the independent expenditures. Let's say there are two candidates running for governor, and one who is a participating candidate is taking a position on a very controversial Arizona issue with which I disagree, and the other is a non-participating candidate who is taking a position on that controversial issue and I agree with that. Now, if I choose to run an ad, pay for an ad supporting the non-participating candidate, I know that the -- the candidate that I dislike on that issue is going to get an additional amount of funds, and -- but if I choose to run an ad supporting the participating candidate, the opposite doesn't happen. Now, why isn't that a clear-cut discrimination based on the content of speech? But if I'm the independent -- if I'm the independent expenditure maker, I haven't made a choice at the beginning. I haven't decided to participate or not participate. What I care about is the issue that's being debated between these two candidates. But would you agree that the matching fund provision by itself does not serve an anticorruption purpose? What you just said was that this law aims to allow publicly financed candidates to run on the same footing as privately financed candidates; isn't that right? Right, and that's equal-- --that's equal -- that's leveling the playing field, isn't it?

2010,Camreta v. Greene,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Mr. Camreta would be protected. He would presumably still be entitled to qualified immunity because a vacated alternative holding certainly could not really establish something, I would assume. But municipalities, if they continue to participate in -- in questioning of this nature, would not be protected; isn't that right? But you want to have the Fourth Amendment decision preserved and have it govern an enormous chunk of the country so that all the States in the Ninth Circuit have to comply with it, and anybody -- any individual officer who doesn't comply with it would do so on pain of personal liability, but you don't want that ground-breaking decision to be subject to review by this Court on the merits. Is that a summary of what you want? Does that make any sense? What is there in the Ninth Circuit's opinion, which -- which generally requires a warrant, to suggest that the length of the interrogation was relevant to their decision? I mean, at least the child protective services need to decide whether they need a warrant before they begin the questioning, no matter how long it's going to last. Where does it say that the length is relevant to the -- to the issue that they decided? On the issue-- --Well, on the issue of consent, do you read the Ninth Circuit's opinion as having an age limit? Suppose that the child is, let's say, 16 years old. Is the child at 16 incapable of consenting to questioning? But what is your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question, suppose it was just Mr. Camreta or suppose it was the school nurse, would the answer be the same? So if it was just Mr. Camreta and he-- --and he taped the conversation and then later turned it over to the -- to the police if he discovered evidence of child abuse, there would be no problem? Right? Well, could you have cross-petitioned in an effort to get damages, so if you had wanted to preserve the issue, you surely could have done that, couldn't you? If you were designing what you would regard as an ideal system, and you're very knowledgeable in this -- in this area, and you concluded that some kind of approval by a detached individual should be required before something like this is allowed, would you set the standard at probable cause?

What sense does it make to exclude the weekend? Does this-- --Do these flights of prisoners from one facility to another come to a stop when -- you know, when the whistle blows on Saturday -- on Friday afternoon?

How would you grade the chances of the Court taking cert on that? If I could just come back to where you started before you go on to these additional points. Your argument is that if the Government petitions for cert on one issue that's a legal issue on which there's a conflict in the circuits and the Respondent in a criminal case says that the -- asks to have the decision below affirmed on 15 other grounds, we -- and raises those in the bio, we take the case anyway, we are duty-bound to decide every one of those 15 grounds?

Didn't think about -- okay. Well, why aren't they trying -- why isn't the effect of what you're doing to prompt us to dismiss this case that the petitioner has improvidently granted? If we were to write an opinion that says that the -- the Sixth Circuit was wrong in its interpretation of subsection (f), and therefore, we're not going to get to -- and anything we then had to say about subsection (d) is just dictum, and that's the issue that we took the case to decide, why should we keep the case at all?

Then there's no liability. When I look at the language of the statute, I see no scienter requirement whatsoever. Whoever actively induces infringement of the patent -- infringement is strict liability. So if you actively induce somebody to engage in conduct constituting infringement, you're -- you're liable as an inducer. You have intent, but intent to do what? What difference does that make? Because making, using, and selling equals infringement. Well, I don't see that. And not only that, I don't understand why the scienter requirement for inducing should be higher than the scienter requirement for a direct infringement. Isn't the standard rule for aiding and abetting that the aider and abetter -- if (b) is an aiding and abetting provision, as one of the congressional reports said, the -- the scienter for aiding and abetting is the scienter of the underlying offense? So if the underlying offense is a strict liability offense, then the inducement should be strict liability as well. If this is not willful blindness, I don't know what willful blindness is. Now, maybe you can explain what more would have been required to permit a reasonable jury to find willful blindness. But your client -- I don't know whether you're using your time most effectively by arguing this point, but your client thought that making a deep fryer that wouldn't burn people's hands if they touched it would be profitable, because there wasn't a lot of competition in that market.

Because that was the only -- that was what -- that was the error, the alleged error that was identified by Mr. Dunnegan. So if he is wrong on that, then the judgment should be affirmed.

2010,"Thompson v. North American Stainless, LP",112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","The question is whether he's aggrieved within the meaning of Title VII. And your argument is that if there is injury, in fact, sufficient to satisfy Article III of the Constitution, then the person is aggrieved. Is it your argument that we have -- that we should go that far? We don't need to go that far? Where do we draw the line? Where does that come from? Where does that test come from? I understand the argument. I don't really -- it's not too helpful, at least to me, to say, as far as we need to go in order to reverse. That's really not how the statute ought to be interpreted, I would say. What does it mean? Now, I understand the argument that ""aggrieved"" means all the way to what's -- all that's necessary is what is necessary to satisfy the Constitution. And I understand that argument. It's a very broad argument with a lot of implications. But if that's not correct, then what is the correct test and where does it come from? Suppose Thompson were not Regalado's fiancee at the time. Suppose they were just -- they were just good friends. Would -- and everything else happened, and he alleged that he was fired in retaliation for her engaging in protected conduct. The way the company wanted to get at her was by firing her friend. Would that be enough? How does that translate? How does that Burlington Northern standard translate into this situation in which there is some sort of relationship between the -- the person who engaged in the protected conduct and the person who suffers the adverse employment action? That's what's troubling to me about -- about the theory. Where it's a fiancee, it's -- that's a relatively strong case, but I can imagine a whole spectrum of cases in which there is a lesser relationship between those two persons, and if -- if -- if -- unless there's a clear line there someplace, this theory is rather troubling. Can you help -- can you help provide where the clear line is? Does it go -- does it include simply a good friend? Does it include somebody who just has lunch in the cafeteria every day with the person who engaged in the protected conduct? Somebody who once dated the person who engaged in the protected conduct? Are these all questions that have to go to a jury? Put yourself in the -- in the shoes of an employer, and you -- you think -- you want to take an adverse employment action against employee A. You think you have good grounds for doing that, but you want -- before you do it, you want to know whether you're potentially opening yourself up to a retaliation claim. Now, what is the employer supposed to do then? They say, well, let's -- we need to survey everybody who is engaged in protected conduct, and now we need to see whether this person who we're thinking of taking the adverse employment action against has a, quote, unquote, ""close relationship"" with any of those people. So what do you do? Do you call everybody in from the company and you say, now, is -- you know, was -- are these people dating? Did they once date? Are they good friends? What are you supposed to do? I understand that. I do understand that, but I wish you -- I would like you to answer my question. Does the employer have to keep a -- a journal on the intimate or casual relationships between all of its employees, so that it knows what it's -- it's opening itself up to when it wants to take an action against someone? But you're -- you're a reasonable person. What would you say is the degree of closeness that is required? Very good friends is enough?

The officer sees him getting into a car and driving away, even though his license is still suspended. Now, could -- could he be arrested for that? Even though the officer would have no reason to know that this particular person has a suspended license were it not for the chain of events that followed from the initial allegedly illegal stop? All right. Let me ask a related question. Suppose that after you filed your suppression motion the -- the State of New York became nervous about this issue and they checked all the surveillance cameras in the vicinity of the stop, and, lo and behold, they found a tape showing Mr. Tolentino driving the car shortly before the stop here. Could he be prosecuted for illegal -- for driving without a license, with a suspended license, using that evidence? Well, I mean, in light of those two answers, it does seem to me that your real problem here is not with the -- the DMV records. It's with the police officer's observation after the stop that Mr. Tolentino was driving the car. But that's not the argument you seem to be making. You want to suppress the knowledge that the police derived from the stop that Mr. Tolentino's license is suspended, and you would allow an exception to that only if there was attenuation. But why isn't the simpler solution to a case like this that you can't suppress the knowledge of matters that are in a government record, however you can suppress observations by the police on the scene that flow directly from the illegal stop? Suppose that when -- when the police stopped this particular car, they saw that Mr. Tolentino was smoking marijuana or snorting cocaine or drinking from a bottle of alcohol or he had somebody tied up, bound and gagged on the back seat of the car. Now, all of those things would clearly be the fruit -- all those observations would clearly be the fruit of the allegedly illegal stop, right? Even though they were in plain view, they would all be suppressed, right? But you're saying that the observation that Mr. Tolentino is at the wheel of the car, that is not suppressed? Could I go back and-- --Could I go back and ask you to -- to explain what -- how you -- you think the -- the request for suppression of the police officer's observation was waived? That was raised in the motion to suppress, page 17A of the joint appendix. Now, the -- the New York Supreme Court apparently didn't understand that that issue was in the case and ruled only on suppression of the records and tangible evidence, is that right, 78A? What is the -- what is Mr. Tolentino supposed to do at that point to preserve the issue of the suppression of a police officer's observation? The defendant raises an issue before the trial judge, the trial judge ignores that issue, misses the issue-- --and then the defendant waives the issue unless the defendant says by the way, you missed -- you failed to address one of the arguments that I made? It does seem rather strange. That would have been, like, a 10-minute hearing. Why did you stop him? Well, he was playing the music too loud. Defendant testifies, I wasn't playing my music too loud. The trial judge says, Well, I believe you, or I believe you, and that's the end of the matter. It does seem really -- that's how things are done in trial court in New York City? You jump to these big constitutional issues and-- Suppose they -- they -- they break into the house with an axe, and they find out the name, they see this guy is Dagwood, and so they run that through their -- their database, and they find this is the guy we've been looking for, for the last 20 years. He is responsible for all the drugs that come into this country, he's committed numerous acts of terrorism, he's a -- he's a serial killer, he's killed 50 people, we've been chasing him forever, and so the -- the result would be all that knowledge, that this is Dagwood is the fruit of the poisonous tree and nothing can be done about Dagwood? ",suppose that the suppose that that you have win at the trial level the judge suppress everything and dismiss the indictment and mr tolentino walk out of the courtroom and be observe by the officer that conduct the stop in this case the officer see him get into a car and drive away even though his license be still suspend now could could he be arrest for that even though the officer would have no reason to know that this particular person have a suspend license we be it not for the chain of event that follow from the initial allegedly illegal stop all right let me ask a related question suppose that after you file your suppression motion the the state of new york become nervous about this issue and they check all the surveillance camera in the vicinity of the stop and lo and behold they find a tape show mr tolentino drive the car shortly before the stop here could he be prosecute for illegal for drive without a license with a suspended license use that evidence well i mean in light of those two answer it do seem to me that your real problem here be not with the the dmv record it be with the police officer s observation after the stop that mr tolentino be drive the car but that be not the argument you seem to be make you want to suppress the knowledge that the police derive from the stop that mr tolentino s license be suspend and you would allow an exception to that only if there be attenuation but why be not the simpler solution to a case like this that you can not suppress the knowledge of matter that be in a government record however you can suppress observation by the police on the scene that flow directly from the illegal stop suppose that when when the police stop this particular car they saw that mr tolentino be smoke marijuana or snort cocaine or drinking from a bottle of alcohol or he have somebody tie up bound and gag on the back seat of the car now all of those thing would clearly be the fruit all those observation would clearly be the fruit of the allegedly illegal stop right even though they we be in plain view they would all be suppress right but you be say that the observation that mr tolentino be at the wheel of the car that be not suppress could i go back and could i go back and ask you to to explain what how you you think the the request for suppression of the police officer s observation be waive that be raise in the motion to suppress page a of the joint appendix now the the new york supreme court apparently do not understand that that issue be in the case and rule only on suppression of the record and tangible evidence be that right a what be the what be mr tolentino suppose to do at that point to preserve the issue of the suppression of a police officer s observation the defendant raise an issue before the trial judge the trial judge ignore that issue miss the issue and then the defendant waive the issue unless the defendant say by the way you miss you fail to address one of the argument that i make it do seem rather strange that would have be like a minute hearing why do you stop him well he be play the music too loud defendant testifies i be not play my music too loud the trial judge say well i believe you or i believe you and that be the end of the matter it do seem really that be how thing be do in trial court in new york city you jump to these big constitutional issue and suppose they they they break into the house with an axe and they find out the name they see this guy be dagwood and so they run that through their their database and they find this be the guy we have be look for for the last year he be responsible for all the drug that come into this country he be committed numerous act of terrorism he be a he be a serial killer he be kill people we have be chase him forever and so the the result would be all that knowledge that this be dagwood be the fruit of the poisonous tree and nothing can be do about dagwood ,273.51000000000005,Roberts Court,"Mar 21, 2011",Jose Tolentino,New York,09-11556,"Nov 15, 2010","Mar 29, 2011",112,0.0,1.0,0.0,0
2010,Chamber of Commerce of the United States v. Whiting,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Could I ask you this question to get back to the issue of whether this is a licensing law? ""Licensing"" is not an unknown term. States and municipalities issue all sorts of licenses. For example, I think here in the District of Columbia every business has to have a general business license, isn't that right? Now, if the District of Columbia were, after having enacted this requirement some years ago, were to pass a new ordinance saying and ""if you knowingly hire an illegal alien, your general business license can be forfeited. "" would that not -- would that cease to be a licensing law? Doesn't the exception for licensing mean that this isn't going to be completely uniform? One jurisdiction may take the position that a restaurant that employs illegal aliens may lose its restaurant license -- its license to operate. Another one may take a different position. So it's not going to be the same. Isn't there -- isn't there a difference in saying that it may not be used for any purpose other than for enforcement of this chapter and other provisions of Federal law on one hand; and on the other hand saying it may not be used for any purpose other than in a Federal proceeding? The enforcement -- the I-9 certainly could be used in a Federal proceeding by the employer. Would that then -- would that be used for the enforcement of the Federal law? I wouldn't think so. The Federal law and the State law do seem to be exactly the same on this point, but I have -- I don't understand how these two provisions fit together when E-Verify is used. Suppose an employer -- the first thing the employer does is receive the forms from the employee, from the I-9 process. He looks at the forms. Well, they reasonably seem to be authentic. So that employer now has the good faith defense that's provided under -- by the I-9 process, under both Federal law and State law. But under both Federal law and State law, the employee -- employer either must or may also use the e-verification system. The employer gets back a notice of non-authorization. But what -- and that creates, supposedly, a rebuttable presumption under both systems that the employee is not authorized to work. How does that fit together? If you have a complete defense for having used the I-9 process in good faith, the whole e-verification process seems to be irrelevant under both Federal law and State law. I don't understand how they fit together. Well, it's on page 184 to 185 of the appendix petition, isn't it? ",could i ask you this question to get back to the issue of whether this be a licensing law licensing be not an unknown term state and municipality issue all sort of license for example i think here in the district of columbia every business have to have a general business license be not that right now if the district of columbia we be after have enact this requirement some year ago we be to pass a new ordinance say and if you knowingly hire an illegal alien your general business license can be forfeited would that not would that cease to be a licensing law do not the exception for license mean that this be not go to be completely uniform one jurisdiction may take the position that a restaurant that employ illegal alien may lose its restaurant license its license to operate another one may take a different position so it be not go to be the same be not there be not there a difference in say that it may not be use for any purpose other than for enforcement of this chapter and other provision of federal law on one hand and on the other hand say it may not be use for any purpose other than in a federal proceeding the enforcement the i certainly could be use in a federal proceeding by the employer would that then would that be use for the enforcement of the federal law i would not think so the federal law and the state law do seem to be exactly the same on this point but i have i do not understand how these two provision fit together when e verify be use suppose an employer the first thing the employer do be receive the form from the employee from the i process he look at the form well they reasonably seem to be authentic so that employer now have the good faith defense that be provide under by the i process under both federal law and state law but under both federal law and state law the employee employer either must or may also use the e verification system the employer get back a notice of non authorization but what and that create supposedly a rebuttable presumption under both system that the employee be not authorize to work how do that fit together if you have a complete defense for have use the i process in good faith the whole e verification process seem to be irrelevant under both federal law and state law i do not understand how they fit together well it be on page to of the appendix petition be not it ,161.25000000000006,Roberts Court,"Dec 8, 2010","Chamber of Commerce of the United States, et al.","Michael B.

2010,Pepper v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Would it be consistent with Booker for Congress to pass a statute that says the following: When a judge initially imposes a sentence, the judge must specify all of the factors that the judge thinks are relevant to that sentence, whether it's going to be a sentence within the guidelines or a sentence that is outside of the guidelines, and if there is then a remand, the judge may impose a sentence based on the factors that were listed at the initial sentencing but not based on any of the other factors? Isn't that exactly what 3742(g)(2) does? It says under 3553(c), the sentencing judge is supposed to explain the factors that justify the sentence that is imposed. And that would -- that means explain a sentence outside of the guidelines, and also explain why the judge chooses a particular sentence within the guidelines range. We have -- 3742(g)(2) says that when there is a remand, the judge may take into account all the factors that were mentioned the first time, but not the other factors. Suppose that Mr. Pepper had an identical twin, and suppose that Mr. Pepper and his twin engaged in the same criminal conduct. They are charged with the same offenses; they are tried together; they are convicted of exactly the same offenses; they are sentenced on the same day. Between sentencing and the time of the appeal, they rehabilitate themselves in exactly the same way. The twin sentence is affirmed on appeal, and Pepper's sentence is overturned and he gets a remand for a new sentence. Why is it justified for Mr. Pepper to get credit for post-sentencing rehabilitation, but his twin does not? His twin did everything that was expected of him, too, but he doesn't get any credit for the rehabilitation. He just gets good time credit for good conduct while he's incarcerated. Well, isn't there a difference between evidence that -- evidence of conduct that occurred prior to the initial sentencing, but wasn't known at the time of the initial sentencing, and evidence of conduct that occurs between the initial sentencing and the resentencing? Maybe it's all or nothing. Maybe it works both ways, that the defendant doesn't get the credit for good conduct between sentencing and resentencing, but also doesn't get punished at resentencing for unproven conduct that occurs between the first sentence and the next -- and the second sentence. I'm-- --Yes. Well, under 3553(c), the court is supposed to explain the reasons for the sentence, even if it is within the guidelines; isn't that right? And so if the court is deciding whether the sentence should be 57 months or 63 months, whatever the figures were that you gave. The court thinks that some factor -- let's say age is significant -- the court should say, I am sentencing the defendant to 57 as opposed to 63 because of the defendant's advanced age or young age or whatever it is. Now on appeal, the -- the court of appeals says the guidelines sentence was improperly calculated, it should be -- the real range is 120 to 125 months, remand. Now if the court wants to grant a departure or a variance based on age, the court has mentioned age previously as a relevant factor, and it can do that. But if age was not -- if age was not relevant to the determination of where within the guidelines this sentence should be set, why is it -- why does the Constitution require that age be a relevant factor, a factor that's open to the judge on resentencing? It's just the notice provision. It's not -- it's not something that substantively limits what the court can do. ",would it be consistent with booker for congress to pass a statute that say the following when a judge initially impose a sentence the judge must specify all of the factor that the judge think be relevant to that sentence whether it be go to be a sentence within the guideline or a sentence that be outside of the guideline and if there be then a remand the judge may impose a sentence base on the factor that we be list at the initial sentencing but not base on any of the other factor be not that exactly what g do it say under c the sentence judge be suppose to explain the factor that justify the sentence that be impose and that would that mean explain a sentence outside of the guideline and also explain why the judge choose a particular sentence within the guideline range we have g say that when there be a remand the judge may take into account all the factor that we be mention the first time but not the other factor suppose that mr pepper have an identical twin and suppose that mr pepper and his twin engage in the same criminal conduct they be charge with the same offense they be try together they be convict of exactly the same offense they be sentence on the same day between sentence and the time of the appeal they rehabilitate themselves in exactly the same way the twin sentence be affirm on appeal and pepper s sentence be overturn and he get a remand for a new sentence why be it justify for mr pepper to get credit for post sentencing rehabilitation but his twin do not his twin do everything that be expect of him too but he do not get any credit for the rehabilitation he just get good time credit for good conduct while he be incarcerate well be not there a difference between evidence that evidence of conduct that occur prior to the initial sentencing but be not know at the time of the initial sentencing and evidence of conduct that occur between the initial sentencing and the resentencing maybe it be all or nothing maybe it work both way that the defendant do not get the credit for good conduct between sentence and resentencing but also do not get punish at resentencing for unproven conduct that occur between the first sentence and the next and the second sentence I be yes well under c the court be suppose to explain the reason for the sentence even if it be within the guideline be not that right and so if the court be decide whether the sentence should be month or month whatever the figure we be that you give the court think that some factor let us say age be significant the court should say i be sentence the defendant to as oppose to because of the defendant s advanced age or young age or whatever it be now on appeal the the court of appeal say the guideline sentence be improperly calculate it should be the real range be to month remand now if the court want to grant a departure or a variance base on age the court have mention age previously as a relevant factor and it can do that but if age be not if age be not relevant to the determination of where within the guideline this sentence should be set why be it why do the constitution require that age be a relevant factor a factor that be open to the judge on resentencing it be just the notice provision it be not it be not something that substantively limit what the court can do ,237.44000000000003,Roberts Court,"Dec 6, 2010",Jason Pepper,United States,09-6822,"Jun 28, 2010","Mar 2, 2011",112,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2010,Harrington v. Richter,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","If you looked back at a sample of the cases in which they have simply said ""denied"", would we find cases in which no procedural bar was raised by the State? But you didn't raise -- you haven't argued that it's procedurally barred. So you may have waived that. On the other hand, your opponent is, like -- I gather, until they got here, never argued that it was based on anything other than the merits. So they might have waived that. So everything might be waived here. Was there additional physical evidence found not at the scene? Could I ask you a question about California procedure? Is what happened here unusual? Is there -- doesn't -- does the prosecution have an obligation to provide notice before trial of its intention to call expert witnesses? And if the defendant requests that, what is the defendant's reciprocal obligation, if any? And what is your theory about why he -- why Johnson would have a motive to go through this exertion? He's -- he is wounded, and let's say there really was a gun -- a gun fight, and Klein fell someplace else. Johnson wants to make it seem like Klein was -- that there wasn't any gun fight. Why -- why is it so valuable to him to move Klein's body from the location where you think he fell to the couch? But he could have -- if he's going to make up a story, he could have made up a story that Klein jumped up and he was shot without having engaged in any firing himself and he fell wherever he fell. Putting him on the couch doesn't seem to -- unless I am missing something and you should explain it -- doesn't seem to aid this purportedly false story very much. And if you weigh whatever benefit there is from that against the exertion of moving this guy, it doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense. But maybe there's something there that's not apparent. Well, he had not received any notice from the State that they were going to call any experts, so why wasn't it reasonable for him to assume they are not going to call any experts? They are not going to be able to pull experts out of their pocket in the midst of the trial and the judge isn't going to allow them to do that without providing a -- without granting a recess. What seems to have happened here seems pretty unusual. But under your example then, isn't there a majority for the proposition that there is a procedural default, but disagreement as to the particular procedural default? Just a binary choice between procedural default and merits, isn't there -- and everybody agrees it should be denied and there is going to be a majority for one or the other, right? Is there more than one possible procedural problem here, I thought it was just timeliness?

2010,Davis v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, I understand your argument with respect to decisions of this Court, and I think that's your strongest argument, but would you concede that that argument does not apply when the precedent on which the police are relying is a decision of one of the courts of appeals or a State supreme court Fourth Amendment decision? In that situation, there will be plenty of avenues for obtaining review of the correctness of those decisions; isn't that right? Well, it applied its understanding of Belton, which turned out to be different from the understanding of the Arizona Supreme Court in Gant and the understanding of at least four members of this Court when Gant got here. If I could just come back to my question: Suppose you have a decision in one of the courts of appeals that says certain conduct is permitted under the Fourth Amendment, and the police in that circuit, Federal law enforcement officers in that circuit, follow that precedent. Now, is -- will there not be plenty of opportunities to review the correctness of that decision because the issue may arise in other circuits where the matter isn't settled? With respect to the incentives that you're talking about, is there really much difference between what would apply in a case like this and what already applies in cases that fall under Krull? Suppose Congress enacts a statute that authorizes a search under particular circumstances, as it did, as was the case in Almeida-Sanchez. Now, under Krull nobody is going to be able to, and no one who is subjected to a search under that statute is going to be able, to challenge, to obtain suppression, unless you can say that a reasonable law enforcement officer couldn't have thought that this statute which was enacted by Congress and signed by the President was a correct interpretation of the Fourth Amendment. Now, maybe there'll be a few cases like that, but in the great majority, the vast majority of cases, the person will not be able to mount such a challenge. So what is the difference between the situation here and the situation that the Court already approved in Krull? Well, we could leave that open here. We could say that there's no good faith immunity if a reasonable officer couldn't have believed that a prior decision of this Court was a correct interpretation of the Fourth Amendment. Maybe that sounds strange only because we have a higher opinion of ourselves than we do of the Congress and the President. Well, particularly in light of that, what is wrong with the suggestion that Justice Kagan raised in one of her questions about retaining an exception to the good faith exception for the situation, for the defendant whose case comes up here and results in the overruling of one of this Court's precedents? The Court invented the exclusionary rule. The Court invented the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule. Is there anything to prevent the Court from inventing a new exception to the exception to the exclusionary rule? Would the rule that you're arguing for apply only in the situation where there is a binding precedent that affirmatively approves a particular police practice, or would it also apply in the situation in which there is simply absolutely nothing on the books that prohibits the police practice, so that a reasonable officer wouldn't have any reason to think that the practice was unconstitutional? ",well i understand your argument with respect to decision of this court and i think that be your strong argument but would you concede that that argument do not apply when the precedent on which the police be rely be a decision of one of the court of appeal or a state supreme court fourth amendment decision in that situation there will be plenty of avenue for obtain review of the correctness of those decision be not that right well it apply its understanding of belton which turn out to be different from the understanding of the arizona supreme court in gant and the understanding of at least four member of this court when gant get here if i could just come back to my question suppose you have a decision in one of the court of appeal that say certain conduct be permit under the fourth amendment and the police in that circuit federal law enforcement officer in that circuit follow that precedent now be will there not be plenty of opportunity to review the correctness of that decision because the issue may arise in other circuit where the matter be not settle with respect to the incentive that you be talk about be there really much difference between what would apply in a case like this and what already apply in case that fall under krull suppose congress enact a statute that authorize a search under particular circumstance as it do as be the case in almeida sanchez now under krull nobody be go to be able to and no one who be subject to a search under that statute be go to be able to challenge to obtain suppression unless you can say that a reasonable law enforcement officer could not have think that this statute which be enact by congress and sign by the president be a correct interpretation of the fourth amendment now maybe there ll be a few case like that but in the great majority the vast majority of case the person will not be able to mount such a challenge so what be the difference between the situation here and the situation that the court already approve in krull well we could leave that open here we could say that there be no good faith immunity if a reasonable officer could not have believe that a prior decision of this court be a correct interpretation of the fourth amendment maybe that sound strange only because we have a high opinion of ourselves than we do of the congress and the president well particularly in light of that what be wrong with the suggestion that justice kagan raise in one of her question about retain an exception to the good faith exception for the situation for the defendant whose case come up here and result in the overruling of one of this court s precedent the court invent the exclusionary rule the court invent the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule be there anything to prevent the court from invent a new exception to the exception to the exclusionary rule would the rule that you be argue for apply only in the situation where there be a binding precedent that affirmatively approve a particular police practice or would it also apply in the situation in which there be simply absolutely nothing on the book that prohibit the police practice so that a reasonable officer would not have any reason to think that the practice be unconstitutional ,217.31000000000003,Roberts Court,"Mar 21, 2011",Willie Gene Davis,United States,09-11328,"Nov 1, 2010","Jun 16, 2011",112,0.0,1.0,0.0,0
2010,Wall v. Kholi,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","There is another argument that you could make other than the one you have been pressing, which is that collateral review means something other than a step in the criminal case. But you have chosen not to make that; is that correct. Am I correct that you think ""post-conviction or other collateral review"" means anything that occurs after the conclusion of direct review? Then what does the phrase ""or other collateral review"" add? Why -- why wouldn't Congress just say ""post-conviction review""? Can I return to the question Justice Ginsburg asked a couple minutes ago? Let's say we have a case in which a defendant convicted in State court has some exhausted Federal claims that this defendant wants to raise in a Federal habeas; also files a motion seeking a reduction of sentence based purely on a request for leniency, sentence within the range prescribed by the statute. What purpose is served by tolling the time to file the Federal habeas during the pendency of this request for leniency in the State court? You say comity, but in concrete practical terms what purpose is served? In your experience, does that happen a lot? You have somebody who is sentenced to a 5-year sentence and that's within the range, also has legal challenges that would result in no conviction, no time whatsoever and no criminal conviction, that person decides to give up on the legal challenge because the 5-year sentence might be reduced to 3 or 2 or 1? What would happen if the statutory maximum for an offense in Rhode Island is 5 years and the sentencing judge imposes a sentence of 10 years, and the defense attorney at that time says, Well, you can't do that; that's more than a statutory maximum, and the judge goes ahead with it and then an appeal is taken? Are you saying that the appellate court in Rhode Island would not entertain that argument? They would say you have to go back and make a Rule 35 motion in the trial court? I mean, that's the procedure. That seems odd. Is that it? Could I return you to something more basic? Do you think the term ""collateral review"" is a legal term of art, or is it a term that we can -- we should interpret simply by looking up the word ""collateral"" in a dictionary? Isn't -- if I look up ""collateral attack"" in Black's Law Dictionary, won't I find a definition there? Won't it tell me that this is something other than the proceeding? This is an attack on a judgment outside of the proceeding that led to the entry of that judgment. Isn't that what the term generally means? Right. It is part of the case. What about just a regular motion for a new trial, not based on newly -- on newly discovered evidence? Is that collateral, or is that part of the criminal proceeding? What's wrong with the argument that nothing that occurs in the criminal case itself is collateral? What Congress had in mind when it spoke about collateral review was something like habeas. Let me give you an alternative interpretation of this, and maybe it's completely wrong, but you will tell me why it's wrong. Post-conviction is a term of art. Many states, including Rhode Island, have post-conviction review statutes. So Congress wanted to have that time, the time when those proceedings were tolled -- were pending, were tolled -- but not every State uses that phrase. Not every State uses that term. They have other names for the proceeding, and that's what's meant by ""other collateral review"". Collateral review is a term of art. It's not something that you understand by looking up the word ""collateral"" in a dictionary. What's wrong with that? I'm not saying it has to do with whether it's legal or something else.

So if this cause arose in a different context with a different trustee, the position of the United States would be that under Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence there is a fiduciary exception to the attorney-client privilege? The thrust of what -- my understanding of the thrust of what Justice Sotomayor was asking is something like the following: It's easy to understand how there can be competing government interests when you're talking about some, the management of lands, things of that nature. But when you're just talking about managing funds, what competing interests can there be in practical terms? If you assume arguendo that this exception applies to a private trustee, why should it not apply to the government in practical terms? Well, what do you make of the fact that the Uniform Trust Code reserves decision on the question whether there is a fiduciary exception to the attorney-client privilege? That seems to suggest that as a general matter, this is not as well-established as you seem to argue. If we assume for the sake of argument that a private trustee may, using the private trustee's own fund, hire an attorney to obtain prospective advice about liability, does that doom your argument here for the reason that the government claims it has no ability to set up a system like this, to have some attorneys in the solicitor's office provide advice regarding the management of the funds and other attorneys in the solicitor's office provide advice regarding -- regarding the possibility of prospective liability in light of all of these suits that you mentioned?

2010,Nevada Commission on Ethics v. Carrigan,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, I found this statute very difficult to understand, but maybe you can explain what's -- what I found a bit puzzling. The statute talks about a commitment in a private capacity to the interests of others. Now, I take it that that commitment doesn't have to be something contractual. When you're talking about relatives, that would assume -- that that would include emotional commitments to the relatives who are listed; is that correct? Not -- not a financial interest of the public official, a financial interest of the -- the relative or the person who is substantially similar to a relative. Or is that wrong? Maybe if I give you an example it will be clearer. Let's take somebody who is within the third degree of consanguinity. So that would include second cousins? Okay. Now, let's say a public officer is considering something that would affect everybody's property taxes in town or a measure that would affect the benefits or the wages of everybody who works for the town. And this official has a second cousin whose property taxes would be affected or works for the town, and the second cousin's wages or benefits would be affected. Now, would that person have to recuse? Well, if I were a public officer I would find it very difficult to figure out whether a reasonable person would think that an effect on my second cousin's property taxes would require -- would materially affect my judgment. But it's even worse than that because of the ""substantially similar"". So the public officer not only has to think about second cousins; the person has to think about everybody who is like a second cousin to him or her. I have no idea how you -- how you go about that. This statute doesn't apply just to voting. It says that the public officer shall not vote upon or advocate the passage or failure of the message. Advocating the passage or failure of the message is surely speech in the ordinary understanding of the concept. In several recent cases the Court has taken pains to make the point that it is not going to recognize any new categories of unprotected speech. But the argument that you seem to be endorsing now in response to some questions is that there is this new category of unprotected speech, which is advocacy of the passage of legislation when a recusal statute comes into play. What about the rules of civility in the houses of Congress? There are things that a member of the Senate, for example, cannot say about another Senator, or make a personal attack. That would be protected by the First Amendment if the Senator stepped outside the door. Are those -- is there First Amendment protection for that? Do they have -- do those rules have to pass First Amendment scrutiny? If they based their decision solely on the -- on the fact that Vasquez had been the campaign manager in the past and he was a great campaign manager, and perhaps Carrigan would like him to be his campaign manager in the future, would there be a problem then? Well, suppose somebody had made extensive independent expenditures in support of the -- the public officer's prior campaign, and the public officer may hope that they -- similar expenditures will be made in the future. Would that be a basis? Why not? ",well i find this statute very difficult to understand but maybe you can explain what be what i find a bit puzzling the statute talk about a commitment in a private capacity to the interest of others now i take it that that commitment do not have to be something contractual when you be talk about relative that would assume that that would include emotional commitment to the relative who be list be that correct not not a financial interest of the public official a financial interest of the the relative or the person who be substantially similar to a relative or be that wrong maybe if i give you an example it will be clear let us take somebody who be within the third degree of consanguinity so that would include second cousin okay now let us say a public officer be consider something that would affect everybody s property tax in town or a measure that would affect the benefit or the wage of everybody who work for the town and this official have a second cousin whose property tax would be affect or work for the town and the second cousin s wage or benefit would be affect now would that person have to recuse well if i we be a public officer i would find it very difficult to figure out whether a reasonable person would think that an effect on my second cousin s property tax would require would materially affect my judgment but it be even bad than that because of the substantially similar so the public officer not only have to think about second cousin the person have to think about everybody who be like a second cousin to him or her i have no idea how you how you go about that this statute do not apply just to vote it say that the public officer shall not vote upon or advocate the passage or failure of the message advocate the passage or failure of the message be surely speech in the ordinary understanding of the concept in several recent case the court have take pain to make the point that it be not go to recognize any new category of unprotected speech but the argument that you seem to be endorse now in response to some question be that there be this new category of unprotected speech which be advocacy of the passage of legislation when a recusal statute come into play what about the rule of civility in the house of congress there be thing that a member of the senate for example can not say about another senator or make a personal attack that would be protect by the first amendment if the senator step outside the door be those be there first amendment protection for that do they have do those rule have to pass first amendment scrutiny if they base their decision solely on the on the fact that vasquez have be the campaign manager in the past and he be a great campaign manager and perhaps carrigan would like him to be his campaign manager in the future would there be a problem then well suppose somebody have make extensive independent expenditure in support of the the public officer s prior campaign and the public officer may hope that they similar expenditure will be make in the future would that be a basis why not ,200.25000000000009,Roberts Court,"Apr 27, 2011",Nevada Commission on Ethics,Michael A.

2010,Ortiz v. Jordan,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","This gets to what troubles me about this case. Although the Sixth Circuit referred to summary judgment in its opinion, it seems to me the Sixth Circuit actually reviewed the evidence at trial and determined that the defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law based on the evidence at trial. So I don't know why this case actually presents the question on which cert was granted. It seems to me it presents a question of -- a purely factual question in the end, whether there was -- whether judgment as a matter of law was appropriate. And you never raised the judgment as a matter of law. You never raised in the court of appeals, as I understand it, the argument that the defendants' ability to object to the entry of judgment as a matter of law was waived because they never filed the Rule 50(b) motion. Isn't that right? Well, suppose we were to hold that they couldn't review the denial of summary judgment. The case is remanded to them and they say: Okay, well, we made a slip of the pen when we referred to summary judgment in the prior decision. We really were saying that the defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law and, although there wasn't a Rule 50(b) motion, that was waived because it wasn't raised on appeal. So we are -- we come back to exactly where we are now. All we have done is to correct a slip of the -- what was arguably a slip of the pen, perhaps motivated by their belief that the Rule 50(b) issue is jurisdictional. But it really is not under our cases distinguishing between jurisdictional questions and claims processing questions. Mr. Mills, I got you started on this, but none of this is the question on which we granted review, is it? We didn't grant review to decide whether a court of appeals can consider judgment as a matter of law where there isn't a 50(b) motion and no argument is made that the -- that issue was waived by failing to make the motion. We didn't grant review on that. And your argument is that where the district court denies summary judgment on a qualified immunity issue that is based even purely on an issue of law, there can't be a review unless that's renewed -- there can't be appellate review unless that purely legal question is renewed in the Rule 50(b) motion. That's your argument? But what if the facts are utterly undisputed? There is a videotape of exactly what went on. Nobody has the slightest disagreement about the facts. The only question is whether the right was clearly established, and the district court rejects that at summary judgment. What benefit -- what is the point of saying that the defendants have to raise that same issue again in the Rule 50(b) motion? It's utterly a -- a pointless exercise. The -- determining what is a mixed question is notoriously difficult. What about the -- the situation where the -- the ruling is, assuming certain facts to be true, the -- the right was not clearly established? Now, is the fact that certain facts are assumed to be true enough to make that a mixed question? Mr. Mizer, is it your understanding that -- that Unitherm was based on Seventh Amendment considerations, or was it based on prior decisions that in turn were grounded on considerations of fairness to the verdict-winner, namely the opportunity when a motion for judgment as a matter of law is made after the verdict to move for dismissal without prejudice or move for a new trial? The answer is it's a pointless gotcha rule. Isn't that the answer? It's a pure issue of law, and the district court has already said, I ruled on this on summary judgment; don't bother me with this again, and we're going to say: Well, you still have to raise it in a 50(b) motion. That -- there's no point. We might as well say that the lawyer has to stand on his head when the motion is made or jump up and down three times. ",this get to what trouble me about this case although the sixth circuit refer to summary judgment in its opinion it seem to me the sixth circuit actually review the evidence at trial and determine that the defendant we be entitle to judgment as a matter of law base on the evidence at trial so i do not know why this case actually present the question on which cert be grant it seem to me it present a question of a purely factual question in the end whether there be whether judgment as a matter of law be appropriate and you never raise the judgment as a matter of law you never raise in the court of appeal as i understand it the argument that the defendant ability to object to the entry of judgment as a matter of law be waive because they never file the rule b motion be not that right well suppose we we be to hold that they could not review the denial of summary judgment the case be remand to them and they say okay well we make a slip of the pen when we refer to summary judgment in the prior decision we really we be say that the defendant we be entitle to judgment as a matter of law and although there be not a rule b motion that be waive because it be not raise on appeal so we be we come back to exactly where we be now all we have do be to correct a slip of the what be arguably a slip of the pen perhaps motivate by their belief that the rule b issue be jurisdictional but it really be not under our case distinguish between jurisdictional question and claim process question mr mill i get you start on this but none of this be the question on which we grant review be it we do not grant review to decide whether a court of appeal can consider judgment as a matter of law where there be not a b motion and no argument be make that the that issue be waive by fail to make the motion we do not grant review on that and your argument be that where the district court deny summary judgment on a qualified immunity issue that be base even purely on an issue of law there can not be a review unless that be renew there can not be appellate review unless that purely legal question be renew in the rule b motion that be your argument but what if the fact be utterly undisputed there be a videotape of exactly what go on nobody have the slight disagreement about the fact the only question be whether the right be clearly establish and the district court reject that at summary judgment what benefit what be the point of say that the defendant have to raise that same issue again in the rule b motion it be utterly a a pointless exercise the determine what be a mixed question be notoriously difficult what about the the situation where the the ruling be assume certain fact to be true the the right be not clearly establish now be the fact that certain fact be assume to be true enough to make that a mixed question mr mizer be it your understand that that unitherm be base on seventh amendment consideration or be it base on prior decision that in turn we be ground on consideration of fairness to the verdict winner namely the opportunity when a motion for judgment as a matter of law be make after the verdict to move for dismissal without prejudice or move for a new trial the answer be it be a pointless gotcha rule be not that the answer it be a pure issue of law and the district court have already say i rule on this on summary judgment do not bother me with this again and we be go to say well you still have to raise it in a b motion that there be no point we might as well say that the lawyer have to stand on his head when the motion be make or jump up and down three time ,257.36,Roberts Court,"Nov 1, 2010",Michelle Ortiz,Paula Jordan and Rebecca Bright,09-737,"Apr 26, 2010","Jan 24, 2011",112,1.0,1.0,1.0,1

2011,Coleman v. Maryland Court of Appeals,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, following up on Justice Kagan's question, I have -- I have difficulty seeing how providing 12 weeks of leave for self-care for both men and women affects the incentive of an employer who we will assume has an inclination to discriminate against women based on the possibility that a -- a woman applicant for employment may become pregnant. I -- I just don't see how that would affect the incentives of -- of an employer in that situation. Well, (A) is not at issue, right? Okay. So we're just dealing with (D), which concerns a serious health condition. So you have an employer who is willing to discriminate on the basis of gender, and the employer has two applicants for employment, a man and a woman. And the employer says, well, if I hire the man, he might take 12 weeks of leave for a serious medical condition. And if I hire the woman, she might take 12 weeks of leave for a serious medical condition which might be something that either men or women could get, or it also could be a sickness related to pregnancy. So, there still is -- there still would be an incentive for this hypothetical employer to discriminate against the woman. But how does it do that? That's what I'm -- I understand that and it's a worthy objective. I just don't understand how giving both men and women 12 weeks for self-care affects the incentive. Well, with respect to the Commerce Clause, could I ask you this. If we were to disagree with you on the Fourteenth Amendment and hold that it -- that Congress didn't validly abrogate State sovereign immunity with respect to subsection (D), would your client still be able to seek reinstatement or other injunctive relief? Here the district court completely dismissed your FMLA claim, not just insofar as you sought damages. I -- I think you also sought reinstatement and other equitable relief, but the district court dismissed it completely. But you are not contesting that, are you? You said in this case. That's basically what I'm asking. If we were to disagree with you on the Fourteenth Amendment, are you asking us -- would we then simply affirm the Fourth Circuit? Or would we have to -- would we have to make some accommodation for the possibility that the dismissal of your claim insofar as you sought injunctive relief may have been improper? I am trying to be a little bit helpful to you. Okay. I thought you did, but maybe I'm reading your complaint more generously than you read it yourself. Assume for the sake of argument that for the applicants for particular provisions -- particular positions, I should say -- where the applicants are typically of a certain age, men tend to take less sick leave than women, because women also take sick leave for pregnancy-related illnesses. So giving everybody 12 weeks eliminates the possibility that women who will be taking -- want to take additional -- want to take more sick leave will be fired because they exceed the amount of sick leave allowed by the employer for everybody. Now, isn't that connected to eliminating discrimination in employment? Well, I don't think -- I have difficulty with the incentives argument either, honestly, either as the (D) or as to (C). But I'm just talking about an argument based on consequences. If an employer says you get 2 weeks of sick leave, period, after that if you can't come back you are fired, that may, at least for applicants within a certain age range, that may have a much more severe or a more severe impact on women than on men. What would the answer to that be, that that's not intentional discrimination? Well, what if Congress had added three additional subsections here, and said that an employer has to provide 12 weeks of unpaid leave so that an employee can go to a health spa; 12 weeks of unpaid leave so that the employee can travel; 12 weeks of unpaid leave so that the employee can take an educational course. Now, those could be taken advantage of by either men and women. It makes both men and women increasingly unattractive as employees and therefore reduces any special disincentive that might have been created by (A), (B), and (C). Now on that same logic, would those be -- would those be provisions that further the elimination of discrimination based on gender? Well, if the State of Maryland thinks this is good social policy, why is it asserting its sovereign immunity? You can waive. Can't you waive your Eleventh Amendment immunity? ",well follow up on justice kagan s question i have i have difficulty see how provide week of leave for self care for both men and woman affect the incentive of an employer who we will assume have an inclination to discriminate against woman base on the possibility that a a woman applicant for employment may become pregnant i i just do not see how that would affect the incentive of of an employer in that situation well a be not at issue right okay so we be just deal with d which concern a serious health condition so you have an employer who be willing to discriminate on the basis of gender and the employer have two applicant for employment a man and a woman and the employer say well if i hire the man he might take week of leave for a serious medical condition and if i hire the woman she might take week of leave for a serious medical condition which might be something that either men or woman could get or it also could be a sickness relate to pregnancy so there still be there still would be an incentive for this hypothetical employer to discriminate against the woman but how do it do that that be what I be i understand that and it be a worthy objective i just do not understand how give both men and woman week for self care affect the incentive well with respect to the commerce clause could i ask you this if we we be to disagree with you on the fourteenth amendment and hold that it that congress do not validly abrogate state sovereign immunity with respect to subsection d would your client still be able to seek reinstatement or other injunctive relief here the district court completely dismiss your fmla claim not just insofar as you seek damage i i think you also seek reinstatement and other equitable relief but the district court dismiss it completely but you be not contest that be you you say in this case that be basically what I be ask if we we be to disagree with you on the fourteenth amendment be you ask us would we then simply affirm the fourth circuit or would we have to would we have to make some accommodation for the possibility that the dismissal of your claim insofar as you seek injunctive relief may have be improper i be try to be a little bit helpful to you okay i think you do but maybe I be read your complaint more generously than you read it yourself assume for the sake of argument that for the applicant for particular provision particular position i should say where the applicant be typically of a certain age men tend to take less sick leave than woman because woman also take sick leave for pregnancy relate illness so give everybody week eliminate the possibility that woman who will be take want to take additional want to take more sick leave will be fire because they exceed the amount of sick leave allow by the employer for everybody now be not that connect to eliminate discrimination in employment well i do not think i have difficulty with the incentive argument either honestly either as the d or as to c but I be just talk about an argument base on consequence if an employer say you get week of sick leave period after that if you can not come back you be fire that may at least for applicant within a certain age range that may have a much more severe or a more severe impact on woman than on men what would the answer to that be that that be not intentional discrimination well what if congress have add three additional subsection here and say that an employer have to provide week of unpaid leave so that an employee can go to a health spa week of unpaid leave so that the employee can travel week of unpaid leave so that the employee can take an educational course now those could be take advantage of by either men and woman it make both men and woman increasingly unattractive as employee and therefore reduces any special disincentive that might have be create by a b and c now on that same logic would those be would those be provision that further the elimination of discrimination base on gender well if the state of maryland think this be good social policy why be it assert its sovereign immunity you can waive can not you waive your eleventh amendment immunity ,317.63,Roberts Court,"Jan 11, 2012",Daniel Coleman,Court of Appeals of Maryland,10-1016,"Jun 27, 2011","Mar 20, 2012",112,0.0,1.0,0.0,0

2011,Perry v. Perez,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Can I ask you a question about timing? Let's suppose that the district court in Washington moves expeditiously and issues a decision in mid-February. Are there insuperable problems with postponing the Texas primary so that the plan that is to be used can -- doesn't have to be formulated until after the district court in Washington has ruled? Texas has a very early primary. Some States have them for congressional races in -- in the fall, and the latest presidential primary I think is at the end of June. So why can't this all be pushed back, and wouldn't that eliminate a lot of the problems that we are grappling with in this case? Well, if we have a binary choice, if it's either the plan enacted by the Texas legislature or the plan that's already been drawn up by the court, yes, that could be presumably resolved rather quickly. But what if neither of those is fully acceptable. Then is it -- is it practicable to have the primary on the date that's been agreed on? And if not, then would you just prefer to limit us to those two possibilities or would Texas entertain the possibility of moving the primary back? What are neutral districting principles? Anybody who draws a map faces at the outset certain legal constraints, constitutional constraints, restrictions that are imposed by the Voting Rights Act, maybe some State law restrictions to the extent they are not inconsistent with Federal law. Once you have gotten beyond that point, all you have left is districting policy. They are policy choices and there are many factors that can be taken into account in drawing a map: How compact you want the districts to be, to what extent are you going to respect zones of economic interest, to what extent are you going to try to preserve old districts, what about incumbents, what about party registration? Are you going to try to have balance or are you going to try to favor one party or the other? That's all -- those are all questions of policy. And the question is who makes those policy decisions? Are they going to be the policy decisions that were made by the legislature, or are they going to be the policy decisions made by the district court? And to say they are going to apply neutral districting principles is a subterfuge. There is no such thing. I don't want to interrupt you too much, but even if you do that, even if you start with the old plan and then you modify it to the extent necessary to comply with Constitution and statutes, there are still -- I'm sure our computer could shoot out dozens and dozens of possible maps, and somebody has to choose among them. Now what criteria does a district judge, does a district court use in making that choice? Let's say a legislature says -- says we have a new policy, and that is that once we've satisfied our constitutional obligations and our obligations under the Voting Rights Act, the only thing we are going to do is try to draw the districts that are the most compact possible, compactness over everything else. They draw up a plan that embodies that policy, and it's challenged under section 5. Now can the district court just say well, that's -- the State's policy is compactness over everything else, but we don't agree with that, because we have other neutral principles that advance the interest of the collective public good, which is the -- the term that this -- the -- the words that this Court used. Can they do that? Well, if they can't do that then you are saying that they are constrained by State policy, except to the extent the Constitution or the Voting Rights Act requires otherwise. Well, if Texas says we don't care about maintaining voting precincts; this is -- this is a matter of -- of administrative burden and expense, and we are willing to bear that, so disregard that. The district court can say well, we think, we disagree with you; in order to make it more convenient to hold the election and less expensive for Texas, we are going to respect voting districts. They can do that? But could they do that? Could the district court do that? That's my question. That's for presidential primaries, isn't it? I don't want to interrupt, but isn't that the date of the last presidential primary rather than congressional?

2011,Missouri v. Frye,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","I am really puzzled by what as a practical matter is at stake in this case. Under the State court decision, the defendant has the option of either pleading guilty to the charge -- in which case he will be right back where he is now -- or he can insist on a trial. If he insists on the trial, you need to prove that he was driving with a revoked license. That seems to me -- if there ever was a slam dunk trial, that seems to me that's the slam dunk trial. You introduce the records of -- showing that his license was revoked, and you have the officer testify that on such and such a date, he was driving. So I -- I don't really see what is involved in this case. I don't see what is at stake here. I don't see what that -- as a practical matter, this seems to be -- to me a case about nothing. Am I wrong? Am I missing something? Suppose he had snapped up this deal as soon as it was offered. By the time he -- he appeared before the court to answer a formal plea of guilty, would the court have known that he had in the interim been arrested yet again for driving without a license? Suppose he had been told that -- suppose he had been told that, and the prosecutor said, well, yes, that's true. I made that offer, but it's off the table now. And apparently, this was then off the table. So what good would it have done him to know about something that happened in the past but was no longer available. I understand that. It may have been unfair, but I don't see why it's involuntary. Because I don't see that -- advising him that he had an option at some point in the past which was no longer available really doesn't have much of a -- doesn't have any bearing on the voluntariness of his plea to a later less-favorable offer. Where the case goes to trial prejudice isn't going to be very hard to prove. The person turned down the 5-year deal and gets -- and after trial is sentenced to 20 years. So you've got -- you're got prejudice right there, right? So there's always going to be a very good argument for prejudice where a person turns down a favorable deal and then gets slammed after a trial. The point is just -- I'm sorry. The point is just that prejudice isn't going to be very tough to show, is it? You turned down a 1-year deal and later when that was off the table, you accepted a 5-year deal. That's prejudice. On the issue of-- --On the issue of remedy, as the Respondent are you not limited to the remedies that were provided in the judgment of the State court? You didn't file a cross petition and there wasn't one granted. So aren't -- aren't you limited to defending the judgment below? Can you ask for a modification of the judgment below in your favor? You think that because we added a question that acts as the functional equivalent of a granted cross petition, that would permit modification of the judgment in your favor?

As I understand your argument, you satisfy the -- the ground for seeking deletion or correction was satisfied even before Novo wrote the new use code that you claim is overly broad.

2011,Armour v. City of Indianapolis,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Could the city cure the problem by rescinding the forgiveness for those who paid under the installment plan? Why not? I think you've put your finger on the reason for this, which is that the city calculated that what it did would be more politically acceptable than treating the people who paid upfront equally on an economic basis with the people who paid in installment plans. Now if that's the reason for this, is that rational? But what does that mean, they wanted to get out of the Barrett Law business? That really doesn't seem very complicated to collect payments that people have agreed to pay. And if they didn't want to do it anymore, I bet they could have contracted that out for a very modest fee to any number of private entities that would have done it for them. Other than political expediency and administrative convenience, I still don't understand what rational basis you claim there was for the distinction that was drawn. Now maybe one of those is sufficient, but other than those two possible bases, I don't see another one. There is lots of reasons for not giving refunds, but what are the reasons for forgiving the debt that people agreed to? Well, they want forgiveness, but you outline correctly in your brief the fact that the city had three options. One of the options was to hold everybody to what they understood when they signed up under the Barrett Law. And I -- I do not understand how your administrative convenience argument fits in with the decision to forgive the debt of the people who agreed to pay on the installment plan. When the city was collecting those payments was that a net loss, were the administrative costs of making those collections more than the amount of money that was brought in? If not, then I don't see how administrative convenience justifies a rejection of that option. It's rational for a city to say that it costs us $100,000 to collect this money, and if we do collect it, we are going to bring in $500,000, so we don't want to pay the $100,000, so we are going to get rid of the program? That's rational? If the net -- if the net cost -- if it's a net gain, what is the rationality of abandoning it? You put your finger on it. They want to get out of the business. What they have done is shift the cost of the sewers from a -- from a small group, a small interest group that is able to presumably exert some political power to -- to everybody. They spread the cost around to everybody. And everybody -- the ordinary person who has to pay a little bit more every month doesn't get all fired up about it. That's what this -- that's what this is about, isn't it? Is there some identified or identifiable demographic difference between the two groups that either justifies or could on -- on a remand justify the different treatment? Well, time is usually a rational reason for doing it. If -- suppose everybody paid on the installment plan. The city could say as of a certain date we're -- no more installment payments. Then the people who paid up previously, would -- would they be -- would they have an equal protection claim? Suppose that there had never been the option of making the lump sum payment. Everybody paid on installment plans over a 10-year period, and then the city decided January 1, 2012, no more installment plans; everything that is still due is forgiven. That would be rational, wouldn't it? ",could the city cure the problem by rescind the forgiveness for those who pay under the installment plan why not i think you have put your finger on the reason for this which be that the city calculate that what it do would be more politically acceptable than treat the people who pay upfront equally on an economic basis with the people who pay in installment plan now if that be the reason for this be that rational but what do that mean they want to get out of the barrett law business that really do not seem very complicate to collect payment that people have agree to pay and if they do not want to do it anymore i bet they could have contract that out for a very modest fee to any number of private entity that would have do it for them other than political expediency and administrative convenience i still do not understand what rational basis you claim there be for the distinction that be draw now maybe one of those be sufficient but other than those two possible base i do not see another one there be lot of reason for not give refund but what be the reason for forgive the debt that people agree to well they want forgiveness but you outline correctly in your brief the fact that the city have three option one of the option be to hold everybody to what they understand when they sign up under the barrett law and i i do not understand how your administrative convenience argument fit in with the decision to forgive the debt of the people who agree to pay on the installment plan when the city be collect those payment be that a net loss we be the administrative cost of make those collection more than the amount of money that be bring in if not then i do not see how administrative convenience justifies a rejection of that option it be rational for a city to say that it cost us to collect this money and if we do collect it we be go to bring in so we do not want to pay the so we be go to get rid of the program that be rational if the net if the net cost if it be a net gain what be the rationality of abandon it you put your finger on it they want to get out of the business what they have do be shift the cost of the sewer from a from a small group a small interest group that be able to presumably exert some political power to to everybody they spread the cost around to everybody and everybody the ordinary person who have to pay a little bit more every month do not get all fire up about it that be what this that be what this be about be not it be there some identify or identifiable demographic difference between the two group that either justifies or could on on a remand justify the different treatment well time be usually a rational reason for do it if suppose everybody pay on the installment plan the city could say as of a certain date we be no more installment payment then the people who pay up previously would would they be would they have an equal protection claim suppose that there have never be the option of make the lump sum payment everybody pay on installment plan over a year period and then the city decide january no more installment plan everything that be still due be forgive that would be rational would not it ,189.51,Roberts Court,"Feb 29, 2012",Christine Armour,City of Indianapolis,11-161,"Nov 14, 2011","Jun 4, 2012",112,0.0,0.0,1.0,1

They provide testimony, and they may want an indictment to be returned, but it's the prosecutor who asks for the indictment to be returned. So I don't see how there is a complaining witness in that sense in the traditional grand jury context. Well, let me give you another example that I think happens with some frequency. You have a Federal grand jury and you have testimony by an FBI or a DEA case agent, a person who's been working on the case, and that witness provides a lot of information supporting the charges that the prosecutor wants returned. You also have a cooperating witness, someone who has entered into a plea bargain and in exchange for that is providing a lot of incriminating testimony. Now, is there a complaining witness in that situation? Which one is it? Both? The holding -- the holding that you are asking for isn't going to do very much good if the -- if the mere issuance of the grand jury subpoena renders the person not a complaining witness. In that situation, then why not subpoena everybody? You said that the issuance of a subpoena in itself is not sufficient to make somebody not a complaining witness. So if you are issued a subpoena you still might be a complaining witness if you really didn't need to get a subpoena. If you could have been persuaded to go without a subpoena, then maybe you could be a complaining witness. If somebody-- --At common law did any grand jury witnesses have absolute immunity from a claim for malicious prosecution? Well, could-- --And could there be malicious prosecution liability for a witness before a grand jury who was not a ""complaining witness"". So you are not really asking us to adopt the common law rule, are you? You are asking for a variation of the common law rule that is limited to complaining witnesses. Or are you going further. Are you saying that no witness before a grand jury should have absolute immunity from a so-called 1983 malicious prosecution claim? So if I understand your answer, that you're not -- that this whole business about complaining witness is irrelevant. Any -- no witness before a grand jury gets absolute immunity. Any witness could -- who would satisfy the elements of the malicious prosecution tort could be liable? All right. That's a little different, isn't it? I have the same -- I have the same concern as Justice Breyer. Let me try to ask the question in a different way. Can you give me an example of a case in which someone would qualify as a complaining witness under Mr. Pincus's definition and yet would not have done something outside of the grand jury that would be sufficient to make out a claim of malicious prosecution? If that situation doesn't exist, then I don't see any difference between your position and Mr. Pincus's position. Paragraph 29 of the complaint alleges Mr. Paulk and Mr. Hodges, acting under color of law, in retaliation and wrongfully influenced and instigated the prosecutorial decision to bring charges against Mr. Rehberg. Why isn't that sufficient to support a claim of so-called malicious prosecution without regard to the evidentiary -- or without regard to the grand jury testimony? Are those -- are those cases involving grand jury proceedings like the one here which does look somewhat like the complaint situation? Or are they more traditional grand jury settings? ",the problem i have with your argument be that i do not really know what a complaining witness be in the grand jury context let us take the federal grand jury as an example do you think there be complain witness before federal grand jury a complaining witness i would think be a person who file a complaint who cause in the federal system it would be someone who file a complaint and attest to it under rule that person be ask that charge be bring that be what it mean to be a complaining witness file a complaint nobody no witness before a federal grand jury ask that an indictment be return they provide testimony and they may want an indictment to be return but it be the prosecutor who ask for the indictment to be return so i do not see how there be a complain witness in that sense in the traditional grand jury context well let me give you another example that i think happens with some frequency you have a federal grand jury and you have testimony by an fbi or a dea case agent a person who be be work on the case and that witness provide a lot of information support the charge that the prosecutor want return you also have a cooperating witness someone who have enter into a plea bargain and in exchange for that be provide a lot of incriminate testimony now be there a complaining witness in that situation which one be it both the hold the hold that you be ask for be not go to do very much good if the if the mere issuance of the grand jury subpoena render the person not a complaining witness in that situation then why not subpoena everybody you say that the issuance of a subpoena in itself be not sufficient to make somebody not a complaining witness so if you be issue a subpoena you still might be a complaining witness if you really do not need to get a subpoena if you could have be persuade to go without a subpoena then maybe you could be a complaining witness if somebody at common law do any grand jury witness have absolute immunity from a claim for malicious prosecution well could and could there be malicious prosecution liability for a witness before a grand jury who be not a complaining witness so you be not really ask us to adopt the common law rule be you you be ask for a variation of the common law rule that be limit to complain witness or be you go far be you say that no witness before a grand jury should have absolute immunity from a so called malicious prosecution claim so if i understand your answer that you be not that this whole business about complain witness be irrelevant any no witness before a grand jury get absolute immunity any witness could who would satisfy the element of the malicious prosecution tort could be liable all right that be a little different be not it i have the same i have the same concern as justice breyer let me try to ask the question in a different way can you give me an example of a case in which someone would qualify as a complain witness under mr pincus s definition and yet would not have do something outside of the grand jury that would be sufficient to make out a claim of malicious prosecution if that situation do not exist then i do not see any difference between your position and mr pincus s position paragraph of the complaint allege mr paulk and mr hodges act under color of law in retaliation and wrongfully influenced and instigate the prosecutorial decision to bring charge against mr rehberg why be not that sufficient to support a claim of so call malicious prosecution without regard to the evidentiary or without regard to the grand jury testimony be those be those case involve grand jury proceeding like the one here which do look somewhat like the complaint situation or be they more traditional grand jury setting ,239.18,Roberts Court,"Nov 1, 2011",Charles A.

2011,United States v. Jones,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, that seems to get -- to me to get to what's really involved here, the issue of whether there is a technical trespass or not is potentially a ground for deciding this particular case, but it seems to me the heart of the problem that's presented by this case and will be presented by other cases involving new technology is that in the pre-computer, pre-Internet age much of the privacy -- I would say most of the privacy -- that people enjoyed was not the result of legal protections or constitutional protections; it was the result simply of the difficulty of traveling around and gathering up information. But with computers, it's now so simple to amass an enormous amount of information about people that consists of things that could have been observed on the streets, information that was made available to the public. If -- if this case is decided on the ground that there was a technical trespass, I don't have much doubt that in the near future it will be probable -- I think it's possible now in many instances -- for law enforcement to monitor people's movements on -- on public streets without committing a technical trespass. So how do we deal with this? Do we just say, well, nothing is changed, so that all the information that people expose to the public -- is, is fair game? There is no -- there is no search or seizure when that is -- when that is obtained, because there isn't a reasonable expectation of privacy? But isn't there a real change in -- in this regard? What is the size of this device? What is the size of this device? What if it was put on the license place. Would that be a technical trespass? Is that the property of the driver? Well, where would you draw the line? Suppose that the GPS was used only to track somebody's movements for one day or for 12 hours or for 3 hours. Would that be all right? Put aside -- put aside the trespass question. Well, that sounds like a legislative line. But what is the difference between following somebody for 12 hours, let's say, and monitoring their movements on a GPS for 12 hours? You would say that the latter -- your first argument is, there is a problem with the latter but not with the former. But what would the reason for that be? What -- what is the difference in terms of one's privacy whether you're followed by a police officer for 12 hours and you don't see the officer or whether you're monitored by GPS for 12 hours? You know, I don't know what society expects and I think it's changing. Technology is changing people's expectations of privacy. Suppose we look forward 10 years, and maybe 10 years from now 90 percent of the population will be using social networking sites and they will have on average 500 friends and they will have allowed their friends to monitor their location 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, through the use of their cell phones. Then -- what would the expectation of privacy be then? Well, that -- maybe that's a good way to decide the case. But I just wonder, would Mr. Jones or anybody else be really upset if they found that the police had sneaked up to their car and put an inert device the size of their credit card on the underside of the car? What would they say about that, other than the fact that the police are wasting money doing this? You don't even see it. It's just a little wafer, they put it under the car, it does nothing. But this one does nothing, and you -- so you would go -- you would sue -- you would bring a trespass action. So what's you're concerned about is not this little thing that's put on your car. It's not this invasion of your property interest. It's the monitoring that takes place. There was a warrant -- there was a warrant in this case. This is a puzzling aspect of the case to me and maybe there -- it's irrelevant for present purposes. There was a warrant and the two violations of are violations of a statute and a rule, neither of which may carry an exclusionary rule sanction with them or exclusionary rule penalty with them. It's not clear at all that there as a violation of the Fourth Amendment. So it's a little strange that we are deciding whether a warrantless search here would have been unconstitutional, when there was a warrant. No, that's not my point. The point is that the violation of the 10-day rule and the violation of the statutory prohibition on -- or maybe it's in the rule, the prohibition on the judge in the district, ordering the installation only in the district are not Fourth Amendment requirements. Not a warrantless intrusion, there was a warrant. I think if you look at the lower court case law, you will find that a violation of the 10-day rule is not necessarily a violation of the Fourth Amendment. And-- --doesn't vitiate the warrant. The warrant doesn't necessarily dissolve or evaporate when those 10 days expire. Maybe those cases are wrong. ",well that seem to get to me to get to what be really involve here the issue of whether there be a technical trespass or not be potentially a ground for decide this particular case but it seem to me the heart of the problem that be present by this case and will be present by other case involve new technology be that in the pre computer pre internet age much of the privacy i would say most of the privacy that people enjoy be not the result of legal protection or constitutional protection it be the result simply of the difficulty of travel around and gather up information but with computer it be now so simple to amass an enormous amount of information about people that consist of thing that could have be observe on the street information that be make available to the public if if this case be decide on the ground that there be a technical trespass i do not have much doubt that in the near future it will be probable i think it be possible now in many instance for law enforcement to monitor people s movement on on public street without commit a technical trespass so how do we deal with this do we just say well nothing be change so that all the information that people expose to the public be be fair game there be no there be no search or seizure when that be when that be obtain because there be not a reasonable expectation of privacy but be not there a real change in in this regard what be the size of this device what be the size of this device what if it be put on the license place would that be a technical trespass be that the property of the driver well where would you draw the line suppose that the gps be use only to track somebody s movement for one day or for hour or for hour would that be all right put aside put aside the trespass question well that sound like a legislative line but what be the difference between follow somebody for hour let us say and monitor their movement on a gps for hour you would say that the latter your first argument be there be a problem with the latter but not with the former but what would the reason for that be what what be the difference in term of one s privacy whether you be follow by a police officer for hour and you do not see the officer or whether you be monitor by gps for hour you know i do not know what society expect and i think it be change technology be change people s expectation of privacy suppose we look forward year and maybe year from now percent of the population will be use social networking site and they will have on average friend and they will have allow their friend to monitor their location hour a day day a year through the use of their cell phone then what would the expectation of privacy be then well that maybe that be a good way to decide the case but i just wonder would mr jones or anybody else be really upset if they find that the police have sneak up to their car and put an inert device the size of their credit card on the underside of the car what would they say about that other than the fact that the police be waste money do this you do not even see it it be just a little wafer they put it under the car it do nothing but this one do nothing and you so you would go you would sue you would bring a trespass action so what be you be concern about be not this little thing that be put on your car it be not this invasion of your property interest it be the monitoring that take place there be a warrant there be a warrant in this case this be a puzzle aspect of the case to me and maybe there it be irrelevant for present purpose there be a warrant and the two violation of be violation of a statute and a rule neither of which may carry an exclusionary rule sanction with them or exclusionary rule penalty with them it be not clear at all that there as a violation of the fourth amendment so it be a little strange that we be decide whether a warrantless search here would have be unconstitutional when there be a warrant no that be not my point the point be that the violation of the day rule and the violation of the statutory prohibition on or maybe it be in the rule the prohibition on the judge in the district order the installation only in the district be not fourth amendment requirement not a warrantless intrusion there be a warrant i think if you look at the low court case law you will find that a violation of the day rule be not necessarily a violation of the fourth amendment and do not vitiate the warrant the warrant do not necessarily dissolve or evaporate when those day expire maybe those case be wrong ,271.7099999999999,Roberts Court,"Nov 8, 2011",United States,Antoine Jones,10-1259,"Jun 27, 2011","Jan 23, 2012",112,0.0,1.0,1.0,0
2011,Martel v. Clair,112,"Samuel A.

Could you tell us what has happened with that? I'm sorry. Could you tell us what has us what has happened with that litigation? That's what I was referring to. And what -- what has happened there? Was there -- was there testing of this evidence in connection with that? What about a -- a possible Brady claim? Is there a disagreement about whether this physical evidence could have been tested at the -- and revealed anything at the time of the trial? What about an actual innocence claim? That would be pretty incredible. Maybe that's what's required. Why isn't this is a fair reading of what Judge Taylor did? As of April 29th, as I recall, there was not a problem with the representation. And the decision was made on June 30th. Now, on June 16th, that's the time when Clair sent his letter. By this point, the petition had been pending for a long time before the judge. The judge presumably was approaching the point where he was going to issue his decision. He saw the letter. He could not see any way in which the matters that were discussed in the letters could lead to a claim that would go anywhere. As to the physical evidence, if it couldn't have been tested at the time of trial, there would not have been a Brady obligation, and an actual innocence claim here would be quite far-fetched in light of the very incriminating statements that -- that Mr. Clair made in the tape recorded conversation. Had he substituted counsel, he would not have been under an obligation, I think, to allow substituted counsel to amend the petition, which had been pending for a long period of time. So he said: Counsel is doing a proper job; there doesn't appear to be a conflict of interest; and I'm going to deny this. Now, counsel could have been appointed and in fact was appointed to represent Mr. Clair going forward. Why isn't that a fair reading of what he did? And if so, what need was there for further inquiry? But the interests of justice is such an open-ended test. If that is the test, doesn't it follow that it will only be in the rarest of cases that a district judge will have been found -- will be found to have abused his or her discretion in denying a substitution request? Why does that very broad standard help you here? I know you think there should be inquiry. Before your time runs out, how would the finger -- how would the fact that there were fingerprints at the scene that do not match anybody who was known to be in that house have provided evidence for -- provided the basis for any claim that could have established Mr. Clair's innocence at this late -- at this late date, in the face of the other evidence that was present in this case: the recorded statements? Well, suppose defense counsel had introduced at trial fingerprint evidence showing that 10 people were present at some point in that house and they weren't people who lived there. That's -- it's weak exculpatory evidence for the defendant at best that there were unknown people in the house. It might have been the cable guy. Who knows who they were?

2011,Williams v. Illinois,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Hasn't it long been accepted that experts may testify to the facts that form the basis for their opinions on the ground that when the experts go over those facts they are not -- that information is not being introduced to prove the truth of the matter asserted, the truth of those underlying fact; only that those are the facts that the expert has relied on in reaching an opinion? And that has not been considered to be hearsay. Now, do you argue that those -- that that is incorrect, those -- those statements cannot be testified to by an expert without their -- their constituting either hearsay or testimony within the meaning of the Confrontation Clause? Well, let's say that-- --Let me put it this way. Let's say the expert -- people from the -- the expert testifies: I received the -- I looked at the report from -- from the lab; I looked at the report from -- from -- I looked at the report from Cellmark, the outside lab; I looked at the report that we did; and there -- there is a match. And so the expert is -- is mentioning facts that form the basis of the opinion but not testifying to the truth of those. Is that a violation of the Confrontation Clause at that point? Well, ten is not -- ten is not a far-fetched hypothetical. We have an amicus brief from the Manhattan District Attorney's office and the New York City Chief Medical Examiner's office, and they say that their very fine crime lab involves at least 12 technicians in the analysis of DNA. They break it down that way because it increases accuracy, it decreases the chance of any favoritism for the prosecution, and they say that: is impossible for us to bring all 12 of those technicians into court to testify in every case in which there is DNA evidence; and if we have to do that we will just not be able to use DNA evidence in court; we will have to rely on less reliable evidence. Is that just a -- Do you think that's just a practical consequence that we have to accept under Crawford? How will bringing in one satisfy the Confrontation Clause problem? If 12 people perform steps in the analysis and one person testifies about what 11 other people did, don't you have the same Confrontation Clause problem? You don't? Why is that not a testimonial statement? If the person were in court, the person would say: This is what I did. And that's not testimony? Well, what did the Illinois appellate court say about that, about whether the information, whether the evidence was admitted for the truth of the matter asserted? But isn't Justice Kagan's question there the correct question? Isn't that a question of Illinois evidence law, not a Federal constitutional question? Was there sufficient foundation laid for the introduction of the expert's testimony? That was addressed by the Illinois court? Well, there are two types of evidence that are -- that are involved here. One is chain of custody evidence. Was the result that -- that was sent back the result that was done on the sample that was sent to Cellmark? That's just purely chain of custody. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the -- the accuracy or the professionalism of what was done at Cellmark. And she did make a statement. She did say that the sample -- that the result that came back from Cellmark was -- was done -- was based on a test of the vaginal swab that was sent there. The other has to do with what Cellmark did, how well they did it. She didn't say anything about that. Now, as to the chain of custody, if that's testimonial, isn't -- isn't it simply duplicative of the very strong circumstantial evidence regarding the chain of custody -- the sending of it out with certain markings, and the receipt back with certain markings?

Do you really think that there is -- that the First Amendment -- that there is First Amendment value in a bald-faced lie about a purely factual statement that a person makes about himself, because that person would like to create a particular persona? Gee, I won the Medal of Honor. I was a Rhodes scholar, I won the Nobel Prize. There's a personal -- the First Amendment protects that? You acknowledge that the First Amendment allows the prohibition or the regulation of false speech if it causes at least certain kinds of harms. And the problem I have with your argument is determining which harms you think count and which harms don't count. Would you go as far as was suggested earlier to say that only pecuniary harm counts? If you -- if you say that, then the -- the classic case of intentional infliction of emotional distress is unconstitutional, going up to someone and saying falsely, your -- your child has just been run over by a bus. So how do we determine which harms are sufficient? When you say imminent, you mean -- what do you mean by that? Well, if that's the standard then most of the prosecutions for making false statements to a Federal law enforcement officer are not going to survive, are they? Well, then you're not really talking about imminent harm, I don't think. You're just talking about harm. It seems to me what you're arguing is that we should determine that there are certain harms that are sufficient to allow the prohibition of a false statement and there are certain harms that are not sufficient, irrespective of what judgment Congress made about the significance of those harms. Is that -- is that accurate? But that's not -- the answer is would the First Amendment permit that. Well, that's sort of the question we have to answer here. [Laughter] Suppose what the person gets is -- is a date with a potential rich spouse. Would that be enough? Some people might have a different opinion. [Laughter] ",be your argument limit to statement that a person make about himself or herself what be the principal reason for draw the line there suppose the statute also make it a crime to represent falsely that someone else be the recipient of a military medal so that if someone say falsely and knowingly that a spouse or a parent or a child be a medal recipient that would also be cover that would be protect by the first amendment do you really think that there be that the first amendment that there be first amendment value in a bald face lie about a purely factual statement that a person make about himself because that person would like to create a particular persona gee i win the medal of honor i be a rhodes scholar i win the nobel prize there be a personal the first amendment protect that you acknowledge that the first amendment allow the prohibition or the regulation of false speech if it cause at least certain kind of harm and the problem i have with your argument be determine which harm you think count and which harm do not count would you go as far as be suggest earlier to say that only pecuniary harm count if you if you say that then the the classic case of intentional infliction of emotional distress be unconstitutional go up to someone and say falsely your your child have just be run over by a bus so how do we determine which harm be sufficient when you say imminent you mean what do you mean by that well if that be the standard then most of the prosecution for make false statement to a federal law enforcement officer be not go to survive be they well then you be not really talk about imminent harm i do not think you be just talk about harm it seem to me what you be argue be that we should determine that there be certain harm that be sufficient to allow the prohibition of a false statement and there be certain harm that be not sufficient irrespective of what judgment congress make about the significance of those harm be that be that accurate but that be not the answer be would the first amendment permit that well that be sort of the question we have to answer here laughter suppose what the person get be be a date with a potential rich spouse would that be enough some people might have a different opinion laughter ,156.01000000000005,Roberts Court,"Feb 22, 2012",United States,Xavier Alvarez,11-210,"Oct 17, 2011","Jun 28, 2012",112,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2011,PPL Montana v. Montana,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","On the issue of whether we should look to the segments or to the river as a whole, what authorities can we consult? You rely heavily on U.S. v. Utah, and that certainly is a relevant precedent; but there is disagreement about what it means and the only authority that I see that U.S. v. Utah cited was The Montello, which seems to cite nothing whatsoever. So where do we -- is that the end of the trail? Is there anyplace else we can look? All of this, I take it, derives from the rule that preexisted -- preexisted the adoption of the Constitution, that the sovereign owned the navigable rivers within its borders. Is there some body of common law that addresses this, that would shed some light on whether that means the whole river or it means segments? So what -- what is the origin of the rule that the original 13 States owned the navigable rivers or parts of the rivers, but not the parts that weren't. That was some feature of American colonial law? I don't see why portage is relevant at all. What is the basis for the rule that I assume it's the sovereign owns the navigable rivers? I assume it's because they are viewed, they were viewed as highways for transportation and commerce. And to the extent that there is an obstruction that cannot be traversed by a boat, then there isn't going to be any commerce or transportation along that area. Now there might be an argument that the sovereign should own the land next to the river so that you could portage around it, but what, what would be the justification for saying the sovereign owns the portion of the river that can't be traversed at all by boat? I just don't understand it. What -- what do you understand to be the reason for the rule that the States own the navigable rivers? What do fishing and navigation have to do -- for -- what does fishing have to do with navigability? Let me put it this way. Why -- why should -- why does the State own a navigable river but not a non-navigable river? Yes, and if that's the reason -- if that's the reason for the rule, than what is the justification for State ownership of a portion of the river that is not navigable? The rule that you are arguing for might be an established rule that we should follow, but as a matter of theory I don't understand what the justification is for State ownership of a non-navigable portion of the river if the reason for the underlying rule is so that people will not put up obstructions on the river so that they -- it can be maintained as an -- as an avenue of commerce. I can see that you -- why the State would own that, because otherwise riparian owners could put up fences and obstructions and charge tolls and -- and that sort of thing; but if it's not navigable I don't see what it has to do with -- with commerce or transportation.

2011,Arizona v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, before you move on to the registration requirement, could I take you back to an example that's similar to the one that Justice Breyer was referring to. Let's someone -- let's say someone who is a citizen and a resident of New Mexico, has a New Mexico driver's license, drives across the border, is stopped for speeding, not 60 miles an hour in a 20-mile zone, but 10 miles over the speed limit on an interstate. And the officer, for some reason, thinks that this person may be an illegal alien. How would that work out? If you do the records check, you're not going to get anything back, right, because the person is a citizen? So what -- where would the officer take it from there? Why would it dispel reasonable suspicion if it's -- if the officer knows it's a state that issues driver's licenses to aliens who are not lawfully-- --That may be the case, and I would like to ask General Verrilli about that; but, under the Fourth Amendment, presumably, if the officer can arrest, the state officer can arrest a person simply on the ground that the person is removable, which is what the Office of Legal Counsel opined some years ago, then presumably the officer could continue to detain that individual that I mentioned until they reached a point where the Terry stop becomes an arrest, at which time they would have to have probable cause. But if they had probable cause to believe the person was removable, then they could hold the person, presumably, until the person's status was completely verified; isn't that correct? Well, in that-- --In that regard, we are told that there are some important categories of aliens who can't obtain registration, cannot obtain Federal registration, and yet they are people that nobody would think should be removed. I think someone with a pending asylum application would fall into that category. How would section 3 apply there? Well, of course, if you've entered the country illegally, you can't get a registration. But-- --I understand that. I understand the distinction you're drawing, that you can't be prosecuted for lack of a registration if you couldn't have gotten a registration. Right. Well, I have the same question as the Chief Justice. Suppose that the Federal Government changed its priorities tomorrow, and it said -- they threw out the ones they have now, and they said the new policy is maximum enforcement, we want to know about every person who's stopped or arrested, we want to -- we want to their immigration status verified. Would the Arizona law then be un-preempted? Well, suppose that every -- suppose every law enforcement officer in Arizona saw things exactly the same way as the Arizona legislature. And so, without any direction from the legislature, they all took it upon themselves to make these inquiries every time they stopped somebody or arrested somebody. Would that be a violation of Federal law? But what if they said, well, we don't care at your priorities are; we have our priorities, and our priority is maximum enforcement, and we're going to call you in every case? It was all done on an individual basis, all the officers were individually doing it-- --that would be okay? That's what I can't understand because your argument -- you seem to be saying that what's wrong with the Arizona law is that the Arizona legislature is trying to control what its employees are doing, and they have to be free to disregard the desires of the Arizona legislature, for whom they work, and follow the priorities of the Federal Government, for whom they don't work. Well, could I ask you this about 2, before you move on to that? How is a -- this is just a matter of information. How can a state officer who stops somebody or who arrests somebody for a nonimmigration offense tell whether that person falls within the Federal removal priorities without making an inquiry to the Federal Government? For example, I understand one of the priorities is people who have previously been removed, then that might be somebody who you would want to arrest and -- and remove. But how can you determine that without making the -- the inquiry in the first place? Well, what if they just, they stop somebody for a traffic violation, but they want to know whether this is a person who previously was removed and has come back or somebody who has just -- just within the last few hours possibly come -- well, let's just -- somebody who's previously been removed? How can you know that without making an inquiry? ",well before you move on to the registration requirement could i take you back to an example that be similar to the one that justice breyer be refer to let us someone let us say someone who be a citizen and a resident of new mexico have a new mexico driver s license drive across the border be stop for speed not mile an hour in a mile zone but mile over the speed limit on an interstate and the officer for some reason think that this person may be an illegal alien how would that work out if you do the record check you be not go to get anything back right because the person be a citizen so what where would the officer take it from there why would it dispel reasonable suspicion if it be if the officer know it be a state that issue driver s license to alien who be not lawfully that may be the case and i would like to ask general verrilli about that but under the fourth amendment presumably if the officer can arrest the state officer can arrest a person simply on the ground that the person be removable which be what the office of legal counsel opine some year ago then presumably the officer could continue to detain that individual that i mention until they reach a point where the terry stop become an arrest at which time they would have to have probable because but if they have probable because to believe the person be removable then they could hold the person presumably until the person s status be completely verify be not that correct well in that in that regard we be tell that there be some important category of alien who can not obtain registration can not obtain federal registration and yet they be people that nobody would think should be remove i think someone with a pending asylum application would fall into that category how would section apply there well of course if you have enter the country illegally you can not get a registration but i understand that i understand the distinction you be draw that you can not be prosecute for lack of a registration if you could not have get a registration right well i have the same question as the chief justice suppose that the federal government change its priority tomorrow and it say they throw out the one they have now and they say the new policy be maximum enforcement we want to know about every person who be stop or arrest we want to we want to their immigration status verify would the arizona law then be un preempt well suppose that every suppose every law enforcement officer in arizona saw thing exactly the same way as the arizona legislature and so without any direction from the legislature they all take it upon themselves to make these inquiry every time they stop somebody or arrest somebody would that be a violation of federal law but what if they say well we do not care at your priority be we have our priority and our priority be maximum enforcement and we be go to call you in every case it be all do on an individual basis all the officer we be individually do it that would be okay that be what i can not understand because your argument you seem to be say that what be wrong with the arizona law be that the arizona legislature be try to control what its employee be do and they have to be free to disregard the desire of the arizona legislature for whom they work and follow the priority of the federal government for whom they do not work well could i ask you this about before you move on to that how be a this be just a matter of information how can a state officer who stop somebody or who arrest somebody for a nonimmigration offense tell whether that person fall within the federal removal priority without make an inquiry to the federal government for example i understand one of the priority be people who have previously be remove then that might be somebody who you would want to arrest and and remove but how can you determine that without make the the inquiry in the first place well what if they just they stop somebody for a traffic violation but they want to know whether this be a person who previously be remove and have come back or somebody who have just just within the last few hour possibly come well let us just somebody who be previously be remove how can you know that without make an inquiry ,266.97,Roberts Court,"Apr 25, 2012",Arizona et al.,United States,11-182,"Dec 9, 2011","Jun 25, 2012",112,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2011,Messerschmidt v. Millender,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","There is something very strange about the rule we are applying here. A warrant was issued by a judge in the Superior Court, isn't that right. And -- and so that judge, who is a lawyer and was appointed as a judge and presumably has some familiarity with the Fourth Amendment, found that there was probable cause to search for all of these things. And now we are asking whether a reasonable police officer who is not a lawyer and certainly is not a judge should have been able to see that this call that was made by a judge was not only wrong but so wrong that it -- you couldn't reasonably think that the judge might be correct. Is there some way to phrase this, if this rule is to be retained in any form, is there some way to phrase it so that it is narrowed appropriately? Is it the case here that a reasonably well trained officer would not -- would understand that this warrant was defective in authorizing a search for guns other than the shotgun in question when a provision of the California Penal Code says that a search warrant may be issued to seize items intended for use in committing a crime? You have your client who has discharged a sawed-off shotgun at his former girlfriend in an attempt to kill her. And he is known to be a member of a violent gang, and he has threatened to kill her, and so a reasonable police officer would -- could not think, well, he might have some other guns and he -- and there would be an intent to use those in the commission of the crime that he has threatened to commit. I'm sorry. Excuse me. Mr. Bowen-- --Well, that was just -- that a misstatement on my part. He could not think that about Mr. Bowen? All right. It was found that there was probable cause to believe that he was living in these premises, isn't that correct? And you're not contesting that. It's not an issue before us. Well, on the assumption that he was living in those premises, then what is wrong with a reasonable officer thinking: He's tried to kill her in the past using one gun; he's a member of a gang; he is very likely to have -- to possess or have access to other guns; those other guns may be found in the home where we believe he is living, and he is intending to use them to carry out the threat that he has promised, the threat that he has made? What about the gang paraphernalia? Why couldn't an officer reasonably believe that there was a probable cause to seize that -- to search for and seize that, because it would link Mr. Bowen with this residence where they hoped to find the shotgun? And you dispute the fact that he is -- that he is associated with that residence. Then why couldn't a reasonable officer think that that would be the case here. No, well, if they have probable cause to believe that the sawed-off shotgun is there; let's suppose they find the sawed-off shotgun. Then there's going to be an issue at trial: was it his sawed-off shotgun? And anything that links him to that residence is valuable evidence. I thought this was a test of what they could -- what a reasonable officer could have believed, not what they in particular believed? Well, to come back to a question that was asked before-- --suppose they were issuing -- suppose the warrant just sought this -- the -- that particular weapon. They execute it, and they come to a room in this house and it's got Mr. Bowen's name on it, and inside there is a gun cabinet and there are -- there's -- there are a whole -- there is a whole array of guns, legal -- let's say he legally possesses them. There's a -- there's a -- these are assault rifles, there are pistols; and it's known that he's threatened to kill his girlfriend. You say -- would the police be able to seize those? All right. All sorts of legal weapons-- --that could be used. Could they -- could they seize those? Let's-- --I am hypothesizing-- --he has a license for all of these. He's not-- --The circumstances are exactly the circumstances here-- --except for the two things that I changed. It's his room, and it's his gun cabinet. What happens if they don't find him? He is still at large. They have to leave the weapons there? --why? On what grounds could they seize them? It's his room. They can't say we are going to take them under -- we're going to take them so that he can't use those to kill his girlfriend which is what he has threatened to do? They just have to leave them there-- --and if he happens to come back and -- and get those weapons, and he kills her, well, that's just too bad? You really -- you really are not answering my question. My question is: everything is exactly the same except that it's his room and he's not a felon and he possesses them legally and there they are and they see them. And your answer is they can take them; in which case my question is, why wouldn't they have probable cause to search for those in the first place? Or they can't take them, in which case I say well, what about the possibility that he will come back, get those weapons and carry out his threat using those weapons?

2011,Astrue v. Capato,112,"Samuel A.

Would that mean that they would be ineligible for survivors' benefits? But what if they did -- what if they did that? Maybe it means something else. Maybe it means that to the Congress that initially enacted the predecessor of this provision a child was a child. They knew what a child was. And the type of child that I mentioned earlier was a child. There wasn't a need for any definition of that. And they -- they never had any inkling about the situation that has arisen in this case, just as they had no inkling that any State would go off and take away intestacy rights for children born to married people during the course of their marriage. Why doesn't the last sentence of -- what is it -- (h)(2)(A) show that Congress had in mind a certain idea of a category of people who were indisputably children? I don't see how you can get around that. Because it says what you are looking for under State law is to determine whether someone has the same status relative to taking intestate personal property as a child. So if the person is a child, you have applicants who according to State law had the same status as a child, a person has that status because the person is a child, and the person is deemed to be a child -- it seems very clear that that shows that (h), that this provision is directed to people that Congress in 1939 did not think fell within this paradigm of a child.

If we were to look at all the statutes of limitations in the -- in the U.S. Code, we would find that they are generally or exclusively drafted like section 1658, the general statute of limitations provisions, and are geared to or are triggered by the accrual of the action rather than some event? Before you turn away from the statute of repose, could I just ask you one more question-- --on -- on that? If -- if 16(a) reports are not filed, how likely is it that a potential 16(b) plaintiff will find out within the 2-year period that there were these trades? What would -- what are the other filings that might disclose this? Well, if you were drafting a statute of repose, how would you phrase it other than the way this is phrased? Before you get to that, do you have an example of a -- a classic statute of repose that we -- I could look at to see how they should be phrased, and not one that says that there shall be tolling -- there shall not be tolling except in some circumstances, one that just says, ""this is it; no tolling whatsoever? "" Right. A standalone provision. Now why is that true? Somebody could be a -- an insider without knowing that the person was an insider. No, I understand that. But I thought the point was -- I thought the question was whether there is the kind of concealment that would invoke equitable tolling when the concealment is not done knowingly, when it is not done in -- in knowing breach of a disclosure obligation. Well, what about as a matter of language, whether or not 16b is a -- whether it's a statute of a repose or a statute of limitations, it tells you exactly when the time is supposed to begin to run, from the -- from the realization of the profit. And you want to say no, it doesn't begin to run from that point, it begins to run from the point when some other completely different external event occurs, if it ever does occur, which is the filing of the 16a report. Texturally, how do you get to that? And it requires actual -- is that right? It requires actual knowledge on the part of the plaintiff? Does that make any sense, given the -- the class of individuals who are plaintiffs in 16(b) cases?

2011,Miller v. Alabama,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","If you could write the opinion for us, what would you hold? What's -- what's the definition of a child for that purpose? So, you -- you would hold you can't -- there cannot be a sentence of life imprisonment without parole for anyone under 15, but for anybody over 15, it would be permissible. Can you tell us where the age line needs to be drawn for constitutional purposes? That's where you think the logic of your argument leads. And you would say that a 17 -- a person of 17 years and 10 months, 11 months, who commits the worst possible string of offenses still -- and demonstrates great maturity -- still cannot be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. What do you mean when you say that, that they have not addressed it? If State law allows it, have they not addressed it? So, legislators don't understand that their law permits this? But I don't really understand this argument. You mean the legislatures have enacted these laws, but they don't realize that, under these laws, a -- a person under the age of 18 may be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for -- for murder. They don't understand that? If you think these legislators don't understand what their laws provide, why don't you contact them? And when they -- when you tell them, do you realize that in your State a -- a 16-year-old or a 17-year-old may be sentenced to life in prison without parole for murder, they'll say: Oh, my gosh, I never realized that. Let's change the law. So, they've made a decision on this. Now maybe it's a bad decision-- --but I really don't understand how you can argue that they have not made a decision on this-- --and they are not aware of what their law provides. And you think there is a difference between the State that says expressly a juvenile below a certain age may be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole and a State that says that if a person is convicted of capital murder, that sentence may be imposed and, in another -- in another provision, says that juveniles may be transferred for prosecution as adults. There's a difference between those two? It's not even for homicide offenses that would qualify for life imprisonment without parole for an adult. It's for any non-negligent homicide; isn't that right? In Graham, didn't the Court reject the idea of individualized sentencing in which youth would be taken into account on a case-by-case basis? If we look to objective indicia, as all of the cases in this line have, what is the lowest age as to which you can say there is any indication of a societal consensus that this is okay? Would it be 14? How many States allow it for a 13-year-old or a 12-year-old? 10 states will allow it for a 12-year-old. How many would allow it for a 13-year-old? Do you happen to know? Do you think the legislators in Pennsylvania and Michigan don't understand what their laws provide? Is that what -- is that true under the law of Arkansas? In most jurisdictions, I would think if -- if someone's charged with the highest degree of homicide, the defense can request an instruction on -- you don't have to have a separate charge on a lesser included offense; the defense can request an instruction on lesser included offenses if it could be supported by the evidence. So, you would draw the line at -- at a specific intent to kill? What if it was a lot clearer? What if they had said, okay, before we go in, let's understand what's going on here; Shields has got -- has got the sawed-off shotgun, and if we need to use it, we'll use it; we'll do whatever it takes to -- to bring this off? There might not be a specific intent-- --to kill there. It's arrests to start out with, it's not -- it's not convictions. And it's not for the type of offense for which one could be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole, it's a broader category of homicide offenses. Is it true that in the States that permit life without parole for a minor homicide -- a minor murder, a person -- a minor convicted of -- of murder, that that is permitted for every non-negligent homicide? Some States, but not in all-- --So you have a very imprecise denominator, you have arrests for a broader category of offenses.

2011,Filarsky v. Delia,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Why does it matter whether the privately retained attorney works in close cooperation with government employees? Suppose in this case Mr. Filarsky had simply been hired to go off and perform this investigation, and at the end of the investigation report the results to the town? Would the case come out differently then? Suppose -- suppose the government hires an attorney to do an independent investigation; it hires an outside attorney precisely because it does not want to be faced with allegations that it has manipulated the outcome of the investigation because its own conduct is at issue. So they say, you are going to be independent, hands-off, we are not going to interfere at all. But that would still in your -- in your submission satisfy the coordination requirement? What is the difference between that and the prison situation? The private prison -- the guard in the private prison is performing a function that has been delegated to that or assumed by that entity pursuant to a contract. I don't understand exactly what the difference is. Well, what about your test? What is your test? Well, suppose you have a lawyer who is a part-time employee. Does that matter? A part-time employee of government unit. So the difference, your difference, is between an employee and an independent contractor? Isn't that often a very difficult determination under the law? There are a lot of -- there are a lot of -- I think -- well, there are a lot of law firms. I think all law firms other than public interest firms are for-profit firms, and the attorneys are part-time employees of municipalities and other government units to perform various functions, part-time judges, part-time prosecutors. Well, now you're talking about history. But I want to know how -- how the courts are to determine and why it should matter how a municipality sets this up. Suppose the town had hired Mr. Filarsky as a part-time town employee. So he has the certain -- he has a one year contract or six month contract or something for a certain amount of money to perform services for a certain number of hours. You would say that he would be entitled to qualified immunity then? Why? He's an employee. They passed a resolution saying he's an employee of the town. I thought there was a distinction between employees and independent contractors. Is that the distinction you are drawing or not? You are saying it's clearly established that there isn't a difference between going in and looking for the insulation, et cetera, and telling him to bring it out. Because they clearly established the -- that as a condition of employment in a situation like this, the employee cannot be required to submit to a search? But the Court's cases are a mix of history and -- and policy. The Court has recognized both absolute immunity -- has recognized absolute immunity in instances where there wasn't absolute immunity at common law; isn't that true? Suppose a municipality were to -- or a State were to abolish all civil service rules and all the special rules and go back to employment at will for government employees, would that -- would that take with it the whole qualified immunity regime? It seems strange, because the immunities -- at least some of the immunities -- long predate the establishment -- the institution of the civil service system. Everybody is subject to market forces. Every person who works is influenced by market forces to some degree, isn't that correct? Well, the political appointees within the United States Department of Justice are not protected by civil service, so should they lack immunity? They are subject to market forces, aren't they? ",why do it matter whether the privately retain attorney work in close cooperation with government employee suppose in this case mr filarsky have simply be hire to go off and perform this investigation and at the end of the investigation report the result to the town would the case come out differently then suppose suppose the government hire an attorney to do an independent investigation it hire an outside attorney precisely because it do not want to be face with allegation that it have manipulate the outcome of the investigation because its own conduct be at issue so they say you be go to be independent hand off we be not go to interfere at all but that would still in your in your submission satisfy the coordination requirement what be the difference between that and the prison situation the private prison the guard in the private prison be perform a function that have be delegate to that or assume by that entity pursuant to a contract i do not understand exactly what the difference be well what about your test what be your test well suppose you have a lawyer who be a part time employee do that matter a part time employee of government unit so the difference your difference be between an employee and an independent contractor be not that often a very difficult determination under the law there be a lot of there be a lot of i think well there be a lot of law firm i think all law firm other than public interest firm be for profit firm and the attorney be part time employee of municipality and other government unit to perform various function part time judge part time prosecutor well now you be talk about history but i want to know how how the court be to determine and why it should matter how a municipality set this up suppose the town have hire mr filarsky as a part time town employee so he have the certain he have a one year contract or six month contract or something for a certain amount of money to perform service for a certain number of hour you would say that he would be entitle to qualify immunity then why he be an employee they pass a resolution say he be an employee of the town i think there be a distinction between employee and independent contractor be that the distinction you be draw or not you be say it be clearly establish that there be not a difference between go in and look for the insulation et cetera and tell him to bring it out because they clearly establish the that as a condition of employment in a situation like this the employee can not be require to submit to a search but the court s case be a mix of history and and policy the court have recognize both absolute immunity have recognize absolute immunity in instance where there be not absolute immunity at common law be not that true suppose a municipality we be to or a state we be to abolish all civil service rule and all the special rule and go back to employment at will for government employee would that would that take with it the whole qualified immunity regime it seem strange because the immunity at least some of the immunity long predate the establishment the institution of the civil service system everybody be subject to market force every person who work be influence by market force to some degree be not that correct well the political appointee within the united state department of justice be not protect by civil service so should they lack immunity they be subject to market force be not they ,217.14,Roberts Court,"Jan 17, 2012",Steve A.

2011,Douglas v. Independent Living Center of Southern California,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Are you asking us to adopt a rule that is good for this one case only? You gave -- or is there -- could you state the rule in broader terms or more neutral terms? And you gave three reasons why we should reverse. One, Congress hasn't created a cause of action here. Well, Congress has never created causes of action, never creates a cause of action in any case in the Ex parte Young line or cases like that. The Supremacy Clause, because this is a Spending Clause, this was an act under the Spending Clause. But you are not asking us to hold that a Spending Clause legislation can never preempt State legislation, I take it. And then the language of 30(A), where you -- are you arguing that 30 -- that the Medicaid Act affirmatively precludes any action like this. I don't understand that. Is -- is any of those arguments sufficient by itself, or do you have to take them all together, and you are asking for a rule that only applies here? Well, suppose the plaintiffs here were facing an imminent State enforcement action. Would your argument be different? But how does that square with the argument that you made relying on separation of powers, Spending Clause and the language of 30(A)? All of those are still in play-- --in that situation. What is your response to the argument that the equitable power exercised in Ex parte Young and similar cases is limited to certain specific situations such as where there is an imminent threat of the State enforcement action, and a few others where there is a trespass, where there's a clearly defined Federal right. I mean, it doesn't encompass every situation in which the plaintiff simply has Article III standing and wants to obtain an injunction that a particular State law is preempted by a Federal law. What happens when the agency approves rates and someone is dissatisfied with the rate sues and says these rates are ridiculously low? They can still bring a suit-- --Well, how do you know they're going to lose the litigation? Why should they lose the litigation if it's really -- if there really is a cause of action there?

2011,Lafler v. Cooper,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","I mean, all of this is theoretically interesting and it may be that capital cases are sui generis here. But I thought the heart of your argument was that there just is no way to unscramble the eggs in this situation; there is no -- and that was your third point, I understood it-- --there is no remedy that can put the parties back into the position where they would have been had the error regarding the legal issue not occurred. The Court has said that death is different. Do you think it is inconceivable that there could be a different rule for capital cases, such as a rule requiring that in a capital case any offer of a noncapital sentence as part of the plea bargain can actually be waived by the defendant in court so that this doesn't come up? This is not a capital case. The relief that you want is specific performance on the plea bargain. Isn't that correct? What if it had come to light, come to the prosecutor's attention during this intervening time, that your client had committed four or five other shootings? Would you still be entitled to specific performance? I mean, that's pretty incredible. It doesn't matter what the defendant has done in the -- has been discovered to have done in the interim. Committed five murders, ten murders? Wipe it out of your mind; you get -- you get the plea bargain that was offered at an early point in -- in the investigation of the case? Well, I don't know if that's going to be so hard to show. Do you think it's feasible to draw a distinction between this case, where there was arguably inaccurate legal advice, and the case in which the defense attorney simply makes a terribly mistaken calculation about the chances of a favorable verdict at trial? A favorable plea bargain is offered, caps the guy's possible sentence at let's say three years. The defense attorney says, we've got a great shot at an acquittal, let's go to trial. I'm going to rip the prosecution's witnesses apart. The trial turns out to be a disaster. Convicted on all counts. 25 years. Do you think that it's impossible for the rule that you want us to adopt here to be applied in that situation as well? --a situation where the -- where the defendant turns down -- where a plea is turned down and the defendant goes to trial, are there any facts in -- any facts that would make any remedy other than specific performance the correct remedy in that situation? You're recommend -- you're recommending specific performance as the remedy for your case, and I agree with you that is, if there is to be a remedy, it's the only remedy that makes a -- any modicum of sense. The remedy of giving a new trial when the person has already had a fair trial makes zero sense. So what I'm looking for is any situation -- you said leave it to the discretion of the trial judge. But what is -- what discretion is there? What remedy in that situation other than specific performance would be an appropriate -- would remedy what you claim to have been the violation? Do you think the length and the complexity of the trial has any bearing on this? This was a relatively short and simple trial. But let's say a prosecutor offers a plea deal in a case in which the trial is going to take 6 months and it's going to cost a million dollars and if they try that case, there are going to be other cases that they won't be able to try. The plea is rejected, the case is tried, and then afterwards the -- the remedy is to -- to -- to reinstate this plea offer, which was predicated on the relieving the prosecutor of the burden of having to try that case. ",i mean all of this be theoretically interesting and it may be that capital case be sui generis here but i think the heart of your argument be that there just be no way to unscramble the egg in this situation there be no and that be your third point i understand it there be no remedy that can put the party back into the position where they would have be have the error regard the legal issue not occur the court have say that death be different do you think it be inconceivable that there could be a different rule for capital case such as a rule require that in a capital case any offer of a noncapital sentence as part of the plea bargain can actually be waive by the defendant in court so that this do not come up this be not a capital case the relief that you want be specific performance on the plea bargain be not that correct what if it have come to light come to the prosecutor s attention during this intervening time that your client have commit four or five other shooting would you still be entitle to specific performance i mean that be pretty incredible it do not matter what the defendant have do in the have be discover to have do in the interim committed five murder ten murder wipe it out of your mind you get you get the plea bargain that be offer at an early point in in the investigation of the case well i do not know if that be go to be so hard to show do you think it be feasible to draw a distinction between this case where there be arguably inaccurate legal advice and the case in which the defense attorney simply make a terribly mistake calculation about the chance of a favorable verdict at trial a favorable plea bargain be offer cap the guy s possible sentence at let us say three year the defense attorney say we have get a great shot at an acquittal let us go to trial I be go to rip the prosecution s witness apart the trial turn out to be a disaster convict on all count year do you think that it be impossible for the rule that you want us to adopt here to be apply in that situation as well a situation where the where the defendant turn down where a plea be turn down and the defendant go to trial be there any fact in any fact that would make any remedy other than specific performance the correct remedy in that situation you be recommend you be recommend specific performance as the remedy for your case and i agree with you that be if there be to be a remedy it be the only remedy that make a any modicum of sense the remedy of give a new trial when the person have already have a fair trial make zero sense so what I be look for be any situation you say leave it to the discretion of the trial judge but what be what discretion be there what remedy in that situation other than specific performance would be an appropriate would remedy what you claim to have be the violation do you think the length and the complexity of the trial have any bearing on this this be a relatively short and simple trial but let us say a prosecutor offer a plea deal in a case in which the trial be go to take month and it be go to cost a million dollar and if they try that case there be go to be other case that they will not be able to try the plea be reject the case be try and then afterwards the the remedy be to to to reinstate this plea offer which be predicate on the relieve the prosecutor of the burden of have to try that case ,220.14,Roberts Court,"Oct 31, 2011","Blaine Lafler, Warden",Anthony Cooper,10-209,"Jan 7, 2011","Mar 21, 2012",112,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2011,Perry v. New Hampshire,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","I take it from your -- I take it from your answers that simple unreliability is not enough. If there's testimony-- --eyewitness testimony that seems of very dubious unreliability, that cannot be excluded. Something more is needed. Something more is needed; suggestiveness is needed. But suggestiveness doesn't require any police involvement? Is that right? Can you just define what you mean by suggestiveness? Yes, but those are all situations where the police is involved, the police are involved. Well, what if you have cross-racial identification? Would that qualify on the ground that studies have shown that those may be less reliable. I understand that, but I need to know what you mean by suggestiveness. What does that mean? Can you just give me a definition of it? What does that mean? That would be really a great change from the way trials are now conducted, wouldn't it. Let me give you this example. A victim is raped and the victim doesn't really have a very good opportunity to see the perpetrator. It's dark, the person has a mask and so forth. A couple of weeks go by and the victim reads on article in the paper that says so-and-so has been arrested for a rape in another part of the city. There is a picture of that person in the paper and the victim says, that's the person who raped me. Now, you want to make it possible for the judge to say that victim may not testify and identify the person that that person -- that the victim says was the perpetrator of the rape, on the ground that the newspaper picture was suggestive, even though there wasn't any police involvement and when you look at all the circumstances, the identification is unreliable. Now, maybe that's a good system, but that is a drastic change, is it not, from the way criminal trials are now conducted? Do you know of cases like that in which the judge has said that eyewitness identification cannot come in? What you're saying -- what you're saying seems to suggest that the rule we're talking about here is really not an aspect of due process per se, but, like the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule, it's a special due process exclusionary rule that is meant to deter conduct that could result in a constitutional violation. Is that right? If -- if the exclusionary aspect of this is not part of due process itself, then doesn't it follow that what due process requires is reliability? So doesn't that mean that the Petitioner's argument is correct, the due process standard is simply reliability, not suggestiveness? You -- you have two cases. You have Mr. Perry's case and you have another case that's very similar. In fact, it's identical, except that in that instance the police officer talking to the witness said, would you take a look out the window and see if you recognize anybody. Now, from the perspective of the defendants, the cases are -- seem -- as far as whether they get a fair trial, the cases are identical, are they not? The evidence is the same. The suggestiveness is the same. I was intrigued by what your brief said about Federal Rule of Evidence 403. Do you think that a Federal judge under that rule may exclude the testimony of a witness on the ground that the witness is, in the judgment of the trial judge, completely unbelievable? But you think in theory that could be done? So if you put on a cooperating witness in the case and this witness has made 100 inconsistent statements previously and has been convicted of perjury, that the judge can just say you can't put that witness on because that person is -- is a liar, and I'm not going to have the witness testify in my courtroom? There surely is some minimal due process requirement for the admission of evidence, isn't there? Are you saying there is none? If the State abolished the hearsay rule, could it -- would it not be a violation of due process if the prosecution introduced quadruple hearsay? Let me give -- you're right. Let me give you another example. Let's say you have -- the State puts on a witness who -- who says this person did it because I saw it in my crystal ball. ",i take it from your i take it from your answer that simple unreliability be not enough if there be testimony eyewitness testimony that seem of very dubious unreliability that can not be exclude something more be need something more be need suggestiveness be need but suggestiveness do not require any police involvement be that right can you just define what you mean by suggestiveness yes but those be all situation where the police be involve the police be involve well what if you have cross racial identification would that qualify on the ground that study have show that those may be less reliable i understand that but i need to know what you mean by suggestiveness what do that mean can you just give me a definition of it what do that mean that would be really a great change from the way trial be now conduct would not it let me give you this example a victim be rap and the victim do not really have a very good opportunity to see the perpetrator it have dark the person have a mask and so forth a couple of week go by and the victim read on article in the paper that say so and so have be arrest for a rape in another part of the city there be a picture of that person in the paper and the victim say that be the person who rap me now you want to make it possible for the judge to say that victim may not testify and identify the person that that person that the victim say be the perpetrator of the rape on the ground that the newspaper picture be suggestive even though there be not any police involvement and when you look at all the circumstance the identification be unreliable now maybe that be a good system but that be a drastic change be it not from the way criminal trial be now conduct do you know of case like that in which the judge have say that eyewitness identification can not come in what you be say what you be say seem to suggest that the rule we be talk about here be really not an aspect of due process per se but like the fourth amendment exclusionary rule it be a special due process exclusionary rule that be mean to deter conduct that could result in a constitutional violation be that right if if the exclusionary aspect of this be not part of due process itself then do not it follow that what due process require be reliability so do not that mean that the petitioner s argument be correct the due process standard be simply reliability not suggestiveness you you have two case you have mr perry s case and you have another case that be very similar in fact it be identical except that in that instance the police officer talk to the witness say would you take a look out the window and see if you recognize anybody now from the perspective of the defendant the case be seem as far as whether they get a fair trial the case be identical be they not the evidence be the same the suggestiveness be the same i be intrigue by what your brief say about federal rule of evidence do you think that a federal judge under that rule may exclude the testimony of a witness on the ground that the witness be in the judgment of the trial judge completely unbelievable but you think in theory that could be do so if you put on a cooperate witness in the case and this witness have make inconsistent statement previously and have be convict of perjury that the judge can just say you can not put that witness on because that person be be a liar and I be not go to have the witness testify in my courtroom there surely be some minimal due process requirement for the admission of evidence be not there be you say there be none if the state abolish the hearsay rule could it would it not be a violation of due process if the prosecution introduce quadruple hearsay let me give you be right let me give you another example let us say you have the state put on a witness who who say this person do it because i saw it in my crystal ball ,238.91000000000003,Roberts Court,"Nov 2, 2011",Barion Perry,New Hampshire,10-8974,"May 31, 2011","Jan 11, 2012",112,0.0,1.0,0.0,0
2011,Blueford v. Arkansas,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","I think you've conceded away your case when you say that. The one characteristic of a verdict that seems perfectly clear to me is that it is final. The jury can't render a verdict and be discharged and then come back the next day and say, you know what, some of us -- one of us has changed his mind or her mind. It's the final vote. And so why isn't the critical question here whether what the -- what the foreperson said was, this is our final vote, we're not going to go back, this is it; or this is the way we voted, now and it's -- one or more of us may have wanted to -- wanted to retain the right, reserve the right to go back and -- and vote again. Are you saying that there was no manifest necessity to declare a mistrial as to any count, in which case there could be no retrial whatsoever, or no manifest necessity to declare a mistrial on capital murder. And if you're saying the latter, then what would you have us do with the decision by the Arkansas Supreme Court that Arkansas law does not allow a partial verdict? Is this a fair explanation of Arkansas law which doesn't seem to me to be perfectly clear? What the jury is supposed to do is to vote on the greatest offense first and reach a reasonably firm vote. And if they reach a reasonably firm vote that is unanimous not guilty, then they can move on to the next -- to the lower offenses, but that reasonably firm vote is not an absolutely final vote, and there is still the possibility for the jury to go back. Is that a correct understanding? For double jeopardy purposes, is the question what Arkansas law actually says, or what the jury understood Arkansas law to be? In Green and Price, the defendants were tried once on the greater offense, and jeopardy terminated without a finding of manifest necessity regarding the termination of jeopardy. To me that is the sound basis for those decisions. But I have to agree with what Justice Kagan said. The Justice Black's reasoning in Green, that the jury impliedly acquitted the defendant of the greater offense by convicting the defendant of the lesser offense doesn't really make any sense because they could have simply been in disagreement about the greater offense. ",i think you have concede away your case when you say that the one characteristic of a verdict that seem perfectly clear to me be that it be final the jury can not render a verdict and be discharge and then come back the next day and say you know what some of us one of us have change his mind or her mind it be the final vote and so why be not the critical question here whether what the what the foreperson say be this be our final vote we be not go to go back this be it or this be the way we vote now and it be one or more of us may have want to want to retain the right reserve the right to go back and and vote again be you say that there be no manifest necessity to declare a mistrial as to any count in which case there could be no retrial whatsoever or no manifest necessity to declare a mistrial on capital murder and if you be say the latter then what would you have us do with the decision by the arkansas supreme court that arkansas law do not allow a partial verdict be this a fair explanation of arkansas law which do not seem to me to be perfectly clear what the jury be suppose to do be to vote on the great offense first and reach a reasonably firm vote and if they reach a reasonably firm vote that be unanimous not guilty then they can move on to the next to the low offense but that reasonably firm vote be not an absolutely final vote and there be still the possibility for the jury to go back be that a correct understanding for double jeopardy purpose be the question what arkansas law actually say or what the jury understand arkansas law to be in green and price the defendant we be try once on the great offense and jeopardy terminate without a finding of manifest necessity regard the termination of jeopardy to me that be the sound basis for those decision but i have to agree with what justice kagan say the justice black s reasoning in green that the jury impliedly acquit the defendant of the great offense by convict the defendant of the less offense do not really make any sense because they could have simply be in disagreement about the great offense ,153.01000000000005,Roberts Court,"Feb 22, 2012",Alex Blueford,Arkansas,10-1320,"Oct 11, 2011","May 24, 2012",112,0.0,1.0,0.0,0

That's a very far-reaching proposition that extends well beyond claims of ineffective assistance of counsel at trial, wouldn't it? If many years after someone is convicted an allegation is made that the prosecution failed to turn over exculpatory evidence and that the information supporting the claim has just recently come to light and could not have been previously discovered, there would be a right to counsel there; wouldn't that be the case? What if the -- I'm sorry. What if the ineffective assistance of counsel claim is closely related to other claims that Petitioner wants to raise in an initial post-conviction relief proceeding? Counsel at trial was ineffective for failing to do A, B, C and D, and all of those are bases for relief. And now I want to argue with new counsel in the first post-conviction proceeding not only that counsel was ineffective at trial, but also that all these other claims are meritorious. Are you saying that the counsel to whom the Petitioner has a right is limited to making only the ineffective assistance of counsel claim and cannot go on and represent the Petitioner on these other claims? Why isn't that where your argument leads, to the proposition that you can never procedurally default irrevocably an ineffective assistance of counsel claim? But there can't be a claim-- --What I understand you to be saying is exactly that. A line has to be drawn somewhere; enough is enough; it can't go on forever.

It's exactly the same argument, except where the law stands now the line is drawn at a different place on the same principle. It has to be drawn someplace. If there is a right to counsel whenever someone asserts a claim that couldn't have been raised earlier, why does the State not have the obligation to provide counsel to contest the constitutionality of the representation that was provided on appeal? A trial judge doesn't have to be wrong for there to be ineffective assistance of counsel claim at trial? The question is whether there is cause external to Petitioner to overcome procedural default. If you went down that road, with Petitioner representing himself or herself, not have to show that: I would have raised a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel and I would have won on that were it not for the fact that the State appointed counsel for me and led me astray and prevented me from raising this meritorious argument.

2011,Knox v. Service Employees International Union,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","If the special assessment requires a different kind of notice, and possibly a different kind of opt-in or opt-out regime, would the case be moot? Well, we're not dealing here with the kind of notice -- with the typical Hudson notice given at the beginning of the year, when the annual dues are collected. We're dealing with a special assessment. Now, if a different kind of notice is constitutionally required in that context, would this case be moot? My question is whether the -- the different requirements, which presumably were not met here in the context of the special assessment, if there are different requirements in that context, would that be enough to preserve this case as a live controversy? What is this local, and what will the other locals do in the future when special assessments are made? Will they provide notice or will they go back to the old system? Is it incorrect that this was for what was termed a ""Political Fight-Back Fund""? Well, let me give you this example and maybe you will say that this is different from your case and the rules should be different in these two cases. The annual dues for a particular -- for members of this union are 1 percent of their salaries and let's say that amounts to -- or it's a certain percentage of their salaries, and let's say that amounts to $500 annual dues. And let's say that in the prior year 90 percent of the money collected by the union was used for chargeable purposes, 10 percent for non-chargeable purposes. So someone who objected, a nonmember who objected, would be able to get back $50. Now, during the course of the year the union levies a special assessment or whatever you want to call it, and for this 90 -- the percentages are exactly reversed. 90 percent is for non-chargeable, 10 percent is for chargeable. So now a member who potentially wants to object has $450 at stake. Now, in that situation, why shouldn't there be separate notice? Aren't the economic incentives quite different? Well, as I said, my hypothetical may be very different from what happened here, and maybe it's an unrealistic hypothetical and you can answer that. But if it were to occur, should there not be Hudson notice? But what if the money is going to be used for an election campaign? What if it is going to be used to weigh in, in favor of one gubernatorial candidate against another, in favor of one slate of legislative candidates against another. And on those issues, the nonmembers may have very strong partisan and ideological objections.

That I understand. But beyond that I really don't understand the difference between the two positions. Well, let me -- let me read you two sentences and tell me whether you think there is a difference between them. First one: ""Is there a fair possibility that this particular evidence caused the jury to convict? "" Second statement: ""Is there a fair possibility that this jury would have -- this jury would have convicted without the evidence? "" Do you see a difference between those two? What is the difference? Look. If you win your client will get a new trial. Let's suppose that the new trial is exactly like the trial that took place. Every single thing is the same except the error is corrected. All right. Isn't that essentially the harmless-error analysis? No? Well, maybe the majority in the court of appeals was wrong in its application of the harmless-error test. I don't think that's the reason why we took this, why we took this case. What I'm concerned about is the test. Now, the only aspect of -- the only thing that I understand that really differentiates your position from the government with respect to the test is whether the focus is on a rational jury or on this particular jury. And when you say the focus should be on this particular jury, aren't you calling for a speculation by the -- by an appellate court? How is an appellate court supposed to tell whether this particular jury was different from a hypothetical rational jury? Mr. Yang, you may be taking a harder position than you really need to. Why shouldn't the rule be that the -- the appellate court should look at what would be done by a rational jury, except in the kind of extraordinary circumstances that have been posited by Justice Kagan's hypothetical and a few of the other questions, simply because it's so difficult to determine what a -- what the jury was actually doing. We have a rule that prohibits consideration of what goes on in the jury room. But suppose we didn't have that. Suppose that it was all videotaped, and the jury didn't know what was going on, so you could -- you could watch it and see. If that were the case, then surely the rule would be what would this jury have done? But most of the time, it's just speculation to tell what a jury -- what they did -- did they come back quickly? Well, that shows that this evidence was so bad that it caused them to render a quick verdict in what otherwise would have been a difficult case. Did they take a long time? Well, it shows it was a close case, and therefore, any error might have tipped them one way or the other. You just can't tell. Did the panel majority in -- did the panel majority in this case say anything that differs from what this Court has said about harmless error? If -- if we were to reverse, what would we point to in the panel majority's opinion that was erroneous? Hasn't -- hasn't this Court said exactly what Seventh Circuit said there? In other cases? You want us to say -- you want us to say we're reversing you, Seventh Circuit panel, because you said what we have said in prior cases, but we were wrong?

Is there jurisdiction to consider 2 through 10? Well, in that situation then, if the State moves to dismiss the arguments that are made by Petitioner on issues 2 through 10, would the -- would the panel be obligated to do that?

",suppose the petitioner ask for a certificate of appealability on issue and the circuit judge say I be grant it on issue I be deny it on issue through through be there jurisdiction to consider through well in that situation then if the state move to dismiss the argument that be make by petitioner on issue through would the would the panel be obligate to do that it could do that without issue a new without issue a certificate of appealability without say we think that the judge who issue the certificate of appealability be incorrect that jurist of reason could disagree on issue through but be it necessary for you to go be it necessary for you to go as far as you seem to be go would it be possible to read c as mandatory but not jurisdictional so if well i understand what you just your argument to be that it do not even have any effect that so long as there be any document that be call the certificate of appealability then anything can be consider by the court of appeal panel without the issuance of a of a certificate of appealability cover the issue but if it be mandatory but not jurisdictional then if the state move or maybe if the court if the panel sue sponte identify the fact that there may be an error there be an opportunity for a new certificate of appealability if nothing be do then then there be not a problem it be not a jurisdictional issue that linger forever so if the panel look at the merit of constitutional issue as to which there be a reference in the certificate of appealability when it when it write its opinion it first have to ask itself be there a substantial showing and if there be not then it will say we will dismiss this claim and then but if it say well there be a substantial showing but it be wrong then we will affirm be that be that right you be say percent of the of the defendant who take an appeal through the texas system do not file a petition with the texas court of criminal appeal or be it percent of those who do not do that and then file a federal habeas petition i would imagine it be the former right yes ,132.40999999999997,Roberts Court,"Nov 2, 2011",Rafael Arriaza Gonzalez,"Rick Thaler, Director, Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Correctional Institutions Division",10-895,"Jun 13, 2011","Jan 10, 2012",112,0.0,1.0,0.0,0

2011,Setser v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","In situations like this, somebody is going to have to make the decision whether the Federal sentence and the subsequently imposed State sentence run concurrently or consecutively. And now you're arguing that that should be done by the Bureau of Prisons. Do you think in general that is better for defendants than a rule that would allow the sentencing judge in Federal court to make that determination? Why would the -- why would the exact length of the sentence imposed by the State court be relevant to the determination made by the sentencing judge? I thought the sentencing judge's reasoning was that the -- the undischarged term of imprisonment that was going to be imposed on the offense for which probation had previously been granted and there had been a violation of the probation, that that had nothing to do with his subsequent Federal drug charges, and therefore the Federal drug charges should run consecutively to that, but should be concurrent to any sentence imposed by the State court on the State drug charges. What -- you know, what's wrong with that reasoning, and what additional insight relevant to that reasoning would be obtained by waiting until after the sentence was imposed? Well, that's interesting. Do you think that the Bureau of Prisons is bound by those factors when they make the decision later? It seems to me that the question of how long someone should spend in prison, which is what's involved in determining whether -- deciding whether a sentence is going to be served consecutively or concurrently, is very different from determining where the sentence is going to be -- where a sentence is going to be served. Isn't this a very strange reading of -- of 3621, to say that that grants the BOP the authority to make this concurrent/consecutive determination? This is perhaps something that I should have asked the Solicitor General, but do you have any idea how often this situation comes up? In order for you to prevail, I think we -- is it correct, we would have to determine that there was this authority inherent in the judiciary prior to the enactment of this statute? Yes, with respect to Federal sentences, certainly that is true. But with respect to Federal and State sentences it may be, as you suggested it, this just did not come up very often until the enactment probably of the Federal drug laws and -- and a few other statutes that created offenses where you have -- where the same conduct would constitute a violation of both Federal and State law, and so you have this situation coming up with greater frequency. ",in situation like this somebody be go to have to make the decision whether the federal sentence and the subsequently impose state sentence run concurrently or consecutively and now you be argue that that should be do by the bureau of prison do you think in general that be good for defendant than a rule that would allow the sentence judge in federal court to make that determination why would the why would the exact length of the sentence impose by the state court be relevant to the determination make by the sentence judge i think the sentence judge s reasoning be that the the undischarged term of imprisonment that be go to be impose on the offense for which probation have previously be grant and there have be a violation of the probation that that have nothing to do with his subsequent federal drug charge and therefore the federal drug charge should run consecutively to that but should be concurrent to any sentence impose by the state court on the state drug charge what you know what be wrong with that reasoning and what additional insight relevant to that reason would be obtain by wait until after the sentence be impose well that be interesting do you think that the bureau of prison be bind by those factor when they make the decision later it seem to me that the question of how long someone should spend in prison which be what be involve in determine whether decide whether a sentence be go to be serve consecutively or concurrently be very different from determine where the sentence be go to be where a sentence be go to be serve be not this a very strange reading of of to say that that grant the bop the authority to make this concurrentconsecutive determination this be perhaps something that i should have ask the solicitor general but do you have any idea how often this situation come up in order for you to prevail i think we be it correct we would have to determine that there be this authority inherent in the judiciary prior to the enactment of this statute yes with respect to federal sentence certainly that be true but with respect to federal and state sentence it may be as you suggest it this just do not come up very often until the enactment probably of the federal drug law and and a few other statute that create offense where you have where the same conduct would constitute a violation of both federal and state law and so you have this situation come up with great frequency ,153.54,Roberts Court,"Nov 30, 2011",Monroe Ace Setser,United States,10-7387,"Jun 13, 2011","Mar 28, 2012",112,0.0,1.0,1.0,0
2011,Wood v. Milyard,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","It sounds like what you're arguing is that the court of appeals abused its discretion in viewing this as a plain forfeiture, which you've just said would permit the court of appeals to raise the issue sua sponte, instead of a deliberate waiver. Is that what it comes down to. They put it in the wrong -- they abused their discretion by putting it in the wrong box. They didn't put it in the forfeiture box; they put it in the deliberate waiver box. This is what -- this is what troubles me about your argument that the court of appeals abused its discretion. Is it correct that you did not raise the issue of the court of appeals' lack of authority to raise this sua sponte until rehearing? But you're arguing that the court of appeals abused its discretion by failing to rule in your favor on an argument that you didn't make? What Rule of Civil Procedure applies here? You're talking about appellate procedure here. Is there a rule of appellate procedure that governs this? Well, they refer to what happens in the district court, and Day dealt with that. Now you're in the court of appeals. What rule is there that addresses the situation in the court of appeals? You made an argument in your brief that I found it a little difficult to follow, so maybe you can explain it. You seemed to suggest that the State's position on timeliness in district court somehow induced your client to dismiss the claims that were arguably not exhausted. And I found it difficult to understand why the -- why your client's strategy as to whether he wanted to dismiss those claims are not -- would be affected by the State's position on timeliness. That's what I don't understand. Why -- you have two situations. One situation, the State's raising timeliness. So he says: Okay, they're raising timeliness; I'm not going to dismiss my -- the claims that they say are not exhausted. The other situation, they -- they don't say anything about timeliness, and he says: Now I'm going to dismiss the claims that are -- that they say are unexhausted. I don't understand the connection. I understand why that's a benefit to him. But what is the connection between that and the dismissal of the unexhausted claims? Isn't the screening function that the -- the district court performs in the habeas case inconsistent with the traditional rule about raising affirmative defenses? Well, let me give you this example of a regular civil case. There are two defendants and the same claim against two defendants. One defendant files an answer and raises a statute of limitations defense, the other one doesn't. The judge asks the second defendant, are you going to amend your complaint, and the defendant says no. Now is that a waiver or is that a forfeiture? Under the terminology we are using wouldn't that be a forfeiture? Well, why do you say that the position that the State took in the district court permitted the district court from considering the time limits issue? If it wasn't a deliberate waiver, then the district court under Day wasn't prohibited from deciding the case untimely. Well, I may have forgotten the procedural complications of this case, but here, did the State have any opportunity before the court of appeals to raise the timeliness issue prior to the time when the court of appeals issued its certificate of appealability? And if the court of appeals had not issued a certificate of appealability on the issue of timeliness, would the issue have come up at all? If a State knows that it has a potential statute of limitations defense and says nothing, is that a forfeiture or a waiver? So simply saying nothing can be a waiver, in your view. If the answer to that is not, then what is the difference between saying nothing, knowing that you have a defense and saying we're not challenging but we're not conceding? What is the difference? Let me just ask it one more way and then I'll-- --Back in the office, they're considering -- in the State's office, they're considering what they're going to do. And they say well, what we're going to do is we're not going to challenge it, but we're not going to concede it. And therefore, they say nothing. ",it sound like what you be argue be that the court of appeal abuse its discretion in view this as a plain forfeiture which you have just say would permit the court of appeal to raise the issue sua sponte instead of a deliberate waiver be that what it come down to they put it in the wrong they abuse their discretion by put it in the wrong box they do not put it in the forfeiture box they put it in the deliberate waiver box this be what this be what troubles me about your argument that the court of appeal abuse its discretion be it correct that you do not raise the issue of the court of appeal lack of authority to raise this sua sponte until rehear but you be argue that the court of appeal abuse its discretion by fail to rule in your favor on an argument that you do not make what rule of civil procedure applies here you be talk about appellate procedure here be there a rule of appellate procedure that govern this well they refer to what happen in the district court and day dealt with that now you be in the court of appeal what rule be there that address the situation in the court of appeal you make an argument in your brief that i find it a little difficult to follow so maybe you can explain it you seem to suggest that the state s position on timeliness in district court somehow induce your client to dismiss the claim that we be arguably not exhaust and i find it difficult to understand why the why your client s strategy as to whether he want to dismiss those claim be not would be affect by the state s position on timeliness that be what i do not understand why you have two situation one situation the state s raise timeliness so he say okay they be raise timeliness I be not go to dismiss my the claim that they say be not exhaust the other situation they they do not say anything about timeliness and he say now I be go to dismiss the claim that be that they say be unexhausted i do not understand the connection i understand why that be a benefit to him but what be the connection between that and the dismissal of the unexhausted claim be not the screening function that the the district court performs in the habeas case inconsistent with the traditional rule about raise affirmative defense well let me give you this example of a regular civil case there be two defendant and the same claim against two defendant one defendant file an answer and raise a statute of limitation defense the other one do not the judge ask the second defendant be you go to amend your complaint and the defendant say no now be that a waiver or be that a forfeiture under the terminology we be use would not that be a forfeiture well why do you say that the position that the state take in the district court permit the district court from consider the time limit issue if it be not a deliberate waiver then the district court under day be not prohibit from decide the case untimely well i may have forget the procedural complication of this case but here do the state have any opportunity before the court of appeal to raise the timeliness issue prior to the time when the court of appeal issue its certificate of appealability and if the court of appeal have not issue a certificate of appealability on the issue of timeliness would the issue have come up at all if a state know that it have a potential statute of limitation defense and say nothing be that a forfeiture or a waiver so simply say nothing can be a waiver in your view if the answer to that be not then what be the difference between say nothing know that you have a defense and say we be not challenge but we be not concede what be the difference let me just ask it one more way and then I will back in the office they be consider in the state s office they be consider what they be go to do and they say well what we be go to do be we be not go to challenge it but we be not go to concede it and therefore they say nothing ,244.92,Roberts Court,"Feb 27, 2012",Patrick Wood,"Kevin Milyard, Warden, Sterling Correctional Facility, et al.",10-9995,"Sep 27, 2011","Apr 24, 2012",112,1.0,1.0,1.0,1
2011,National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, Congress said that many times, but is there any case in which the result would have been different if the Anti-Injunction Act were not viewed as jurisdictional but instead were viewed as a mandatory claims processing -- rule? Well, the clearest -- the clearest way of distinguishing between the jurisdictional provision and a mandatory claims processing rule is whether it can be waived and whether the Court feels that it has an obligation to raise the issue Sua Sponte. Now, if there are a lot of cases that call it jurisdictional, but none of them would have come out differently if the Anti-Injunction Act were simply a mandatory claims processing rule, you have that on one side. And on the other side, you have Davis, where the Court accepted a waiver by the Solicitor General; the Sunshine Anthracite coal case, where there also was a waiver; and, there's the Williams Packing case, which is somewhat hard to understand as viewing the Anti-Injunction Act as a jurisdictional provision. The Court said that there could be a suit if -- there is no way the government could win, and the Plaintiff would suffer irreparable harm. Now, doesn't that sound like an equitable exception to the Anti-Injunction Act? Why is that? Well, they say they want to obey the law, and they say that your argument puts them in the position of having to disobey the law in order to obtain review of their claim. And what is your answer to that? Well, let me take us back to Justice Kennedy's question about the ""for the purpose of"" language. I take it you interpret the statute to mean the following: ""For the purpose of"" means having the effect of. Is that correct? General Verrilli, today you are arguing that the penalty is not a tax. Tomorrow you are going to be back and you will be arguing that the penalty is a tax. Has the Court ever held that something that is a tax for purposes of the taxing power under the Constitution is not a tax under the Anti-Injunction Act? Sub-section A says directly, ""an applicable individual shall ensure that the individual has the minimum essential coverage. "" And you are saying it doesn't really mean that, that if you're not subject to the penalty, you're not under the obligation to maintain the minimum essential coverage? I'm sorry, go ahead. Suppose a person who has been receiving medical care in an emergency room -- has no health insurance but, over the years, goes to the emergency room when the person wants medical care -- goes to the emergency room, and the hospital says, well, fine, you are eligible for Medicaid, enroll in Medicaid. And the person says, no, I don't want that. I want to continue to get -- just get care here from the emergency room. Will the hospital be able to point to the mandate and say, well, you're obligated to enroll? No, they are not facing the tax penalty. So the hospital will have to continue to give them care and pay for it themselves, and not require them to be enrolled in Medicaid. Will they be able to take this out and say, well, you really should -- you have a moral obligation to do it; the Congress of the United States has said, you have to enroll? No, they can't say? After this takes effect, there may be a lot of people who are assessed the penalty and disagree either with whether they should be assessed the penalty at all, or with the calculation of the amount of their penalty. So under your interpretation of the Act, all of them can now go to court? None of them are barred by the Anti-Injunction Act? I think for reasons that Justice Kennedy, I think, suggested in one of his questions to Mr. Long, all of the other doctrines that are an exhaustion of remedies and related doctrines would still be there. The United States would rely on them in those circumstances. And -- and so, I don't think the answer is that they can all go to court, no. Two former -- two former commissioners of the IRS have filed a brief saying that your interpretation is going to lead to a flood of litigation. Are they wrong on that? Do you think there is a, a market for burial services? Yes. All right, suppose that you and I walked around downtown Washington at lunch hour and we found a couple of healthy young people and we stopped them and we said, ""You know what you're doing? "" ""You are financing your burial services right now because eventually you're going to die, and somebody is going to have to pay for it, and if you don't have burial insurance and you haven't saved money for it, you're going to shift the cost to somebody else. "" Isn't that a very artificial way of talking about what somebody is doing? And if that's true, why isn't it equally artificial to say that somebody who is doing absolutely nothing about health care is financing health care services? I don't see the difference. You can get burial insurance. You can get health insurance. Most people are going to need health care. Almost everybody. Everybody is going to be buried or cremated at some point. What's the difference? Here-- --Sure you do, because if you don't have money then the State is going to pay for it. Or some -- to pay. Or a family member is going-- --But isn't that a very small part of what the mandate is doing? You can correct me if these figures are wrong, but it appears to me that the CBO has estimated that the average premium for a single insurance policy in the non-group market would be roughly $5,800 in -- in 2016. Respondents -- the economists have supported -- the Respondents estimate that a young, healthy individual targeted by the mandate on average consumes about $854 in health services each year. So the mandate is forcing these people to provide a huge subsidy to the insurance companies for other purposes that the act wishes to serve, but isn't -- if those figures are right, isn't it the case that what this mandate is really doing is not requiring the people who are subject to it to pay for the services that they are going to consume? It is requiring them to subsidize services that will be received by somebody else. Are you denying this? If you took the group of people who are subject to the mandate and you calculated the amount of health care services this whole group would consume and figured out the cost of an insurance policy to cover the services that group would consume, the cost of that policy would be much, much less than the kind of policy that these people are now going to be required to purchase under the Affordable Care Act? The point is -- no, you take into account that some people in that group are going to be hit by a bus, some people in that group are going to unexpectedly contract or be diagnosed with a disease that -- that is very expensive to treat. But if you take their costs and you calculate that, that's a lot less than the amount that they are going to be required to pay. So that you can't just justify this on the basis of their trying to shift their costs off to other people, can you? Could you just -- before you move on, could you express your limiting principle as succinctly as you possibly can? Congress can force people to purchase a product where the failure to purchase the product has a substantial effect on interstate commerce -- if what? If this is part of a larger regulatory scheme? Was that it? Was there anything more? Can the -- can the mandate be viewed as tax if it does impose a requirement on people who are not subject to the penalty or the tax? Mr. Carvin, isn't there this difference between Justice Breyer's hypothetical and the law that we have before us here? In his hypothetical harm to other people from the communicable disease is the result of the disease. It is not the result of something that the government has done, whereas here the reason why there is cost shifting is because the government has mandated that. It has required hospitals to provide emergency treatment, and instead of paying for that through a tax which would be born by everybody, it has required -- it has set up a system in which the cost is surreptitiously shifted to people who have health insurance and who pay their bills when they go to the hospital. Do you think they are drawing a line between commerce and everything else that is not commerce is drawing an artificial line, drawing a line between Congress and manufacturing? Well, can I ask you this, Mr. Clement? What would your fallback position be if -- if we don't accept the proposition that if the mandate is declared unconstitutional, the rest of the Act, every single provision, has to fall? Other -- proposed other dispositions have been proposed. There's the Solicitor General's disposition, the recommended disposition to strike down the guaranteed-issue and community rating provisions. One of the -- one amicus says strike down all of Title I, another one says strike down all of Title I and Title II. What -- what would you suggest? Suppose that there was -- suppose there was a non-severability provision in -- in this Act. If one provision were to be held unconstitutional, then every single -- someone would have to bring a -- a separate lawsuit challenging every single other provision in the Act and say, well, one fell and the Congress said it's all -- it's a package, it can't be separated. That's your position? May I ask you about the argument that is made in the economists' amicus brief? They say that the insurance reforms impose 10-year costs of roughly $700 billion on the insurance industry, and that these costs are supposed to be offset by about 350 billion in new revenue from the individual mandate and 350 billion from the Medicaid expansion. Now if the 350 billion -- maybe you will disagree with the numbers, that they are fundamentally wrong; but assuming they are in the ballpark, if the 350 million from the individual mandate were to be lost, what would happen to the insurance industry, which would now be in the -- in the hole for $350 billion over 10 years? Well, if that is true, what is the difference between guaranteed-issue and community-rating provisions on the one hand and other provisions that increase costs substantially for insurance companies? For example, the tax on high cost health plans, which the economists in the amicus brief said would cost $217 billion over 10 years? Let me give you a factual context. Let's say Congress says this to the States: We have got great news for you; we know your expenditures on education are a huge financial burden, so we are going to take that completely off your shoulders; we are going to impose a special Federal education tax which will raise exactly the same amount of money as all of the States now spend on education; and then we are going to give you a grant that is equal to what you spent on education last year. Now, this is a great offer and we think you will take it, but of course, if you take it, it's going to have some conditions because we are going to set rules on teacher tenure, on collective bargaining, on curriculum, on textbooks, class size, school calendar and many other things. So take it or leave it. If you take it, you have to follow our rules on all of these things. If you leave it, well, then you are going to have to fine -- you are going to have to tax your citizens, they are going to have to pay the Federal education tax; but on top of that, you were going to have to tax them for all of the money that you are now spending on education. Plus all of the Federal funds that you were previously given. Would that be -- would that reach the point -- would that be the point where financial inducement turns into coercion? No. You might be right. But if that is the case then there is nothing left. 27198812723016 --of federalism. Is this discussion realistic? The objective of the Affordable Care Act is to provide near universal health care. Now suppose that all of the 26 States that are parties to this case were to say, well, we're not going to -- we're not going to abide by the new conditions. Then there would be a huge portion -- a big portion of the population that would not have healthcare, and it's a realistic possibility the Secretary is going to say, well, okay, fine, you know. We are going to cut off your new funds but we are not going to cut off your old funds and just let that condition sit there. Well, I'm not -- in selling this argument -- take the poorest of the poor. If there is no Medicaid program, then they're not going to get health care. Isn't that right? So Congress obviously assumed -- it thought it was inconceivable that any State would reject this offer, because the objective of the Affordable Care Act is to provide near-universal care. And Medicaid is the way to provide care for at least the poorest of the poor. So it -- it just didn't occur to them that this was a possibility. And when -- when that's the case, how can that not be coercion? Unless it's just a gift. Unless it's just purely a gift. Then it comes back to the question of whether you think it makes a difference that the money -- a lot of the money to pay for this -- is going to come out of the same taxpayers that the States have to tax to get their money. ",well congress say that many time but be there any case in which the result would have be different if the anti injunction act we be not view as jurisdictional but instead we be view as a mandatory claim process rule well the clear the clear way of distinguish between the jurisdictional provision and a mandatory claim process rule be whether it can be waive and whether the court feel that it

disease be the result of the disease it be not the result of something that the government have do whereas here the reason why there be cost shifting be because the government have mandate that it have require hospital to provide emergency treatment and instead of pay for that through a tax which would be bear by everybody it have require it have set up a system in which the cost be surreptitiously shift to people who have health insurance and who pay their bill when they go to the hospital do you think they be draw a line between commerce and everything else that be not commerce be draw an artificial line draw a line between congress and manufacturing well can i ask you this mr clement what would your fallback position be if if we do not accept the proposition that if the mandate be declare unconstitutional the rest of the act every single provision have to fall other propose other disposition have be propose there be the solicitor general s disposition the recommended disposition to strike down the guaranteed issue and community rating provision one of the one amicus say strike down all of title i another one say strike down all of title i and title ii what what would you suggest suppose that there be suppose there be a non severability provision in in this act if one provision we be to be hold unconstitutional then every single someone would have to bring a a separate lawsuit challenge every single other provision in the act and say well one fell and the congress say it be all it be a package it can not be separate that be your position may i ask you about the argument that be make in the economist amicus brief they say that the insurance reform impose year cost of roughly billion on the insurance industry and that these cost be suppose to be offset by about billion in new revenue from the individual mandate and billion from the medicaid expansion now if the billion maybe you will disagree with the number that they be fundamentally wrong but assume they be in the ballpark if the million from the individual mandate we be to be lose what would happen to the insurance industry which would now be in the in the hole for billion over year well if that be true what be the difference between guarantee issue and community rating provision on the one hand and other provision that increase cost substantially for insurance company for example the tax on high cost health plan which the economist in the amicus brief say would cost billion over year let me give you a factual context let us say congress say this to the state we have get great news for you we know your expenditure on education be a huge financial burden so we be go to take that completely off your shoulder we be go to impose a special federal education tax which will raise exactly the same amount of money as all of the state now spend on education and then we be go to give you a grant that be equal to what you spend on education last year now this be a great offer and we think you will take it but of course if you take it it be go to have some condition because we be go to set rule on teacher tenure on collective bargaining on curriculum on textbook class size school calendar and many other thing so take it or leave it if you take it you have to follow our rule on all of these thing if you leave it well then you be go to have to fine you be go to have to tax your citizen they be go to have to pay the federal education tax but on top of that you we be go to have to tax them for all of the money that you be now spend on education plus all of the federal fund that you we be previously give would that be would that reach the point would that be the point where financial inducement turn into coercion no you might be right but if that be the case then there be nothing left of federalism be this discussion realistic the objective of the affordable care act be to provide near universal health care now suppose that all of the state that be party to this case we be to say well we be not go to we be not go to abide by the new condition then there would be a huge portion a big portion of the population that would not have healthcare and it be a realistic possibility the secretary be go to say well okay fine you know we be go to cut off your new fund but we be not go to cut off your old fund and just let that condition sit there well I be not in sell this argument take the poor of the poor if there be no medicaid program then they be not go to get health care be not that right so congress obviously assume it think it be inconceivable that any state would reject this offer because the objective of the affordable care act be to provide near universal care and medicaid be the way to provide care for at least the poor of the poor so it it just do not occur to them that this be a possibility and when when that be the case how can that not be coercion unless it be just a gift unless it be just purely a gift then it come back to the question of whether you think it make a difference that the money a lot of the money to pay for this be go to come out of the same taxpayer that the state have to tax to get their money

Would you not provide that the -- would you not require the Sentencing Commission to act as quickly as possible to get the new sentencing guidelines out? No? You would say take your time and it doesn't matter if a few -- a few defendants who are -- who commit the offense after the enactment of the Fair Sentencing Act come up and they are -- they're subjected to the old soon-to-be-obsolete sentencing guidelines? Could I ask you this about your argument? Because I do think the one you're stressing now is a -- is a good argument and your best one. But what troubles me is that an earlier bill, H.R. 265, which contained the provision that says ""There shall be no retroactive application of any portion of this Act. "" contains the very language that you're stressing now. So how do you reconcile that? No, I understand that. But wouldn't you want -- the problem that you're -- maybe -- I understand your argument to be that the language you're stressing now will mean, if this applies only to post-enactment offenders, that there will be defendants who will be sentenced to -- under the -- under old -- under the old mandatory minimums but the new guidelines. Would that not occur under the -- clearly occur under H.R. 265? Well, along those lines, could I -- could I ask you this question, which is intended to explore the -- the issue whether the argument about bringing the guidelines into consistency with applicable law doesn't assume the -- the answer that is -- that one attempts to get from it. Suppose the -- the -- the Fair Sentencing Act said expressly, this applies only -- the new mandatory minimums apply only to post-Act offenders, but it also contained a provision that says the Sentencing Commission has to bring the guidelines into consistency with applicable law. I assume there what they would have to do would be to say that the new guidelines apply only to post-enactment offenders, so that the Fair Sentencing Act would trump this previous provision in the Sentencing Reform Act. Wouldn't that be correct?

2011,Elgin v. Department of the Treasury,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Why would you make that concession? Why wouldn't it be possible in that, for an employee to choose? If the employee had both constitutional and nonconstitutional claims, perhaps that employee could take advantage of the review scheme that's outlined by the government. But in the situation where there's purely a challenge to a statute, the employee would have the option of bringing the claim in one of the district courts. There are at least -- at least three different kind of constitutional claims and I'm not sure where you're drawing the line with respect to your argument. There is a claim that -- that the agency acted in an unconstitutional manner, not that any statute is unconstitutional-- --but there is unconstitutional executive action. There is an as applied claim. Let's say that the plaintiff says that the registration requirement is unconstitutional as applied to me, not to other people, but to me because I'm a conscientious objector or I have religious objections to military action that the United States is taking at this particular time and then there is -- there is a claim that the statute is unconstitutional in space. Where do you -- which of those can the Merit Systems Protection Review Board decide, just the first category? So it's not a distinction between as-applied and facial. How can it -- how can it deal with discovery without knowing -- without going into the merits of the constitutional claim? In other words, the parties can just put in any evidence they any evidence they want? Any evidence they think might be possibly be relevant to the case, they can put that in. It can be discovery of anything. They are not the same claim. They are related, but one says the statute means something; and insofar as it's applied to a particular situation, it's unconstitutional. The other one says it doesn't mean that. When we just wanted to rephrase that -- If this Court adopts a certain interpretation based on principle of constitutional avoidance, do you think the Court is rewriting the statute? Congress -- Congress is unhappy when this Court holds a statute unconstitutional. [Laughter] Do you think it's really likely that they intended for the MS -- the MSPB to have the authority to declare its acts unconstitutional? If somebody who drafted or voted for the Civil Service Reform Act had thought about a case like this, where it's a pure question of law, a facial challenge to constitutionality of a statute, do you think they would have said well, the way we think that this should be handled is this scheme that you have proposed? I suspect that if this were litigated in district court, the government would move to dismiss and would take the position that it doesn't matter; even if women can now do 99 percent of the -- the things that are done in the military, the -- the Registration Act is still constitutional. Wouldn't you take that position? Would you say that if -- if it can be proven that they have -- that women are now, that the percentage is now high enough, the statute may be unconstitutional? Anyway, assuming that you might take that position, then -- and you might win on that -- then what would be the point of having all of this discovery that you're talking about? All of this -- all of this development of the factual record? What -- what sense does it make to develop a big factual record before you know whether it's even -- whether it even makes any difference?

2011,FAA v. Cooper,112,"Samuel A.

But you allege that -- that Mr. Cooper suffered a severe emotional distress when he was confronted with the fact that his records had been turned over. So you're -- you're saying that the court -- that on remand, there would have to be a separation of the degree of distress that he suffered as a result of simply knowing that somebody in the FAA had access to his Social Security records, but disregard the distress that somebody in that situation would naturally feel when confronted with the fact that a criminal violation that he had committed had been exposed? But you agree that the act does not allow recovery for what would have been regarded at common law as general damages? ""General damages"", that's the term that they peeled off, right? But general damages is a term from -- from the remedies in defamation cases, right? And there are two types of damages in defamation cases, special damages and general damages and if you -- is that correct? And you subtract general damages and what do you have left? But the problem is that -- that your definition of actual damages and the general definition of actual damages includes some things that fell within the rubric of general damages. Let me just try this one more time. You -- you say that there is a right to recover actual damages but no right to recover general damages. So what you think is recoverable is actual damages minus general damages? Well, suppose this were a common lawsuit for slander per quod, and what was said was that Mr. Cooper received Social Security disability benefits. Now, he would -- and he claims that causes him great distress because of the extrinsic fact that he was known to be a pilot, and therefore, people who -- who knew that he was flying around an airplane even though he was so severely disabled that he was entitled to get Social Security disability benefits, that would damage his reputation. Now, the damages that you're seeking, the emotional distress that he allegedly incurred, what would that be? Which -- under what category of damages would that fall? Then let's-- --You don't claim any economic loss there. No. Under the -- would that be the term that a court -- a common law court would use: actual damages? Wouldn't they ask whether the damages to his reputation and the emotional distress that he suffered therefrom were either -- wouldn't they ask whether that was special or general? No. Gertz came after the common law. Gertz was a modification of the common law. What would it be at common law? General damages here are excluded by Congress, right?

2011,Maples v. Thomas,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Where do we look -- where do we look to see that it's standard practice for local counsel throughout the country to contact out-of-State counsel when something like this is received? I remember a case from the Federal system in which local counsel appeared and did exactly what was done here, moved the admission of an out-of-State criminal defense attorney, who then tried the case for a year, got sick, and the judge said to the local counsel: Come on in; you are going to take over this trial and try it for the next 6 months. And the local counsel said: Whoa, I only signed up to move the admission of this fellow. The judge said: That's too bad; you are counsel of record and you have to take over the case. I don't understand that what is alleged to have occurred here is that far out of the ordinary. Putting aside the question of local counsel, could we find that there was an abandonment if the law firm of Sullivan and Cromwell continued to represent Mr. Maples after the two young attorneys left the firm? And does the record show that they did not represent Mr. Maples, that this was done purely by the two attorneys? Is there a finding by a court on that? You concede from these questions that the arguments that you are making in this capital case, which is sui generis, are pushing the Court to consider rules that would have far-reaching effect, such as a rule that places upon a clerk of the court a constitutional obligation to serve counsel with important documents in the case similar to the constitutional obligation to serve initial process in the case. And the question that I would like to ask is whether this -- the -- whether you as the Solicitor General or the Attorney General of Alabama have an obligation to push this matter in this way. This is a case where, as I said, it's a capital case, as we all recognize. Mr. Maples has lost his right to appeal through no fault of his own, through a series of very unusual and unfortunate circumstances. Now, when his attorneys moved to file an out-of-time appeal, why wouldn't you just consent to that? If he did not receive an effective assistance of counsel at trial, why not give a decision on the merits of that? Why push this technical argument? There is no possibility under Alabama rules for an out-of-time appeal in this circumstance? No extension? Is that a discretionary matter or is that a flat rule, once you passed a certain time deadline, you are out of luck. There is no opportunity where there's good cause for an extension? What is troubling to me about the abandonment argument is that -- is the fear that if the Court says that abandonment is cause, there will be many, many cases in which the allegation is my attorney wasn't just ineffective and negligent, the attorney was so bad that the attorney in effect abandoned me. And that will substantially change existing law. Now how can that be prevented?

Has there ever been an instance in which the President has recognized a foreign government over Congress's sustained objection? Well, doesn't it depend on what the question is. In order to decide whether it's a political question, you have to identify the question. Now, if the question is whether the President has exclusive authority with respect to the formal recognition of a foreign country that might be one thing.

2011,Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. EEOC,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Mr. Laycock, the ministerial exception is not something new. It has been widely recognized, as Justice Sotomayor mentioned, by the courts of appeals going back 40 years. So we can see how the recognition of this exception within -- with certain contours, has worked out, and how has it worked out over those past 40 years? Have there been a great many cases, a significant number of cases, involving the kinds of things that Justice Sotomayor is certainly rightly concerned about, instances in which ministers have been fired for reporting criminal violations and that sort of thing? But I thought with a lot of deference to the church's understanding of whether someone is a minister. Mr. Laycock, didn't this inquiry illustrate the problems that will necessarily occur if you get into a pretext analysis -- the question of was she told that she had violated the church's teaching about suing in a civil tribunal. Well, that depends. The significance of -- let's assume she wasn't told. The significance of that depends on how central a teaching of Lutheranism this is. It's like, suppose a Catholic priest got married and the bishop said: I'm removing you from your parish because of your conduct. Now, there wouldn't be much question about why that was done. So you'd have to get in -- what did Martin Luther actually say about, 2 about suing the church where other Christians in a civil tribunal. Is this really a central tenet of Lutheranism? Isn't that the problem with going into this pretext analysis. Well, do you accept the proposition that one of the central concerns of the Establishment Clause was preventing the government from choosing ministers? When there was an established church, the government chose the ministers or had a say in choosing the ministers. And the Establishment Clause many argue was centrally focused on eliminating that governmental power. Now, do you dispute that? When you say that, are you not implicitly making a judgment about the relative importance of the Catholic doctrine that only males can be ordained as priests and the Lutheran doctrine that a Lutheran should not sue the church in civil courts? I don't see any distinction between -- I can't reconcile your position on those two issues without coming to the conclusion that you think that the Catholic doctrine is older, stronger and entitled to more respect than the Lutheran doctrine. Well, if -- if the plaintiff proceeded that way, would she be entitled to -- I assume she would -- introduce testimony by experts on Lutheranism, theologians, professors of religion about how the -- about this -- this tenet, and it isn't really -- they might say, well, it's really not that strong and it once was, but it's faded, and it's not -- it's not widely enforced. And then you'd have experts on the other side, and you'd have a court and a lay jury deciding how important this really is to Lutherans. Is that how that would play out? How are we going to avoid that? I just don't see it. No. It's not just irrelevant. I've dozens and dozens and dozens of pretext cases, and in practically every pretext case that I've seen one of the central issues is whether the reason that was proffered by the employer is the real reason, is an important reason for that, for that employer, and whether they really think it's important and whether they apply it across the board. That's almost always a big part of the case. And once you get into that, you're going to get into questions of -- of religious doctrine. I just don't see it. Let me give you an example of a real case. A nun wanted to be -- wanted a tenured position teaching canon law at Catholic University and she claimed that she was denied tenure because of her -- because of her gender. Now, there the university might argue, no, she's -- and did argue -- she's denied tenure because of the quality of her, of her scholarship. And okay, now, if you just try that pretext issue, the issue is going to be what is the real quality of her canon law scholarship? And you're going to have the judge and the jury decide whether this particular writings on canon law are -- make a contribution to canon law scholarship. How can something like that be tried, without getting into religious issues? Let me just come back to the example of the canon law, Professor, because I still don't see how the -- the approach that the Solicitor General is recognizing is recommending could -- can eliminate the problems involved in pretext. So the -- the -- as I understood her -- her answer, it was that you couldn't look into the question of whether the professor's canon law scholarship was really good canon law scholarship, but you could try the issue of sex discrimination based on other evidence. So maybe there is some stray remarks here and there about a woman teaching canon law. Now, a response to that might be that wasn't the real reason -- and if you just look at the scholarship and you see how miserable it is and how inconsistent it is with church doctrine, you could see that that's the real reason for it. So you just cannot get away from evaluating religious issues. It's antedated. Did it not antedate the enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act? Then shouldn't we assume that Congress -- that Congress -- assumed that it would continue to apply to the ADA, just as it applied to Title VII. ",mr laycock the ministerial exception be not something new it have be widely recognize as justice sotomayor mention by the court of appeal go back year so we can see how the recognition of this

2011,Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of the County of Burlington,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, how would this work with respect to individuals who have been arrested for serious offenses? Let's say someone has been arrested for -- for assault. Say it's a case of domestic violence, assault. Would that be enough to justify a search? I understand. You say that you don't want to draw that line; you want to apply it to everybody. And I'm asking you whether the mere fact that someone has been arrested for a violent offense would in your judgment be sufficient to provide reasonable suspicion. I'm confused about your-- --your position. Suppose a jurisdiction has the policy of requiring every inmate who is arrested and is going to be held in custody to disrobe and take a shower and apply medication for the prevention of the spread of lice and is observed while this is taking place from some distance by a corrections officer, let's say 10 feet away. Is that -- does that require a reasonable suspicion? So your -- your only concern is searches that go further than that. Could I just follow up on that? Is there a dispute of fact as to whether anything beyond that occurred in Burlington County? Would you say that regardless of the offense for which the person is arrested? There have been some stories in the news recently about cities that have taken to arresting people for traffic citations. Suppose someone is just arrested because they have a lot of tickets for being caught on speed cameras, let's say. That person can be subjected to the searches that you are describing? Suppose we accept the Petitioner's concession that it is permissible to require everybody who is arrested to disrobe and shower under the observation of the corrections officer from a certain distance. Now the question would become: How many people who do that will still be able to smuggle in contraband? I don't think you are really arguing for an individualized reasonable suspicion standard. I think you are arguing for a rule that draws distinctions based on categories that correspond only perhaps very roughly to reasonable suspicion. ",well how would this work with respect to individual who have be arrest for serious offense let us say someone have be arrest for for assault say it be a case of domestic violence assault would that be enough to justify a search i understand you say that you do not want to draw that line you want to apply it to everybody and I be ask you whether the mere fact that someone have be arrest for a violent offense would in your judgment be sufficient to provide reasonable suspicion I be confuse about your your position suppose a jurisdiction have the policy of require every inmate who be arrest and be go to be hold in custody to disrobe and take a shower and apply medication for the prevention of the spread of louse and be observe while this be take place from some distance by a correction officer let us say foot away be that do that require a reasonable suspicion so your your only concern be search that go far than that could i just follow up on that be there a dispute of fact as to whether anything beyond that occur in burlington county would you say that regardless of the offense for which the person be arrest there have be some story in the news recently about city that have take to arrest people for traffic citation suppose someone be just arrest because they have a lot of ticket for be catch on speed camera let us say that person can be subject to the search that you be describe suppose we accept the petitioner s concession that it be permissible to require everybody who be arrest to disrobe and shower under the observation of the correction officer from a certain distance now the question would become how many people who do that will still be able to smuggle in contraband i do not think you be really argue for an individualized reasonable suspicion standard i think you be argue for a rule that draw distinction base on category that correspond only perhaps very roughly to reasonable suspicion ,140.25000000000003,Roberts Court,"Oct 12, 2011",Albert W.

2011,National Meat Association v. Harris,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","And what's that definition? So the Seventh Circuit and -- and I forget what the other circuit -- was were incorrect in saying that the -- that the State could prohibit the slaughter of horses? Doesn't it seem strange to hold that the Federal Meat Inspection Act speaks to an issue like that? This doesn't have anything -- whether or not horses should be slaughtered and sold and their meat should be sold doesn't have anything to do with food safety, does it? And it doesn't have anything to do with humane treatment, assuming the same methods of slaughter are used? No, I wasn't speaking of the California law. I was speaking of the law that prohibits the -- the slaughter of horses. That's based just on a judgment, a societal judgment that this is an animal that should not be slaughtered and sold for food. What does that have to do with any of the purposes of the Federal Meat Inspection Act? But -- isn't it the case that most nonambulatory animals become nonambulatory because of the method of transportation that's used? Do you dispute the statistics in the brief of the non-State Respondent that -- Respondents that -- nationwide, approximately 220,000 swine die during transport, another 440,000 become nonambulatory during the transportation process? Do you dispute the fact that the -- that ranchers generally do not ship animals that are nonambulatory at the time when the trip begins, but that most of these nonambulatory animals become nonambulatory during the transportation process? And you think it's difficult to identify which animals are nonambulatory? That's the difference between horses, that's -- between prohibiting the slaughter of horses, because you can tell whether it's a horse or a pig, but you can't tell whether a pig can walk? Well, if they do it at the weigh station the truck has to stop at when it enters the State, that would be okay? Well, before you get to that point, the animal has to be transported. Does Federal law regulate for humane purposes the transportation of animals to slaughterhouses? Well, if the Federal -- if Congress has not chosen to regulate the transportation of animals to prevent inhumane treatment in transit, why should a State law that aims at that objective be preempted? Well, if the State could inspect the trucks at a weigh station before they get to the slaughterhouse, why can't they do the same thing when they get to the slaughterhouse, where it's more practical to do that?

2011,Smith v. Cain,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, aren't you exaggerating a little bit about the value of the impeachment evidence regarding Boatner? My understanding is that he made his first statement to the effect that he couldn't identify anybody at the scene, when he had been at the scene where five people that he knew very well had been killed. He was lying on the floor with a big gash on his head. He was questioned at the scene, and at that time -- this was in the evening -- he said: I can't identify anybody. But then later that very day, wasn't it? That very evening, after midnight, he was questioned at the police station. Am I correct. And at that point he gave a description. He did make an -- he did provide a description of the person that he said was the one who first came through the door. So, you know, that -- I don't know -- and then later, he said he -- there were statements to the effect that he couldn't identify anybody. But in light of the fact that he did provide a pretty, you know, somewhat detailed description on the very evening of the event, doesn't that -- aren't you exaggerating when you say that he said numerous times -- the effect of these statements that he couldn't-- --That may be true, but if you were a juror and Boatner testified and he was cross-examined and they attempted to impeach him based on his failure to make an identification right at the scene and he said, well, that was because five of my friends had just been killed and I was lying on the floor and I thought I was going to be shot too and I had a big gash on my head, and then a couple of hours later when I collected myself and they asked me the same question at the police station I provided a description and didn't say I couldn't identify anybody, do you think jurors would just dismiss that and say, well, he couldn't identified him at the scene so he must have been lying when he identified -- when he provided a description later at the police station? Does the defense have any theory as to why Boatner would lie about whether he could identify this individual? Yes, but -- but the impact of your impeachment evidence would be related certainly to if a juror would ask: Well, why would he lie about this? And I'm -- I'm just asking, did the defense have any theory about what his motive would be about whether he could identify somebody, whether this first person had a mask or not. But the first time he -- he said that the person wasn't masked and provided a description was long before he saw any mug shots. It was the evening of the event. It was when he was questioned at the police station. Yes, but by doing that he's saying this person wasn't wearing a mask. That's the critical point. Well, on that point, the State says that you're drawing a meaningless distinction between a hand -- a 9-millimeter handgun and a 9-millimeter automatic pistol. Could you explain how this -- how this took place? You have a case in which you're -- you're relying almost entirely on the testimony of one witness, and you have these notes that were taken by, and are presumably in the possession of the lead investigator. Wouldn't any prosecutor ask the -- the lead -- the lead investigator, do you have any statements of this witness? They have to be examined, and if there's anything in them that's -- that is impeachable material, they have to be turned over to the defense. And under Louisiana laws, is there are a rule that requires the turning over of statements by witnesses, prior statements by witnesses? Where is that reflected in the record? I-- --What you said in your brief was that the judge determined that the supplemental report relating to the North Roman Street murders contains no Brady material. I didn't understand the record to be that all of Boatner's statements, that all the statements of Boatner that we are concerned about now were examined by the judge before-- --Before trial? And the record reflects that in where? It is your understanding that the -- that all of Boatner's, all the notes about Boatner's statements were turned over to the judge before trial for in camera inspection?

2012,Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","The statute-- --The statute says that Arizona must accept and use the Federal form. What does that mean? Let me give you two possible definitions: One, the person must be registered if the Federal form is properly completed and submitted; two, the State may not make any further inquiry of the person who submits the form. Maybe you have other definitions, but what is the -- what do you interpret “ accept and use ” to mean? Well, let me give you this example-- --A person rides up to a place to register on a bicycle and gets out and hands in the Federal form. This boy looks like he is 13 years old and he is carrying school books, he is wearing a middle school t-shirt, but he has filled out the form properly. Are they required to register him or can they ask him, could you show me some proof of age, like he would have to if he tried to buy alcohol or cigarettes? What do you make of the fact that-- --I didn't mean to interrupt your sentence. What -- what do you make of the fact that States can create their own forms? Arizona has its own form, right? And I don't believe you argue that its form is illegal. Maybe you think it is and you'll explain that. But what -- and Arizona could put on its own form a demand for the information that it -- it wants to apply to people who submit the Federal form. It seems like a very strange system. So if somebody happens to fill out the Arizona form, their application may be rejected; whereas if they had filled out the Federal form, it would be accepted. How can that be? What statutory provision would you challenge that under? There's -- there's a provision under the statute, the numbers are complicated and I don't have it on the tip of my tongue, it says what the State form must do and I didn't see anything in that that would -- that would preclude their requiring this additional proof. Well, I've read all those provisions and -- all right. Let's assume for the sake of argument that Arizona could do this on its own form. You haven't argued that their form is illegal. This seems to me like a crazy system. This is like the, you know, the IRS creating two different tax returns with different -- with different tax rates and different tax tables and how much you pay would depend on which particular form you happened to pick up and submit. May I ask you a question that I asked Ms. Millett? Does the United States think that the Arizona form is illegal? And if it is not, what sense does it make to have a system in which whether or not someone will successfully register depends on the happenstance of the particular form that the person fills out.

I would be interested in whatever limitations you think there might be on that rule, which seems to be the general rule that you're advocating. Other than the requirement of germaneness, is there anything else. Well, let me give you this example, which is mentioned in one of the amicus briefs. The government provides lots of funding to universities to -- in various forms, either directly or through student loans, in the form of tax exemptions, so anything that would be germane to the general purpose of higher education presumably could be attached as a condition to those funds. Would that be correct? With what -- with what limitations? The government could have a whole list of things, of principles that it thinks should be incorporated into higher education, and it could require a university as a condition of receiving these -- this money, let's say directed through student loans, to express agreement with all of these propositions. Would that be true. But why don't I give you another example that's along the same lines. The Federal government provides lots of funds to entities and individuals who are involved in the provision of health care. So let's suppose Congress says that we think that the issue of guns is very germane to public health, and therefore, we will not allow anybody to receive any of these funds directly or indirectly unless that entity or person proclaims agreement with whatever we happen to think at the moment about guns. So they must either say we believe that guns should be strictly limited -- access to them should be strictly limited for public health purposes or that guns should be freely available because we think that promotes public health. That would be permissible, wouldn't it? Well, why would it not? I don't want to interrupt your rebuttal, but I don't see the difference between those two, those two things that you just tried to distinguish. Well, suppose you have an organization that previously has expressed support for the legalization of -- of prostitution.

2012,Hollingsworth v. Perry,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, Mr. Olson, is it your position that the only people who could defend a ballot, a law that's adopted in California through the ballot initiative are the Attorney General and the governor, so that if the Attorney General and the governor don't like the ballot initiative, it will go undefended? Is that your position? The States are not bound by the same separation of powers doctrine that underlies the Federal Constitution. You couldn't have a Federal initiative, for example. They're free of all that. So start from the proposition that a State has standing to defend the constitutionality of a State law un -- beyond dispute. The question then is, who represents the State? Now, in a State that has initiative, the whole process would be defeated if the only people who could defend the statute are the elected public officials. The whole point -- you know this better than I do, because you're from California -- the whole point of the initiative process was to allow the people to circumvent public officials about whom they were suspicious. So if you reject that proposition, what is left is the proposition that the State -- State law can choose some other person, some other group to defend the constitutionality of a State law. And the California Supreme Court has told us that the Plaintiffs in this case are precisely those people. So how do you get around that? Seriously, Mr. Olson, if California provides all the substantive benefits of marriage to same-sex domestic partnerships, are you seriously arguing that if California -- if the State -- if the case before us now were from a State that doesn't provide any of those benefits to same-sex couples, this case would come out differently? I don't think you can have it both ways. Either this case is the same, this would be the same if this were Utah or Oklahoma, or it's different because it's California and California has provided all these-- Well, tomorrow you're going to be making a standing argument that some parties think is rather tenuous, but today, you're -- you're very strong for Article III standing? None of the-- --You want us to assess the effects of same-sex marriage, the potential effects on -- of same-sex marriage, the potential -- the effects of Proposition 8. But what is your response to the argument which has already been mentioned about the need to be cautious in light of the newness of the -- the concept of -- of same-sex marriage. The one thing that the parties in this case seem to agree on is that marriage is very important. It's thought to be a fundamental building block of society and its preservation essential for the preservation of society. Traditional marriage has been around for thousands of years. Same-sex marriage is very new. I think it was first adopted in The Netherlands in 2000. So there isn't a lot of data about its effect. And it may turn out to be a -- a good thing; it may turn out not to be a good thing, as the supporters of Proposition 8 apparently believe. But you want us to step in and render a decision based on an assessment of the effects of this institution which is newer than cell phones or the Internet? I mean we -- we are not -- we do not have the ability to see the future. On a question like that, of such fundamental importance, why should it not be left for the people, either acting through initiatives and referendums or through their elected public officials? Well, just in response to that, of course the Constitution could be amended, and -- and I think I read that the California Constitution has been amended 500 times. So it's not exactly like the U.S. Constitution.

And then it also has two other claims, two other arguments. They are State law claims, and each one is dealt with in two pages. And then the State court, intermediate court of appeals, issues an opinion that addresses only the two State law claims and says nothing about the Federal constitutional claim. You would say there that -- that it's conclusively presumed that they adjudicated the Federal constitutional claim? Why is it necessary to go so far as to require a plain statement? Why wouldn't you protect the same interests if you had a rule that said that there is a presumption that they have adjudicated the claim on the merits, but that it can be rebutted if there is a strong inference that they overlooked it or a very strong inference that they overlooked it. Then you wouldn't have situations like the one that Justice Sotomayor posed in her hypothetical or the one that I just mentioned.

2012,Oxford Health Plans v. Sutter,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Out of curiosity, Mr. Waxman, in a case like this, how is the arbitrator paid? Is the arbitrator paid by the hour or a flat fee? Can I ask you a question on something a little bit different? Did the arbitrator have -- how many parties were there to this agreement? There is Oxford on one side and how many doctors on the other side? All right. So 20,000. And the effect of the arbitrator's decision is that all of those 20,000 doctors are deemed to have agreed to class arbitration, right? And if we assume -- if I ask you to assume for the sake of argument that this agreement does not constitute an agreement to engage in class arbitration, where did the arbitrator get the authority to make that holding with respect to all of these absent class members? If they didn't agree to class arbitration, how can they -- and they didn't agree to have the arbitrator decide whether the agreement calls for -- for class arbitration. How did he purport to bind them to that decision? Wait a minute. Where did he get the authority to make that decision to interpret the contract with respect to them? You're saying he can do it with respect to Oxford because Oxford agreed to have the arbitrator decide whether this calls for class arbitration. But these other people didn't. They didn't agree to have the arbitrator decide whether it calls for class arbitration. Well, presumably they could opt out, but did they agree to be bound by this unless they opted out? That's not the usual way people are bound by litigations. No, but I think you're -- you're not -- you're not accepting my assumption that this is an incorrect interpretation of the contract. That's the assumption. This is incorrect. If we were reviewing this as an appellate court reviewing the interpretation of the contract under Stolt-Nielsen, we would say, this is wrong. This is really wrong. Okay? Assume that to be the case. Then how are they -- how are these absent people bound? And it's really not an answer to say, well, they can opt out. If they didn't agree to be bound by this arbitrator's decision, then they didn't agree to be bound absent by opting out, which is an unusual procedure for being bound by an agreement.

2012,Florida v. Harris,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","What is wrong with the State's argument that field performance records are not very probative because dogs detect odors, they don't detect the physical presence of the substance that created the odor, and therefore so-called false alerts, cases in which a search was performed and no contraband was found are not really cases of false alerts. What's wrong with that? Well, that may all be true, but then what -- what can one infer from the fact that a dog alerted a number of times when no contraband was found? I think what you just said was the explanation could be the dog detected an odor, but the substance wasn't there, or it could be that the dog was cued or the dog was confused or the dog is not very competent. So what can one infer from these field performance records? Well, excuse me. Where -- when nothing is found, how can you tell whether the dog alerted to a residual odor or simply made a mistake? Now, there may be cases where there is other evidence that suggests that drugs were present in that location, and, therefore, that is something from which you can infer that the dog was alerting to residual odor; but, the fact that you don't have evidence of that doesn't mean that there wasn't residual odor. Was that the holding in the Florida supreme court, that there was no probable cause because the dog alerted to the wrong part of the truck? Was it any part of their reasoning?

2012,United States v. Windsor,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, the Solicitor General's standing argument is very abstract. But here is one possible way of understanding it, perhaps the Solicitor General will disavow it, but it would go like this: The President's position in this case is that he is going to continue to enforce DOMA, engage in conduct that he believes is unconstitutional, until this Court tells him to stop. The judgment of the Second Circuit told the Executive Branch to comply with the Equal Protection Clause immediately. The President disagrees with the temporal aspect of that, so the Executive is aggrieved in the sense that the Executive is ordered to do something prior to the point when the Executive believes it should do that thing. Now, wouldn't that be sufficient to make -- to create injury in the Executive and render the Executive an aggrieved party? Well, how are you aggrieved? “ Aggrieved ” means that you are deprived of your legal rights. And you don't think that you've been deprived of your legal rights because your rights -- your obligations under the Constitution supercede DOMA, and you haven't been deprived of anything that you're entitled to under the Constitution. So how are you aggrieved? Could I just -- before you go on to the House group, could I just clear up something? In your brief, you argue that you are representing all three branches of the Government, is that right? You're -- you're representing the Judiciary as you stand before us here today-- --trying to persuade the Court, you're representing the Court? It seems very strange. So in -- in a criminal case where it's the United States v.-- Smith, appearing before an Article III judge, the United States, the prosecutor is representing the court as well? Then why is-- --Then why is it sufficient for one house to take the position that the statute is constitutional? The enactment of legislation requires both houses, and usually the signature of the President. Well, if the law is passed by a bare majority of one of the houses, then each member of that -- of that house who was part of the majority has the same interest in defending its constitutionality. Well, could I ask you this question: On the question of the House resolution-- --if -- if a house -- if one of the houses passes a resolution saying that a particular group was always authorized to represent us, do you think it's consistent with the separation of powers for us to examine whether that's a correct interpretation of the rules of that House of Congress? Suppose we look just at the estate tax provision that's at issue in this case, which provides specially favorable treatment to a married couple as opposed to any other individual or economic unit. What was the purpose of that? Was the purpose of that really to foster traditional marriage, or was Congress just looking for a convenient category to capture households that function as a unified economic unit? Well, Congress could have achieved exactly what it achieved under Section 3 by excising the term “ married ” from the United States Code and replacing it with something more neutral. It could have said “ certified domestic units ”, and then defined this in exactly the way that Section 3 -- exactly the way DOMA defines “ marriage ”. Would that make a difference? In that instance, the Federal Government wouldn't be purporting to say who is married and who is not married; it would be saying who is entitled to various Federal benefits and burdens based on a Federal definition. Can I take you back to the example that you began with, where a member of the military is injured. So let's say three soldiers are injured and they are all in same-sex relationships, and in each instance the other partner in this relationship wants to visit the soldier in a hospital. First is a spouse in a State that allows same-sex marriage, the second is a domestic partner in a State that an allows that but not same-sex marriage, the third is in an equally committed loving relationship in a State that doesn't involve either. Now, your argument is that under Federal law the first would be admitted, should be admitted, but the other two would be kept out? Let me take you back to the example. Your -- your position seems to me, yes, one gets in, two stay out, even though your legal arguments would lead to the conclusion that they all should be treated the same. Well, let me get to the question I asked Mr. Clement. It just gets rid of the word “ marriage ”, takes it out of the U.S. Code completely. Substitutes something else, and defines it as same-sex -- to include same-sex couples. Surely it could do that. So it's just the word “ marriage ”? And it's just the fact that they use this term “ marriage ”? But if the estate tax follows State law, would not that create an equal protection problem similar to the one that exists here? Suppose there were a dispute about the -- the State of residence of your client and her partner or spouse. Was it New York, was it some other State where same-sex marriage would not have been recognized? And suppose there was -- the State court said the State of residence is a State where it's not recognized. Would -- would you not have essentially the same equal protection argument there that you have now? Just -- if I could follow up with one -- one question. What if the -- the hypothetical surviving spouse, partner in North Carolina, brought an equal protection argument, saying that there is no -- it is unconstitutional to treat me differently because I am a resident of North Carolina rather than a resident of New York. What would be -- would that be discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation? What would be the level of scrutiny? Would it survive? ",well the solicitor general s standing argument be very abstract but here be one possible way of understand it perhaps the solicitor general will disavow it but it would go like this the president s position in this case be that he be go to continue to enforce doma engage in conduct that he believe be unconstitutional until this court tell him to stop the judgment of the second circuit tell the

2012,Maryland v. King,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Before you get on to -- before you go to that, fingerprints have been taken I believe from people who are booked for offenses for many, many, many years; isn't that right? When did the FBI's AFIS system for comparing fingerprints by computer begin? Well, the question that I had was this: If the constitutionality of taking fingerprints is dependent on the speed with which a fingerprint comparison can be done now by a computerized system, would that mean that the taking of fingerprints was unconstitutional back in, let's say, the '50s when that wasn't possible and fingerprints could only be compared manually? Well, do you think the intrusion is worse when you just take a swab and you go inside somebody's cheek, as opposed to rolling fingerprints? Which is the greater intrusion? Which is-- --Well, the thrust of a lot of what we have been presented with in the briefs and what we have heard this morning -- and by the way, I think this is perhaps the most important criminal procedure case that this Court has heard in decades. The attorney for the State began by listing a number of crimes just in Maryland that had been solved using this. So this is what is at stake: Lots of murders, lots of rapes that can be -- that can be solved using this new technology that involves a very minimal intrusion on personal privacy. But why isn't this the fingerprinting of the 21st century? What is the difference? If it was permissible and it's been assumed to be so for decades, that it is permissible to fingerprint anybody who's booked, why is it not permissible to take a DNA sample from anybody who is arrested? Well, as to the first, in our cases involving searches for -- where a urine sample is taken to determine drug use. The urine can be analyzed for all sorts of things besides the presence of drugs, and the Court has said in those cases, we are only going to consider that -- we are considering that this is a reasonable search with respect to the determination of whether the person has taken drugs, not all the other information-- --that can be obtained from it. What was the purpose of fingerprinting before it was possible to make fingerprint comparisons by computer? Well, I would assume that before it was possible to do computer searches, the way in which fingerprinting established identification, what it did in that respect was to identify the person arrested on this occasion so that if the person was arrested again, then the police would know that it was the same person. There was no way of -- no practicable way of taking the fingerprints of somebody who was booked and determining whether that person -- you didn't have anything to compare it to. And they certainly -- you couldn't do it manually. Yes, so you know that on day one you have arrested -- you've arrested Mr. X, and then a year later you arrest somebody else and you know it's Mr. X again. And DNA can do exactly the same thing except more accurately. What if someone has a bloody shirt and throws it away in the trash -- in a public trash can along the street, you are saying that the police can't analyze that without a search warrant? But your client was convicted of the offense of arrest. And it was a serious offense punishable by up to 10 years imprisonment-- --Isn't that correct? And he was sentenced to 4 years. For Fourth Amendment purposes -- for Fourth Amendment purposes, do you think that it is -- that it is permissible to take a DNA sample from someone who is convicted of an offense that would qualify as a felony under common law? ",before you get on to before you go to that fingerprint have be take i believe from people who be book for offense for many many many year be not that right when do the fbi s afis system for compare fingerprint by computer begin well the question that i have be this if the constitutionality of take fingerprint be dependent on the speed with which a fingerprint comparison can be do now by a computerized system would that mean that the taking of fingerprint be unconstitutional back in let us say the s when that be not possible and fingerprint could only be compare manually well do you think the intrusion be bad when you just take a swab and you go inside somebody s cheek as oppose to roll fingerprint which be the great intrusion which be well the thrust of a lot of what we have be present with in the brief and what we have hear this morning and by the way i think this be perhaps the most important criminal procedure case that this court have hear in decade the attorney for the state begin by list a number of crime just in maryland that have be solve use this so this be what be at stake lot of murder lot of rape that can be that can be solve use this new technology that involve a very minimal intrusion on personal privacy but why be not this the fingerprinting of the st century what be the difference if it be permissible and it be be assume to be so for decade that it be permissible to fingerprint anybody who be book why be it not permissible to take a dna sample from anybody who be arrest well as to the first in our case involve search for where a urine sample be take to determine drug use the urine can be analyze for all sort of thing besides the presence of drug and the court have say in those case we be only go to consider that we be consider that this be a reasonable search with respect to the determination of whether the person have take drug not all the other information that can be obtain from it what be the purpose of fingerprint before it be possible to make fingerprint comparison by computer well i would assume that before it be possible to do computer search the way in which fingerprint establish identification what it do in that respect be to identify the person arrest on this occasion so that if the person be arrest again then the police would know that it be the same person there be no way of no practicable way of take the fingerprint of somebody who be book and determine whether that person you do not have anything to compare it to and they certainly you could not do it manually yes so you know that on day one you have arrest you have arrest mr x and then a year later you arrest somebody else and you know it be mr x again and dna can do exactly the same thing except more accurately what if someone have a bloody shirt and throw it away in the trash in a public trash can along the street you be say that the police can not analyze that without a search warrant but your client be convict of the offense of arrest and it be a serious offense punishable by up to year imprisonment be not that correct and he be sentence to year for fourth amendment purpose for fourth amendment purpose do you think that it be that it be permissible to take a dna sample from someone who be convict of an offense that would qualify as a felony under common law ,215.68,Roberts Court,"Feb 26, 2013",Maryland,"Alonzo Jay King, Jr.",12-207,"Nov 9, 2012","Jun 3, 2013",112,1.0,1.0,0.0,1
2012,University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Did this court ever hold that a Price Waterhouse framework applied to retaliation claims? As of 1991 -- well, Gomez-Perez and Jackson came after 1991, right? So as of 1991, was there any case, any decision of this Court other than Sullivan, that could have possibly led Congress to a conclusion that the general prohibition against discrimination included a prohibition of retaliation? I take you back to your opening statement that there is no reason why Congress might have wanted to have a different standard for substantive discrimination and retaliation. Would you disagree with the proposition that the motivating factor analysis creates special problems in the retaliation -- in the retaliation context? Well, I know it's not going to go away. Let me give you this example, this hypothetical. An employee thinks that he is about to be fired. And let's -- let's suppose that the employer really has a good, nondiscriminatory reason for firing the employee. On the eve of that the employee makes a spurious charge of discrimination and does it in a way to maximize the embarrassment to the employer. Then the employer formally makes the decision to terminate the employee. And what the employer says at that time is, we were going to fire so and so anyway for all these other reasons, but now because he has done this and really embarrassed us publicly, we are really happy that we are going to fire him. Now, how does that work out under the motivating factor analysis? Is that correct? Can't you -- can't you succeed on a retaliation claim if your underlying substantive claim is invalid. Well, no, I understand that. And it's not a policy question. It's a question of interpreting the statute. But I understood your lead argument in favor of a particular interpretation of the statute to be it can't mean what the Petitioner wants it to mean, what the Petitioner says it means, because that would make no sense. And the point of my question was to explore the possibility that there might be a very good reason why Congress would want a different causation standard for substantive discrimination and retaliation. Price Waterhouse is a little different from subsection (m) though, isn't it? You have to have proof of -- you have to have direct evidence of a substantial -- direct and substantial evidence before you get into Price Waterhouse, right? You don't need that under subsection (m). Isn't it the case that Justice O'Connor's opinion in Price Waterhouse required direct evidence and substantial evidence before there was a shift in the burden of proof. That's -- that's a fair point, but it's, like, if we change it a little bit so that it's -- it's not frivolous, but it is clearly groundless once its examined, then you still have the problem. The problem is-- --The problem is this: It's one thing to say, and it's a good thing to say to employers: When you are making employment decisions, you take race out of your mind, take gender out of your mind, take national origin out of your mind. It's not something you can even think about. But when you are talking about retaliation, when you are talking about an employer who has been, perhaps publicly, charged with discrimination and the employer knows that the charge is not a good charge, it's pretty -- it's very, very difficult to say to that employer and very difficult for the employer to say: I'm going to take this completely out of my mind. I'm not even going to think about the fact that I am -- have been wrongfully charged with discrimination. Isn't that a real difference? ",do this court ever hold that a price waterhouse framework apply to retaliation claim as of well gomez perez and jackson come after right so as of be there any case any decision of this court other than sullivan that could have possibly lead congress to a conclusion that the general prohibition against discrimination include a prohibition of retaliation i take you back to your open statement that there be no reason why congress might have want to have a different standard for substantive discrimination and retaliation would you disagree with the proposition that the motivating factor analysis create special problem in the retaliation in the retaliation context well i know it be not go to go away let me give you this example this hypothetical an employee think that he be about to be fire and let us let us suppose that the employer really have a good nondiscriminatory reason for fire the employee on the eve of that the employee make a spurious charge of discrimination and do it in a way to maximize the embarrassment to the employer then the employer formally make the decision to terminate the employee and what the employer say at that time be we we be go to fire so and so anyway for all these other reason but now because he have do this and really embarrass us publicly we be really happy that we be go to fire him now how do that work out under the motivating factor analysis be that correct can not you can not you succeed on a retaliation claim if your underlying substantive claim be invalid well no i understand that and it be not a policy question it be a question of interpret the statute but i understood your lead argument in favor of a particular interpretation of the statute to be it can not mean what the petitioner want it to mean what the petitioner say it mean because that would make no sense and the point of my question be to explore the possibility that there might be a very good reason why congress would want a different causation standard for substantive discrimination and retaliation price waterhouse be a little different from subsection m though be not it you have to have proof of you have to have direct evidence of a substantial direct and substantial evidence before you get into price waterhouse right you do not need that under subsection m be not it the case that justice oconnor s opinion in price waterhouse require direct evidence and substantial evidence before there be a shift in the burden of proof that be that be a fair point but it be like if we change it a little bit so that it be it be not frivolous but it be clearly groundless once its examine then you still have the problem the problem be the problem be this it be one thing to say and it be a good thing to say to employer when you be make employment decision you take race out of your mind take gender out of your mind take national origin out of your mind it be not something you can even think about but when you be talk about retaliation when you be talk about an employer who have be perhaps publicly charge with discrimination and the employer know that the charge be not a good charge it be pretty it be very very difficult to say to that employer and very difficult for the employer to say I be go to take this completely out of my mind I be not even go to think about the fact that i be have be wrongfully charge with discrimination be not that a real difference ,234.25000000000009,Roberts Court,"Apr 24, 2013",University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center,Naiel Nassar,12-484,"Jan 18, 2013","Jun 24, 2013",112,1.0,1.0,0.0,1

But you're making -- you keep making the hypotheticals easier than they're intended to be. It's not just the case of taking the leaf off the tree and chewing it. Let's say if you do that, you'd have to eat a whole forest to get the -- the value of this. But it's extracted and -- and reduced to a concentrated form. That's not patent -- that's not eligible? Well, when you concede that, then I'm not sure how you distinguish the isolated DNA here, because it has a different function. Will you dispute that? Isolated DNA has a very different function from the DNA as it exists in nature. And although the chemical composition may not be different, it -- it certainly is in a different form. So what is the distinction? Well, the issue here is a very difficult one. It's one on which the Government has changed its position; isn't that correct? It seems that there is disagreement within the Executive Branch about it. This case has been structured in an effort to get us to decide this on the broadest possible ground, that there's no argument, that it's just about 101, it's not about any other provision of the Patent Act. Why -- why should we -- why should we do that? We have claims that if patent eligibility is denied here it will prevent investments that are necessary for the development of new drugs or it will lead those who develop the new drugs, new diagnostic techniques, to keep those secret, not disclose them to the public. Why -- why should we jump in and -- and decide the broadest possible question? Why is the chemical composition in the isolated DNA different? You were about to explain that. But isn't this just a question of probability? To get back to your baseball bat example, which at least I -- I can understand better than perhaps some of this biochemistry, I suppose that in, you know, I don't know how many millions of years trees have been around, but in all of that time possibly someplace a branch has fallen off a tree and it's fallen into the ocean and it's been manipulated by the waves, and then something's been washed up on the shore, and what do you know, it's a baseball bat.

And if they did that, wouldn't they defer to the Scottish courts for custody determination? Well, if you -- if you could take an appeal and got a reversal of the decision -- of the order removing the child to -- allowing the child to be removed to Scotland, wouldn't that undermine the -- the judgment for costs?

Is that your argument? That's a merits question, not a mootness question. Well, if I understand your answer to Justice Kagan, your argument is dependent on the proposition that under the Convention that once the child has left this country, a U.S. court no longer has any power to order the child to come back; is that right? And I don't see where that was decided either by the court in this case or in the Beckier case that the Eleventh Circuit panel here cited. There is no discussion in either of those opinions of the -- how the Convention -- what the Convention says on this question. No, no. This is not a -- this is not a question about our general standard of mootness. This is a question of the meaning of the Convention. As I understood your argument to Justice Kagan, your position is dependent on a particular interpretation of the Convention.

2012,Henderson v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","May I ask you what you think is the purpose of the Plain-Error Rule? Suppose that it was proposed to amend Rule 52(b) to take out the word “ plain ”, so that the rule would read simply, ""an error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the Court's attention. "" So what does -- in your judgment, what does the word “ plain ” add? What -- what purposes does it serve? But what purpose does it serve? Why should the rule not be that if -- if some -- if there was an error, and it was a really -- it was an error that really badly hurt the defendant, then it can be considered, even though it wasn't raised at whatever time it had to have been -- it wasn't raised, there wasn't an objection? What purpose does that serve? Well, but I'm not asking why we have -- why we permit plain errors to be raised. I'm asking why do we require that the error be plain in order for it to be considered? Well, let me suggest two purposes it serves. It follows from the adversary system, and it serves judicial efficiency. Would you agree with that; those are the purposes of it? All right. Does it serve those purposes better as applied at the time of trial or at the time of appeal? Yes. Does it serve -- does it serve judicial efficiency better to say that we apply the Plain-Error Rule at the time of trial or at the time of appeal? Well, if you apply it at the time of trial, it may eliminate the need for an appellate court, under some circumstances, to get to the ultimate question of whether there was error; or, it could say, there might have been error, but it wasn't -- it's not plain to us, I suppose. So you have that efficiency. But if you apply it at the time of trial, you avoid retrials. So which is -- which of those two is more consistent with the purpose of serving judicial efficiency? Then let me ask you this question. Counsel, then let me ask you this related question. Something happens at trial. There isn't an objection. And it goes up on appeal. And the -- the appellate court, there is an argument about whether it's a plain error or not. And the appellate court says, first of all, we think it was an error, but it's a -- it was a close question. We had trouble with this. So it wasn't plain, and, therefore, this defendant is out of luck. What's the justification for that? No, I mean in real world terms. What -- what purpose is served by that? If the court has concluded that there was an error, and it affected substantial rights, but it wasn't plain, what -- what justification is there for saying, that's too bad? You know, you really got hurt, but it wasn't clear until -- you know, it wasn't plain until we decided this case, so go back to prison. What's the purpose for that? Then why should it have to be plain at the time of appeal? You could promote efficiency at the appellate stage by having a rule like the rule that we have in qualified immunity cases, which gives a court the discretion to decide whether something was clear or go to the -- to the merits of the argument. You could -- that's -- you can serve efficiency by having that. But the Plain-Error Rule doesn't do that. In the situation I gave you, the court would say there was an error, it really affected your substantial rights, but we can't say it was plain to us until we decided this case, and, therefore, you get no relief. And -- and maybe there's a reason for that. I'm waiting for you to tell me what the reason for it is. What about Mr. Henderson sitting in prison, serving a sentence that we now know was imposed for a reason that is not permitted under Federal sentencing law?

2012,Smith v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, I'm having trouble understanding how your argument would work. Let's say that the defense calls a witness other than the defendant to testify to a conversation in which the defendant allegedly withdrew from the conspiracy, and by doing that, satisfies its burden of production. Now, you say the government has the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt not only that this conversation didn't occur, but also that the defendant never withdrew at any other time during the limitations period. Isn't that where your argument would lead? But how can they prove that he did not withdraw at any other time during this conspiracy? Aren't you transforming the nature of withdrawal? You are seeming to argue that the government has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt active participation in the conspiracy during the statute of limitations period rather than the affirmative withdrawal from the conspiracy. Ms. Harrington, would you agree that as this argument is developing, what really is at issue has less to do with the statute of limitations than the nature of conspiracy? And one view is Petitioners', and it's embodied in some of the questions that has been -- that have been asked, and it's this: that the crime is continuing to participate as a member of a conspiracy. And the other view is that a conspiracy is a dangerous thing. It's like rounding up a -- a pack of lions or wolves, or setting loose some thing that continues to be a danger, and if you do that thing, by joining it you are liable criminally for everything that happens after that, even if at a certain point you walk away, and you do nothing. Now if -- if he's right, that it is active membership, then there may be a problem for you here. But if the other view is correct, that you are liable for setting this thing in motion, whether or not you continue to do anything active in support of it during the limitations period, then you are correct. Now which is the -- which is the established view of the crime of conspiracy? I think the crux of your argument is that the government is going to have to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, active participation in the conspiracy during the statute of limitations period, because it is impossible for the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that on no day during a five-year period did the defendant withdraw from the conspiracy. It simply can't be done. This person was under 24-hour video surveillance for the whole five-year period. And say what? That there was insufficient evidence to prove-- --the opposite of what they have to prove? I thought you argue that every day that there is -- that something has to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt because the prosecution hasn't provided sufficient evidence? Couldn't you argue they have the burden of proving that the defendant did not withdraw during this five-year period? They have the burden of proving that. And did you hear any evidence from them that -- did you hear evidence disproving that -- that he didn't withdraw during that period? There is no evidence on that. You can make that argument? ",well I be have trouble understand how your argument would work let us say that the defense call a witness other than the defendant to testify to a conversation in which the defendant allegedly withdraw from the conspiracy and by do that satisfy its burden of production now you say the government have the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt not only that this conversation do not occur but also that the defendant never withdraw at any other time during the limitation period be not that where your argument would lead but how can they prove that he do not withdraw at any other time during this conspiracy be not you transform the nature of withdrawal you be seem to argue that the government have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt active participation in the conspiracy during the statute of limitation period rather than the affirmative withdrawal from the conspiracy ms harrington would you agree that as this argument be develop what really be at issue have less to do with the statute of limitation than the nature of conspiracy and one view be petitioner and it be embody in some of the question that have be that have be ask and it have this that the crime be continue to participate as a member of a conspiracy and the other view be that a conspiracy be a dangerous thing it be like round up a a pack of lion or wolf or set loose some thing that continue to be a danger and if you do that thing by join it you be liable criminally for everything that happen after that even if at a certain point you walk away and you do nothing now if if he be right that it be active membership then there may be a problem for you here but if the other view be correct that you be liable for set this thing in motion whether or not you continue to do anything active in support of it during the limitation period then you be correct now which be the which be the established view of the crime of conspiracy i think the crux of your argument be that the government be go to have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt active participation in the conspiracy during the statute of limitation period because it be impossible for the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that on no day during a five year period do the defendant withdraw from the conspiracy it simply can not be do this person be under hour video surveillance for the whole five year period and say what that there be insufficient evidence to prove the opposite of what they have to prove i think you argue that every day that there be that something have to be prove beyond a reasonable doubt because the prosecution have not provide sufficient evidence could not you argue they have the burden of prove that the defendant do not withdraw during this five year period they have the burden of prove that and do you hear any evidence from them that do you hear evidence disprove that that he do not withdraw during that period there be no evidence on that you can make that argument ,196.18000000000006,Roberts Court,"Nov 6, 2012","Calvin Smith, et al.",United States,11-8976,"Jun 18, 2012","Jan 9, 2013",112,0.0,1.0,0.0,0

2012,Missouri v. McNeely,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Jurisdictions have an incentive to get a warrant, I would think. Even if they -- even if we were to say that they don't need one, they certainly have a strong incentive to get warrants because it insulates the search to a much greater degree from later challenge at a suppression hearing. So why shouldn't it depend on the practicalities in a particular jurisdiction? Not every jurisdiction has prosecutors and judges who are staying up at, you know, 3:00 o'clock in the morning on Sunday morning waiting for the phone to ring or for -- to receive some sort of an electronic message that there has been a stop and somebody wants a -- wants a search warrant. Maybe, you know, big jurisdictions can do that, but small ones can't. So why -- but if you are in a big jurisdiction that -- or one that feels that they can afford that, then why should -- you know, why should the Fourth Amendment permit the search to take place without the warrant when it could have been obtained-- What if the State has a form; we have forms in the Joint Appendix. What if it has a form for the officer to fill out? He checks certain boxes, and then you send this electronically to a magistrate, and if the right boxes are checked, the magistrate will grant the warrant. Is that -- do you think that is consistent with the Fourth Amendment? Suppose you are in a rural jurisdiction and it takes a long time to rouse a prosecutor and a magistrate at 3:00 in the morning to get the warrant. You would say, that's too bad, everybody has -- the whole country has to operate like New York City, you have to have somebody on duty all the time. But I'm asking you a hypothetical question. I bet there are places like that. I have encountered magistrate -- federal magistrate judges who were unreceptive to receiving warrant applications in the middle of the night, and that is known to -- to exist. Suppose you have a jurisdiction like that? Does that count as a circumstance that would justify a warrantless taking of blood? That's not true, because there's a great advantage to the prosecution in having a search with a warrant as opposed to a warrantless search in terms of suppression; isn't that correct? Can I ask you this question? How much blood has to be taken in order to test for blood alcohol? What if medical technology advances to -- I gather it's a -- it's a substantial amount. But what if it advances to the point that you don't need any more blood than you need now to test blood sugar, and you just have a little machine that makes a tiny prick in somebody's finger and you've got enough blood to do a blood alcohol test. Does it change then? Well, if they had sent more police officers to the scene, they could have done everything faster. If they had sent more police officers to the scene of the accident, if they -- then they could have done it faster. So what's the difference between that practical limitation and the limitation that exists in a world -- in a rural jurisdiction?

2012,Vance v. Ball State University,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, could you point out what the materially augments rule means? Could you provide a definition of that? The authority to assign daily tasks has to be sufficient to do what? There are situations where the assignment of responsibilities is extremely unpleasant, and so it's easy to see how the testimony would apply in that situation. But there are also a lot of situations, like the Chief Justice's example, where it's really very unclear. I don't know how courts are going to -- how courts can grapple with that. You said that being subjected to country music or hard rock or Wagner, you know, every single day in the workplace would not be sufficient. I don't know. Some people might think that it was -- that that is. What was the most unpleasant thing that Davis could have assigned the Petitioner to do? Could it be chopping onions all day, every day? But that would materially augment? Chopping onions all day would be enough? Chopping -- how about chopping other things, just chopping? You are the sous-chef, you are going to be chopping all day every day. Would that be enough? Well, isn't cleaning the toilets a limited -- isn't the authority to decide who cleans the toilets the same as the authority to decide what the music is going to be? It's one thing. I thought -- and your answer on the music was, well, that probably wouldn't count because it's the authority to decide just one thing. But your argument is if the only authority was to decide who cleans the toilets, then -- then that would not -- that wouldn't count, because that's just one thing. Well, that can't possibly be what the case means. Suppose that it's -- it's the assignment of offices, and all of the offices except one have heating and air conditioning, but one has no heating and no air conditioning. And so -- and that's the only authority that this person has is to assign desks. That person says, if you don't do whatever it is that I want you to do, I'm putting you in the office where there's no heating, and there's no air conditioning. And you would say that doesn't count because it's just one thing. It's not a broad range of authorities -- of authorities. The conclusion in your brief is that the judgment of the court of appeals should be vacated and the case remanded for further proceedings, and now -- now you are telling us that we should -- we should basically write an opinion on summary judgment. We took this case to decide whether the Faragher and Ellerth -- and Ellerth supervisory liability rule is limited to those harassers who have the power to hire, fire, demote, promote, transfer, or discipline their victim. And your answer to that is no; is that right? All right. Well, if we -- if we agree with that without having any party defending the rule that was adopted by three circuits, then surely -- well, then, why shouldn't we just remand this case for the lower courts to decide this, this summary judgment issue, and -- and permit further development of the record if the record isn't fully developed? I understand Mr. Ortiz to say that there's at least a dispute of fact about whether Davis could have controlled what Petitioner did on a daily basis. Doesn't her job description say that she can assign tasks in the kitchen? What guidance would your -- what guidance would the kind of opinion that you're suggesting we write really provide? The -- the guidance would be that if someone has no authority to assign daily work, then that person isn't -- and also has no authority to hire, fire, promote, et cetera, then that person isn't a supervisor. How much guidance is that? If you were willing to concede that this would be a close case under the Second Circuit standard or under the EEOC guidance, then there might be an argument in favor of our applying those tests -- or one of those tests to the facts of the case, because then that might provide some guidance, even though we are supposed to be a court of review, not a court of first view. But you're saying this is an extremely weak case under those standards; and, therefore, what is -- what benefit is there in our applying this?

2012,McQuiggin v. Perkins,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","I have some difficulty understanding what the Sixth Circuit was doing. And maybe you can help me with that. The district court as I understand it said to the Petitioner: You lose for two reasons. First, you don't really have evidence of actual innocence, not enough anyway; and second -- and I can understand that, because the evidence -- well, the most that is suggested by the affidavits is that Jones was a participant in this murder, not that Perkins was not responsible for the murder. But anyway, so you lose for two reasons. First, you don't really have evidence of actual innocence; second, you weren't diligent. The Sixth Circuit grants a certificate of appealability only on the issue of diligence and they say diligence doesn't make any difference. Well, where does that leave the petitioner? He's already lost on the question of whether there's evidence of actual innocence and there was no appeal on that issue. Well, that may be what they're contemplating, but they can't get to the issue of whether the district court adequately addressed the issue of adequate innocence -- of actual innocence unless that issue is before them. And the issue isn't supposed to be before them unless -- isn't before them unless the certificate of appealability was issued, and there was no certificate of appealability on that issue. Well, I don't understand that. The district court -- or you seem to suggest the district court was wrong in saying that there wasn't sufficient evidence for an actual-innocence claim. Maybe that's the case, maybe it was wrong. But if it decided that issue and the issue wasn't appealed, then the issue is settled. And that's the problem that I see. Now, how do you get around that? Did you ask for a certificate -- what other issues did you ask for a certificate of appealability on? What other issues did he ask for a certificate on? Well, you are asking for what is potentially a very big exception to the 1-year statute of limitations. If you took a poll of all of the prisoners in Michigan, how many of them do you think would say they are actually innocent? Very few would say they are actually innocent? Oh, credibly say. But how many would say that they are actually innocent? A lot. And a lot would be able to come up with evidence that is equal to what the petition -- what the Respondent here has come up with. Now, do you think it's plausible that Congress, in establishing this new 1-year statute of limitations because it doesn't want these things to drag on indefinitely, intended to create an exemption that broad so that anybody who claims to be actually innocent can at least get over -- can get to the point where the Court has to decide whether the -- has to weigh this evidence of actual innocence to see whether it gets over the threshold? Is that plausible given what Congress was trying to do in AEDPA? But that's very odd, because if you have somebody who's actually innocent, then you're saying that person can't get out of prison unless the person happens to have a good constitutional claim that's totally unrelated to the fact that the person is actually innocent. That's very odd, isn't it? Well, assuming for the sake of argument that there is this exception. Why shouldn't diligence be required? How can it be equitable to allow someone to bring a claim when the person has -- involving new evidence, when the person has not been diligent in presenting this new evidence to the court? Well, as your -- as your adversary says, there's nothing really procedurally complicated about filing a Federal habeas. There -- there are forms -- I've read hundreds of them that have been filed by pro se petitioners, and there is nothing technical about claiming: “ I'm innocent of this offense ”. This isn't a legal issue. It's something anybody can understand. I've got an -- I've got my sister's affidavit, I have an affidavit by a third person, I have an affidavit by a person who worked in the dry cleaning shop that shows that I'm actually innocent. Why doesn't -- what is the reason for waiting 5 years to file that? But I -- I don't understand your answer about why it took him 5 years from the -- from obtaining the last affidavit to the filing of the Federal habeas. You said he couldn't get a lawyer. He really didn't need a lawyer to do this. He didn't have access to a library. This isn't a legal issue, this isn't a complicated legal issue. It's a factual issue that anybody who watches detective shows on TV can understand.

You could wait 5 years, you could wait 10 years, you could wait 15 years; it doesn't matter? That's what AEDPA was intended to do? ",i have some difficulty understand what the sixth circuit be do and maybe you can help me with that the district court as i understand it say to the petitioner you lose for two reason first you do not really have evidence of actual innocence not enough anyway and second and i can understand that because the evidence well the most that be suggest by the affidavit be that jones be a participant in this murder not that perkins be not responsible for the murder but anyway so you lose for two reason first you do not really have evidence of actual innocence second you be not diligent the sixth circuit grant a certificate of appealability only on the issue of diligence and they say diligence do not make any difference well where do that leave the petitioner he be already lose on the question of whether there be evidence of actual innocence and there be no appeal on that issue well that may be what they be contemplate but they can not get to the issue of whether the district court adequately address the issue of adequate innocence of actual innocence unless that issue be before them and the issue be not suppose to be before them unless be not before them unless the certificate of appealability be issue and there be no certificate of appealability on that issue well i do not understand that the district court or you seem to suggest the district court be wrong in say that there be not sufficient evidence for an actual innocence claim maybe that be the case maybe it be wrong but if it decide that issue and the issue be not appeal then the issue be settle and that be the problem that i see now how do you get around that do you ask for a certificate what other issue do you ask for a certificate of appealability on what other issue do he ask for a certificate on well you be ask for what be potentially a very big exception to the year statute of limitation if you take a poll of all of the prisoner in michigan how many of them do you think would say they be actually innocent very few would say they be actually innocent oh credibly say but how many would say that they be actually innocent a lot and a lot would be able to come up with evidence that be equal to what the petition what the respondent here have come up with now do you think it be plausible that congress in establish this new year statute of limitation because it do not want these thing to drag on indefinitely intend to create an exemption that broad so that anybody who claim to be actually innocent can at least get over can get to the point where the court have to decide whether the have to weigh this evidence of actual innocence to see whether it get over the threshold be that plausible give what congress be try to do in aedpa but that be very odd because if you have somebody who be actually innocent then you be say that person can not get out of prison unless the person happen to have a good constitutional claim that be totally unrelated to the fact that the person be actually innocent that be very odd be not it well assume for the sake of argument that there be this exception why should not diligence be require how can it be equitable to allow someone to bring a claim when the person have involve new evidence when the person have not be diligent in present this new evidence to the court well as your as your adversary say there be nothing really procedurally complicate about file a federal habeas there there be form I have read hundred of them that have be file by pro se petitioner and there be nothing technical about claim I be innocent of this offense this be not a legal issue it be something anybody can understand I have get an I have get my sister s affidavit i have an affidavit by a third person i have an affidavit by a person who work in the dry cleaning shop that show that I be actually innocent why do not what be the reason for wait year to file that but i i do not understand your answer about why it take him year from the from obtain the last affidavit to the filing of the federal habeas you say he could not get a lawyer he really do not need a lawyer to do this he do not have access to a library this be not a legal issue this be not a complicated legal issue it be a factual issue that anybody who watch detective show on tv can understand but you think that congress which in aedpa be try to speed all this up and get rid of the delay and make thing simple intend to allow that you could wait year you could wait year you could wait year it do not matter that be what aedpa be intend to do ,278.63,Roberts Court,"Feb 25, 2013","Greg McQuiggin, Warden",Floyd Perkins,12-126,"Oct 29, 2012","May 28, 2013",112,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2012,Florida v. Jardines,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, I think your first reason is -- is so broad, it is clearly incorrect. It's so broad, you ought to go on to your second reason. You know, we've had hundreds of years of trespass cases in this country and in England. Has there -- do you have a single case holding that it is a trespass for a person with a dog to walk up to the front door of a house? That really wasn't my question, was it? If a dog on a leash is brought up to the front door of a person's house, was that a trespass at the time when the Fourth Amendment was adopted? What is the case that says that? You don't have the case. What if he goes to-- --he goes to deliver the tickets, and he sniffs? He doesn't intend to sniff before he goes, but he goes the deliver the tickets, and he smells the marijuana. Is that a search? Well, he doing exactly the same thing. Two officers go up to two identical houses. One goes up with the subjective intent to sniff. The other one goes up with the subjective intent to drop off the tickets to the Policeman's Ball. Your answer is one is a search, one is not a search. I thought the relevance of technology was that the technology that we have now was not necessarily -- was not -- much of it was not available at the time when the Fourth Amendment was adopted, so we can't tell what the -- what people in 1791 would have thought about it. But that's not true of dogs. Dogs were around. They have been around for 10,000 years. --and they've been used -- and they've been used to detect scents for 10,000 -- for thousands of years. Certainly, they were available for that purpose in 1791, weren't they? But they had been trained to track people, had they not? So in 1791, if someone -- if the police were using -- or somebody was using a bloodhound to track someone who was suspected of a crime, and the bloodhound -- and they used the bloodhound to track the person to the front of -- to the front door of a house, would that have been regarded as a trespass? And what's the case that says that? Without implied consent. Actual or implied consent. Well, are there cases that say that the implied consent exists only where the person is coming to the door for a purpose that the homeowner would approve if the homeowner knew the purpose of the person coming to the door? So why is that? Why is that? If you took a poll of people and said do you want -- do you want police officers who suspect you of possibly engaging in criminal conduct to come to your front door and knock on the door so they can talk to you and attempt to get incriminating information out of you, would most people say, yeah, I consent to that? You draw a distinction between dogs that are not drug detection dogs and ordinary dogs. Would you draw the same distinction between a police officer who is not expert at detecting the smell of methamphetamine and a police officer who is expert at detecting the smell of that drug? To knock on the front door, yes. Well, don't we have to accept that? Don't we have to accept that as a statement of Florida law? Do we not have to accept that as a statement of Florida law? No? I thought the reason -- I thought the rationale in Jones, what Jones added, was that it is a search if it was a trespass. And so I come back to the very first question I asked you, do you have any authority for the proposition that this would be a trespass? Any case that says this is -- any trespass case in the last five hundred years in any English-speaking country? ",well i think your first reason be be so broad it be clearly incorrect it be so broad you ought to go on to your second reason you know we have have hundred of year of trespass case in this country and in england have there do you have a single case hold that it be a trespass for a person with a dog to walk up to the front door of a house that really be not my question be it if a dog on a leash be bring up to the front door of a person s house be that a trespass at the time when the fourth amendment be adopt what be the case that say that you do not have the case what if he go to he go to deliver the ticket and he sniff he do not intend to sniff before he go but he go the deliver the ticket and he smell the marijuana be that a search well he do exactly the same thing two officer go up to two identical house one go up with the subjective intent to sniff the other one go up with the subjective intent to drop off the ticket to the policeman s ball your answer be one be a search one be not a search i think the relevance of technology be that the technology that we have now be not necessarily be not much of it be not available at the time when the fourth amendment be adopt so we can not tell what the what people in would have think about it but that be not true of dog dog we be around they have be around for year and they have be use and they have be use to detect scent for for thousand of year certainly they we be available for that purpose in be not they but they have be train to track people have they not so in if someone if the police we be use or somebody be use a bloodhound to track someone who be suspect of a crime and the bloodhound and they use the bloodhound to track the person to the front of to the front door of a house would that have be regard as a trespass and what be the case that say that without implied consent actual or implied consent well be there case that say that the implied consent exist only where the person be come to the door for a purpose that the homeowner would approve if the homeowner know the purpose of the person come to the door so why be that why be that if you take a poll of people and say do you want do you want police officer who suspect you of possibly engage in criminal conduct to come to your front door and knock on the door so they can talk to you and attempt to get incriminating information out of you would most people say yeah i consent to that you draw a distinction between dog that be not drug detection dog and ordinary dog would you draw the same distinction between a police officer who be not expert at detect the smell of methamphetamine and a police officer who be expert at detect the smell of that drug to knock on the front door yes well do not we have to accept that do not we have to accept that as a statement of florida law do we not have to accept that as a statement of florida law no i think the reason i think the rationale in jones what jones add be that it be a search if it be a trespass and so i come back to the very first question i ask you do you have any authority for the proposition that this would be a trespass any case that say this be any trespass case in the last five hundred year in any english speaking country ,196.66,Roberts Court,"Oct 31, 2012",State of Florida,Joelis Jardines,11-564,"Jan 6, 2012","Mar 26, 2013",112,0.0,0.0,0.0,1

2012,Wos v. E.M.A. et al.,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","What if this case is tried to a verdict and there is a special verdict and the jury says that 10 percent was medical expenses? The statute would override that? What's the difference between that case and Ahlborn, where you have -- where the State has agreed that a certain amount is attributable for medical expenses, and then this hypothetical that the jury has determined that a certain amount constitutes medical expenses? What's the difference between those two? Isn't the reasoning of Ahlborn that when we know to a certainty how much the medical expenses were and what -- what part of the judgment this represents or the settlement represents medical expenses, then only that much can be assigned to the government? And I don't see the difference between that and the verdict situation. Could I ask you how often this comes up in North Carolina? Do you have any figures where you have a dispute of this nature, during the course of a year? Well, how is this allocation not happening? Well, this is what I envision happening, if the -- if the parties can't -- if the State and the -- and the recipient of the -- of Medicaid assistance can't come to an agreement. Basically, you have to make an estimate of what the damages would have been if the case had been tried and then you determine that the medical portion of the damages would have been 15 percent and so you reduce, then you take the amount of the settlement, and the amount of the settlement that is attributable to the medical expenses is 15 percent. That would be what I would envision. Is that not correct? That seems very -- that seems really very complicated. How can a judge -- where the case is settled and the judge doesn't really know anything about the proof, how is a judge going to be in a position really to do that? Could I ask you a question on this different point? Could the -- suppose the North Carolina legislature passed a statute that says something like the following: ""In any tort action in which an item of damages sought is medical expenses, the plaintiff may not recover for any other item of damages until the full amount of the medical expenses is satisfied. "" Now, then they're just restructuring their tort law. Would there be a problem with that? Does Federal law -- did Federal law require your client to seek compensation for medical expenses? So you could have -- could you have filed suit and disclaimed any -- any claim for medical expenses, you only want to be compensated for other things? ",what if this case be try to a verdict and there be a special verdict and the jury say that percent be medical expense the statute would override that what be the difference between that case and ahlborn where you have where the state have agree that a certain amount be attributable for medical expense and then this hypothetical that the jury have determine that a certain amount constitute medical expense what be the difference between those two be not the reasoning of ahlborn that when we know to a certainty how much the medical expense we be and what what part of the judgment this represent or the settlement represent medical expense then only that much can be assign to the government and i do not see the difference between that and the verdict situation could i ask you how often this come up in north carolina do you have any figure where you have a dispute of this nature during the course of a year well how be this allocation not happen well this be what i envision happening if the if the party can not if the state and the and the recipient of the of medicaid assistance can not come to an agreement basically you have to make an estimate of what the damage would have be if the case have be try and then you determine that the medical portion of the damage would have be percent and so you reduce then you take the amount of the settlement and the amount of the settlement that be attributable to the medical expense be percent that would be what i would envision be that not correct that seem very that seem really very complicate how can a judge where the case be settle and the judge do not really know anything about the proof how be a judge go to be in a position really to do that could i ask you a question on this different point could the suppose the north carolina legislature pass a statute that say something like the following in any tort action in which an item of damage seek be medical expense the plaintiff may not recover for any other item of damage until the full amount of the medical expense be satisfied now then they be just restructure their tort law would there be a problem with that do federal law do federal law require your client to seek compensation for medical expense so you could have could you have file suit and disclaim any any claim for medical expense you only want to be compensate for other thing ,145.08999999999997,Roberts Court,"Jan 8, 2013","Aldona Wos, Secretary, North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services","E.

2012,Ryan v. Gonzales,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","If there is a time limit -- if there is a time limit of six to nine months-- --at what point does it begin to run? Does it begin to run at the time when the petitioner moves for a stay, even if no effort was made prior to that to restore the petitioner to competency? No, but my question is this: Suppose that no effort has been made by counsel to provide -- to obtain treatment for the petitioner to restore the petitioner to competency prior to the point when a motion is made to stay the proceeding. The six-to month period would still begin to run at the time when the motion for the stay is made, or would it begin to run at some earlier point or some later point? Well, what happens if after 9 months mental health experts come in and they say there's a 90 percent chance of restoring the petitioner to competency in another 9 months or another three months or another month. So it's not limited to cases where the review is restricted to the record. Well, if there -- if the Court were to point to some guideline as to the maximum length, or the presumptive maximum length of a stay, what -- because that's the period within which there's a good chance in most cases of restoring a petitioner to competency -- at what point would that begin to run? Would there be any obligation to begin the treatment prior to the -- to the time when the motion for a stay is -- is filed? Could many years go by with the same attorney representing a client, and then at the very last minute -- and no effort is made to obtain treatment that would restore the petitioner to competency, and then at the very last minute, a motion for a stay is entered, and then this period of time -- 6 months, 9 months, a year, whatever it is -- would begin to run? Well, here, the motion -- when was the motion made, the motion for a competency determination and a stay? And when was that? Do you remember the date, roughly? And when was the initial habeas petition filed in district court? Of 2000? So why wasn't there -- then there was no obligation to do anything between 2000 and 2006? It was only after 6 years of being unable to communicate with him that the attorney said maybe there's a competency problem here? Well, is it your position that any time a petitioner raises an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the habeas proceeding can potentially be stayed indefinitely? Well, why isn't what you're proposing just a mechanism that will permit stays in virtually every capital case, if that's what the petitioner wants -- if that's what petitioner's counsel wants? Let's say you have a case where there is a small amount of mitigating evidence about the petitioner's childhood, but not enough to sway the sentencing authority. It's alleged that if the petitioner had been -- if the petitioner was competent, the petitioner could provide a lot more information about what went on during his childhood years; and, therefore, the proceeding has to be stayed indefinitely until the petitioner is restored to competence or he dies, as happened in Rees. What do you do with that situation? So if the district court says, well, there's a little bit here, and I can't rule out the possibility that there might be a lot more that's locked in the petitioner's mind, but he is unable to provide it because he is incompetent, then I'm going to grant a stay until he is restored to competence; and, then that would be insulated from being overturned on appeal by abuse of discretion standard; that's what you're arguing? Do you think that is consistent with AEDPA; that Congress, knowing, in particular, that a lot of district judges and a lot of court of appeals judges don't like the death penalty and will go to some length to prevent the imposition of that sentence, that we're just going to leave that all to the discretion of every individual district judge? Why can't the competency -- why can't the issue of competency at trial be resolved? You have to be competent during the habeas proceeding in order to assist in proving that he was -- that he was incompetent at the time of trial? ",if there be a time limit if there be a time limit of six to nine month at what point do it begin to run do it begin to run at the time when the petitioner move for a stay even if no effort be make prior to that to restore the petitioner to competency no but my question be this suppose that no effort have be make by counsel to provide to obtain treatment for the petitioner to restore the petitioner to competency prior to the point when a motion be make to stay the proceeding the six to month period would still begin to run at the time when the motion for the stay be make or would it begin to run at some early point or some late point well what happen if after month mental health expert come in and they say there be a percent chance of restore the petitioner to competency in another month or another three month or another month so it be not limit to case where the review be restrict to the record well if there if the court we be to point to some guideline as to the maximum length or the presumptive maximum length of a stay what because that be the period within which there be a good chance in most case of restore a petitioner to competency at what point would that begin to run would there be any obligation to begin the treatment prior to the to the time when the motion for a stay be be file could many year go by with the same attorney represent a client and then at the very last minute and no effort be make to obtain treatment that would restore the petitioner to competency and then at the very last minute a motion for a stay be enter and then this period of time month month a year whatever it be would begin to run well here the motion when be the motion make the motion for a competency determination and a stay and when be that do you remember the date roughly and when be the initial habeas petition file in district court of so why be not there then there be no obligation to do anything between and it be only after year of be unable to communicate with him that the attorney say maybe there be a competency problem here well be it your position that any time a petitioner raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim the habeas proceeding can potentially be stay indefinitely well why be not what you be propose just a mechanism that will permit stay in virtually every capital case if that be what the petitioner want if that be what petitioner s counsel want let us say you have a case where there be a small amount of mitigate evidence about the petitioner s childhood but not enough to sway the sentencing authority it be allege that if the petitioner have be if the petitioner be competent the petitioner could provide a lot more information about what go on during his childhood year and therefore the proceeding have to be stay indefinitely until the petitioner be restore to competence or he die as happen in rees what do you do with that situation so if the district court say well there be a little bit here and i can not rule out the possibility that there might be a lot more that be lock in the petitioner s mind but he be unable to provide it because he be incompetent then I be go to grant a stay until he be restore to competence and then that would be insulate from be overturn on appeal by abuse of discretion standard that be what you be argue do you think that be consistent with aedpa that congress know in particular that a lot of district judge and a lot of court of appeal judge do not like the death penalty and will go to some length to prevent the imposition of that sentence that we be just go to leave that all to the discretion of every individual district judge why can not the competency why can not the issue of competency at trial be resolve you have to be competent during the habeas proceeding in order to assist in prove that he be that he be incompetent at the time of trial ,255.58,Roberts Court,"Oct 9, 2012","Charles L.

I don't see how they get -- how you get those into the words of the statute. Suppose you have a boat, and it's tied up at the harbor here in Washington. It hasn't been moved for five years. It's indefinitely moved -- or 10 years or 20 years. But if it's capable, if you could untie it and sail it out into the river, doesn't it fall within the definition? If someone builds a replica of an historic watercraft, a Viking boat, the kind of outrigger canoes that the Polynesians used throughout the Pacific Ocean, and the purpose of this is to display it in a museum, no one has any intention whatsoever of ever putting it in the water, but it's built so that if they did, it would -- it would function just like its historic antecedent, is that a vessel? What if it was more seaworthy so that it could be towed 200 miles without suffering any damage, even if there are, you know, small waves, let's say?

2012,Standard Fire Insurance Company v. Knowles,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Is there a difference between what you're-- --Is there a difference between what you are advocating and the approach that's now taken in the General Removal Statute as it's been amended recently under 1446(c)(2)? So there as I read it, the amount demanded in the complaint is not necessarily controlling. A case can be removed even if the amount demanded in the complaint is below the jurisdictional threshold and then the defendant can prove that the real amount involved exceeds the jurisdictional threshold. Even if this case were handled on remand to the Arkansas Supreme Court exactly like a Federal class action, I don't understand how absent class members would ever be able to -- to determine whether by failing to opt out, they had compromised part of their claim. I don't see how, even if they're notified that there's a $5 million cap -- and I don't know that Rule 23 requires that, but suppose they're notified of that. They can't tell whether by remaining a member of the class their claim is going to be compromised at all. It would depend on lots of different things, including how many members are in the class after it's certified. And that's something they can't know. Under your argument, the amount that's demanded seems to be totally meaningless. Here, we are told that the real amount is only slightly above the $5 million figure, but I don't think that makes any difference. So let's say that what was -- you stipulate you are not going to get more than $5 million, but really the value of the claim is $50 million. And you say that's perfectly okay. It will be dealt with later when the case -- after the case has been remanded to the -- to the state courts. Isn't that right? So the $5 million is just -- just means nothing. In practical terms. Okay. But does that matter? We assume, I think, that the real amount is a little bit over $5 million. Suppose the real amount is 6 million or 7 million, 8 million, does it matter where along that continuum the real amount falls? Suppose this were an individual action, and the amount is -- an individual diversity action -- and the amount that is pled is under $75,000. The defendant still can remove the case and prove that the amount is really higher than that, because the practice of the State in question is to allow a recovery that is over $75,000. So why shouldn't the same approach apply here? Wouldn't it be perverse if the rule were that in an individual action where a plaintiff is simply stipulating how much he or she is demanding -- individually -- which the person can do, it's possible to look behind that number. But in a class action where the named Plaintiff is purporting to make a stipulation on behalf of absent class members as to whom the named plaintiff at that point has absolutely no authority, you can't look behind the number-- ",be there a difference between what you be be there a difference between what you be advocate and the approach that be now take in the general removal statute as it be be amend recently under c so there as i read it the amount demand in the complaint be not necessarily control a case can be remove even if the amount demand in the complaint be below the jurisdictional threshold and then the defendant can prove that the real amount involve exceed the jurisdictional threshold even if this case we be handle on remand to the arkansas supreme court exactly like a federal class action i do not understand how absent class member would ever be able to to determine whether by fail to opt out they have compromise part of their claim i do not see how even if they be notify that there be a million cap and i do not know that rule require that but suppose they be notify of that they can not tell whether by remain a member of the class their claim be go to be compromise at all it would depend on lot of different thing include how many member be in the class after it be certify and that be something they can not know under your argument the amount that be demand seem to be totally meaningless here we be tell that the real amount be only slightly above the million figure but i do not think that make any difference so let us say that what be you stipulate you be not go to get more than million but really the value of the claim be million and you say that be perfectly okay it will be deal with later when the case after the case have be remand to the to the state court be not that right so the million be just just mean nothing in practical term okay but do that matter we assume i think that the real amount be a little bit over million suppose the real amount be million or million million do it matter where along that continuum the real amount fall suppose this we be an individual action and the amount be an individual diversity action and the amount that be plead be under the defendant still can remove the case and prove that the amount be really high than that because the practice of the state in question be to allow a recovery that be over so why should not the same approach apply here would not it be perverse if the rule we be that in an individual action where a plaintiff be simply stipulate how much he or she be demand individually which the person can do it be possible to look behind that number but in a class action where the name plaintiff be purport to make a stipulation on behalf of absent class member as to whom the name plaintiff at that point have absolutely no authority you can not look behind the number ,195.75000000000003,Roberts Court,"Jan 7, 2013",The Standard Life Insurance Co.,Greg Knowles,11-1450,"Aug 31, 2012","Mar 19, 2013",112,1.0,1.0,1.0,1

2012,Descamps v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, the California Supreme Court has said that an element of the burglary statute is the violation of some possessory interest. Now, I know there is some disagreement between you and the government about that. But assuming for the sake of argument that that is an element, one way for the California court to express that is to say simply, as it has, that an element is the violation of the possessory interest. Another way of saying exactly the same thing would be to say that the term “ enters ” under the California burglary statute means either breaking into a structure or the violation of the possessory interest in some other way. Those are exactly equivalent. Now, if they were to say the latter, would a conviction under this statute potentially qualify under the Armed Career Criminal Act? No, but they -- they set out alternative elements, either breaking into the structure or the violation of the possessory interest in some other way. But they have said -- do you dispute the fact that saying A, an element is the violation of the possessory interest, and B, the elements are breaking or the violation of the possessory interest in same other way, are exactly the same substantively? I thought your argument was that if the terms of the statute set out alternative ways of satisfying an element, you have alternative elements in essence, that then, even if some of those alternatives don't fall within generic burglary, if one does, then a conviction under that statute potentially can qualify. Isn't that-- --Okay. Okay. Now, what if the State Supreme Court says exactly the same thing? Your answer to Justice Ginsburg was it doesn't matter whether the elements are set out in the statute or whether they are defined by the State court. Well, I'll ask the question one more time. Is there a difference -- what the California court has said is that an element is the violation of a possessory interest. Assuming for the sake of argument that is correct, that is a correct statement of California law, is there any substantive difference between saying that and saying the element is breaking or, in the alternative, the violation of a possessory interest in some other way? Is there some substantive difference between those two things? But your argument comes back to how the elements are defined. It comes back -- so in your view, what is critical is in a case of a broad statute -- whether the statute simply sets out a broad category or whether it sets out lots of subcategories, that's what your argument comes down to. If the court says -- if the California legislature or the California court says, the element is entry, period, that's one thing. If they say the element is breaking or entering in some other way, that's something entirely different. It all comes down to that, in your view. Well, if that's your argument, then you're really asking for us to modify our prior cases. Because I thought it was clear, that if the element -- if the statute requires -- that to qualify under ACCA, you have to have a gun. And the statute says that you have to have a weapon, and a weapon is defined as a gun, a knife, or a hatchet, that would be okay. Is that wrong? Isn't that your -- don't you agree with that? So your answer to Justice Breyer was not yes; it was no. What seems to me perhaps clearest about this case and others is that this modified categorical approach has turned out to be extremely complicated, and occasionally produces results that seem to make no sense whatsoever. Is this inevitable? Is this really what Congress intended, or did the Court create this problem by the way it has interpreted ACCA? Well, does the offense of burglary have the element of using force or threatening to use of force? So the element doesn't -- the element language doesn't apply to burglary. ",well the california supreme court have say that an element of the burglary statute be the violation of some possessory interest now i know there be some disagreement between you and the government about that but assume for the sake of argument that that be an element one way for the california court to express that be to say simply as it have that an element be the violation of the possessory interest another way of say exactly the same thing would be to say that the term enter under the california burglary statute mean either break into a structure or the violation of the possessory interest in some other way those be exactly equivalent now if they we be to say the latter would a conviction under this statute potentially qualify under the arm career criminal act no but they they set out alternative element either break into the structure or the violation of the possessory interest in some other way but they have say do you dispute the fact that say a an element be the violation of the possessory interest and b the element be break or the violation of the possessory interest in same other way be exactly the same substantively i think your argument be that if the term of the statute set out alternative way of satisfy an element you have alternative element in essence that then even if some of those alternative do not fall within generic burglary if one do then a conviction under that statute potentially can qualify be not that okay okay now what if the state supreme court say exactly the same thing your answer to justice ginsburg be it do not matter whether the element be set out in the statute or whether they be define by the state court well I will ask the question one more time be there a difference what the california court have say be that an element be the violation of a possessory interest assume for the sake of argument that be correct that be a correct statement of california law be there any substantive difference between say that and say the element be break or in the alternative the violation of a possessory interest in some other way be there some substantive difference between those two thing but your argument come back to how the element be define it come back so in your view what be critical be in a case of a broad statute whether the statute simply set out a broad category or whether it set out lot of subcategories that be what your argument come down to if the court say if the california legislature or the california court say the element be entry period that be one thing if they say the element be break or enter in some other way that be something entirely different it all come down to that in your view well if that be your argument then you be really ask for us to modify our prior case because i think it be clear that if the element if the statute require that to qualify under acca you have to have a gun and the statute say that you have to have a weapon and a weapon be define as a gun a knife or a hatchet that would be okay be that wrong be not that your do not you agree with that so your answer to justice breyer be not yes it be no what seem to me perhaps clearest about this case and others be that this modified categorical approach have turn out to be extremely complicate and occasionally produce result that seem to make no sense whatsoever be this inevitable be this really what congress intend or do the court create this problem by the way it have interpret acca well do the offense of burglary have the element of use force or threaten to use of force so the element do not the element language do not apply to burglary ,251.69,Roberts Court,"Jan 7, 2013",Matthew R.

2012,United States v. Kebodeaux,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, we start out with the power under the Constitution to make rules to regulate the military and we end up with a registration requirement that applies to someone who's not in the military and perhaps is not even living anywhere near any military installation. So what would be helpful for me is to start out with the constitutional provision, identify a purpose of that that is served by this civil registration that is imposed later, and trace this whole progress through the Necessary and Proper Clause. Yes. When you say in a civil proceeding, you mean? We are not talking -- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt your question. We're not talking about statutory authorization. We are talking about constitutional power. So if we start out with the example of registration for life being imposed as part of supervised release, part of the criminal sentence, then we go to an example where it is not part of the criminal sentence but it is a civil requirement triggered by a separate civil proceeding for every Federal -- every person convicted of a sex offense under Federal law. Now, if that were the setup statutorily, would that fall within Congress's power under Article I? Well, we know what -- and we know what power they are relying on. Let's just look at the power that they're relying on here: It's the power to make rules for the regulation of the military. So part of their -- in the exercise of their power to make rules for the regulation of the military, they impose a civil sex offender registration requirement for someone convicted of a sex offense under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. That does not, in your judgment, fall within Article I? Well, let me -- let me try this chain of reasoning out on you and -- and get your reaction. We're starting out with the power of Congress to make rules for the regulation of the military. And one of the things that they want to do in making those rules is to make military installations acceptable to the local communities where they are located. They know from experience, for example, it's happened in Okinawa, that when have you military personnel who go -- who commit sex offenses with people off base, it can cause tremendous opposition. And this is what happened here; not the opposition, but an offense involving a 15-year-old girl who lived off the base. So in order to ensure that there -- we don't have excessive civilian opposition to the location of military bases, we are going to do a number of things. One thing is we're going to criminally prosecute members of the military who commit these offenses. This will deter; this will incapacitate. But also, to provide further assurance to the community that these people are not going to be dangerous, we are going to require them to register. Now, maybe that's too attenuated, but I'd like to get your reaction. Why could Congress not do that under the Necessary and Proper Clause? Is it your argument that Congress lacks the power to impose supervised release after the date when the person leaves the military? Someone is sentenced to prison-- --under the UCMJ, released, dishonorably discharged from the military. Can Congress say the person has to remain on supervised release for a longer period of time after he is returned to civilian status? See, I understand -- I can understand why that might create -- that might raise all sorts of constitutional arguments about notice and so forth. But I don't see how that -- how that connects with the question whether Congress has the power to do it under -- under Article I-- --under the power to regulate the military. Well, you could be making the argument that the power to make rules for the military applies only to people who are in the military, and that once you're out of the military that power does not permit Congress to do anything special to you. But you're not making that argument, I gather. ",well we start out with the power under the constitution to make rule to regulate the military and we end up with a registration requirement that apply to someone who be not in the military and perhaps be not even live anywhere near any military installation so what would be helpful for me be to start out with the constitutional provision identify a purpose of that that be serve by this civil registration that be impose later and trace this whole progress through the necessary and proper clause yes when you say in a civil proceeding you mean we be not talk I be sorry i do not mean to interrupt your question we be not talk about statutory authorization we be talk about constitutional power so if we start out with the example of registration for life be impose as part of supervised release part of the criminal sentence then we go to an example where it be not part of the criminal sentence but it be a civil requirement trigger by a separate civil proceeding for every federal every person convict of a sex offense under federal law now if that we be the setup statutorily would that fall within congress s power under article i well we know what and we know what power they be rely on let us just look at the power that they be rely on here it be the power to make rule for the regulation of the military so part of their in the exercise of their power to make rule for the regulation of the military they impose a civil sex offender registration requirement for someone convict of a sex offense under the uniform code of military justice that do not in your judgment fall within article i well let me let me try this chain of reason out on you and and get your reaction we be start out with the power of congress to make rule for the regulation of the military and one of the thing that they want to do in make those rule be to make military installation acceptable to the local community where they be locate they know from experience for example it be happen in okinawa that when have you military personnel who go who commit sex offense with people off base it can because tremendous opposition and this be what happen here not the opposition but an offense involve a year old girl who live off the base so in order to ensure that there we do not have excessive civilian opposition to the location of military base we be go to do a number of thing one thing be we be go to criminally prosecute member of the military who commit these offense this will deter this will incapacitate but also to provide further assurance to the community that these people be not go to be dangerous we be go to require them to register now maybe that be too attenuated but I would like to get your reaction why could congress not do that under the necessary and proper clause be it your argument that congress lack the power to impose supervised release after the date when the person leave the military someone be sentence to prison under the ucmj release dishonorably discharge from the military can congress say the person have to remain on supervised release for a long period of time after he be return to civilian status see i understand i can understand why that might create that might raise all sort of constitutional argument about notice and so forth but i do not see how that how that connect with the question whether congress have the power to do it under under article i under the power to regulate the military well you could be make the argument that the power to make rule for the military applies only to people who be in the military and that once you be out of the military that power do not permit congress to do anything special to you but you be not make that argument i gather ,245.17999999999995,Roberts Court,"Apr 17, 2013",United States,Anthony James Kebodeaux,12-418,"Jan 11, 2013","Jun 24, 2013",112,1.0,1.0,0.0,1

2012,Hillman v. Maretta,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","If an insured, after making a designation of a beneficiary, writes a will and leaves the insurance proceeds to a different person, the Federal law would still, as interpreted by the State Supreme Court, require the money to be paid to the designated beneficiary, wouldn't it? And what does that say about Congress's supposed desire to ensure that the money goes to the person that the insured wants it to go to? Well, the point is if Congress's objective, if one of its objectives in addition to administrative convenience was to effectuate the will of the insured, then I don't see why it would provide for Federal law to override a subsequent will which directly expresses the desire of the insured. Well, my problem with this case is, other than administrative convenience, I don't see what purpose Congress could have thought that this provision serves. What else -- what other -- what other objective do you think Congress was trying to achieve? Why would it override the expressed will of an insured in -- the express desire of an insured in, for example, a will that's executed after the time of the assignment-- --and the designation of the beneficiary. But why? You've got a -- you've got a designation of the beneficiary in 1975, let's say, and then you have a will that's executed in 2005. Why would Congress want the -- the designation of the beneficiary so far in the past to override the expression of the desire of the insured in the subsequent will? How can that be the best designation of intent? You have a designation long in the past, then you have a will that says that: The insurance proceeds I'm leaving to a different person. How is the earlier designation of a beneficiary a better expression of intent? Well, that provides a simple -- that provides a -- a simple rule for the people who are affected by this dispute, and those are the people who are -- who stand to benefit either under the designation of the beneficiary or under the will. But what -- why does Congress care about that? There are a lot of messy domestic relations issues out there in the States. That's what Congress was doing? They said, you know, these -- that State domestic relations law leads to a lot of nasty and difficult disputes -- you know, Bleak House. Let's intervene and let's simplify this with a simple rule. Do you think that's what was involved here. Well, why would Congress want to make sure that the money goes to the designated beneficiary where there is a very clear expression of intent on the part of the insured that the money go someplace else. These arguments seem to be circular. You're saying that the -- the reason for making sure that the designated beneficiary gets the money instead of the person whom the insured has subsequently and very clearly said he or she wants to get the money is to make sure that the designated beneficiary gets the money, and gets it without any hassle. When are they told -- when are they told over and over again? They -- they get the form when they -- when they sign up for the life insurance, so they periodically get notices from OPM saying, now, remember, you've designated so-and-so as your beneficiary, you know, annually, like in the open season? Do you really want to keep this person as your beneficiary? Nobody has told me that in many years. [Laughter] Do you think that situation comes up a lot, where an -- an insured wants to make sure that a former spouse gets more money than the spouse is entitled to under the divorce decree? Well, everything is possible. Do you think that's a common situation; that's what Congress was-- --was concerned about? ",if an insured after make a designation of a beneficiary write a will and leave the insurance proceeds to a different person the federal law would still as interpret by the state supreme court require the money to be pay to the designate beneficiary would not it and what do that say about congress s suppose desire to ensure that the money go to the person that the insured want it to go to well the point be if congress s objective if one of its objective in addition to administrative convenience be to effectuate the will of the insured then i do not see why it would provide for federal law to override a subsequent will which directly express the desire of the insured well my problem with this case be other than administrative convenience i do not see what purpose congress could have think that this provision serve what else what other what other objective do you think congress be try to achieve why would it override the express will of an insure in the express desire of an insured in for example a will that be execute after the time of the assignment and the designation of the beneficiary but why you have get a you have get a designation of the beneficiary in let us say and then you have a will that be execute in why would congress want the the designation of the beneficiary so far in the past to override the expression of the desire of the insure in the subsequent will how can that be the best designation of intent you have a designation long in the past then you have a will that say that the insurance proceeds I be leave to a different person how be the early designation of a beneficiary a good expression of intent well that provide a simple that provide a a simple rule for the people who be affect by this dispute and those be the people who be who stand to benefit either under the designation of the beneficiary or under the will but what why do congress care about that there be a lot of messy domestic relation issue out there in the state that be what congress be do they say you know these that state domestic relation law lead to a lot of nasty and difficult dispute you know bleak house let us intervene and let us simplify this with a simple rule do you think that be what be involve here well why would congress want to make sure that the money go to the designate beneficiary where there be a very clear expression of intent on the part of the insured that the money go someplace else these argument seem to be circular you be say that the the reason for make sure that the designated beneficiary get the money instead of the person whom the insured have subsequently and very clearly say he or she want to get the money be to make sure that the designated beneficiary get the money and get it without any hassle when be they tell when be they tell over and over again they they get the form when they when they sign up for the life insurance so they periodically get notice from opm say now remember you have designate so and so as your beneficiary you know annually like in the open season do you really want to keep this person as your beneficiary nobody have tell me that in many year laughter do you think that situation come up a lot where an an insured want to make sure that a former spouse get more money than the spouse be entitle to under the divorce decree well everything be possible do you think that be a common situation that be what congress be be concern about ,231.39,Roberts Court,"Apr 22, 2013",Jacqueline Hillman,Judy A.

2012,Metrish v. Lancaster,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, we don't -- well, we don't really have to reach this issue in this case, according to your submission, but what would happen if a State -- an intermediate State appellate court said the law is such-and-such, and then a -- a person is tried in the interim, is tried and subsequently, the State supreme court says that intermediate State court decision was incorrect, that never was the law of this State; the law was exactly the opposite. Well, what I'm wondering is how we even get beyond the statement, the holding by a State supreme court regarding the -- the law of the State. Don't we have to accept that as the -- as the law of the State? Isn't that what our decision in Fiore says? If the State supreme court says this is the law and it's always been the law, then how can we second-guess that? In Griffin -- you describe Griffin in your brief as follows: ""The court vacated, reversed, and remanded the decision below based on. "" quote, ""defendant's claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to explore defenses of diminished capacity and insanity. "" “ And insanity ”. So it wasn't specifically -- wasn't limited to diminished capacity. It was insanity in general. Well, what is the unfairness-- --What is the unfairness here? Do you think there's a reliance? What is the -- so what is the unfairness here? I -- I don't see how the question can be whether there was a change in Michigan law, because we can't second-guess the Michigan Supreme Court about what Michigan law was. Michigan law is whatever the State supreme court says it was. We might agree, we might disagree. So I think we have to start from the proposition that the law didn't change, because that's what the Michigan Supreme Court said. So there must be some other ex post facto principle that applies when there's a certain type of unfairness. And I wonder if you could articulate what that principle is. Well, I think you're -- what you're arguing is that under certain -- in evaluating certain constitutional claims, the -- the question of what State law is is not dispositive. I don't think you're arguing that a Federal court has a right to tell a State court what State law is. Well, I mean, suppose this were a diversity case. Can -- can a Federal court say, you know, we -- we think that the -- the decisions of the intermediate State supreme court were correct and this new decision by the State supreme court is incorrect, so we're not going to follow that? It's not -- it's not this case, because there, you're trying to figure out what State law is. Here you're applying a constitutional principle. So what is that -- that gets me to the second part of my question. What is the -- the constitutional principle that doesn't depend on what State law was? This is -- this is the due process issue, right? So why is it unfair? Why is there an entitlement under due process to assert what appears under the law of the State's intermediate court decisions to be a valid defense, but is later determined never to have been or not to have been at the time a valid defense? What is the unfairness involved there?

2012,Fisher v. University of Texas,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Mr. Rein, do you understand what the University of Texas thinks is the definition of a critical mass? Because I don't. Well, on the classroom diversity, how does the non-Top 10 Percent part of the plan further classroom diversity? My understanding is that the university had over 5,000 classes that qualified as small and the total number of African Americans and Hispanics who were admitted under the part of the plan that is challenged was just a little over 200. So how does that -- how does that -- how can that possibly do more than a tiny, tiny amount to increase classroom diversity? Per class? Individuals in class. How many -- how many non-Top 10 Percent members of the two minorities at issue here are admitted in each class? I really don't understand your answer. You know the total number of, let's say, African Americans in an entering class, right? Yes or no? And you know the total number who were admitted under the Top 10 Percent Plan? If you subtract A from B you'll get C, right? And what is the value of C per class? Does critical mass vary from group to group? Does it vary from State to State? But could you answer my question? What does the University of Texas -- the University of Texas think about those questions? Is the critical mass for the University of Texas dependent on the breakdown of the population of Texas? It's not. Well, I thought that the whole purpose of affirmative action was to help students who come from underprivileged backgrounds, but you make a very different argument that I don't think I've ever seen before. The top 10 percent plan admits lots of African Americans -- lots of Hispanics and a fair number of African Americans. But you say, well, it's -- it's faulty, because it doesn't admit enough African Americans and Hispanics who come from privileged backgrounds. And you specifically have the example of the child of successful professionals in Dallas. Now, that's your argument? If you have -- you have an applicant whose parents are -- let's say they're -- one of them is a partner in your law firm in Texas, another one is a part -- is another corporate lawyer. They have income that puts them in the top 1 percent of earners in the country, and they have -- parents both have graduate degrees. They deserve a leg-up against, let's say, an Asian or a white applicant whose parents are absolutely average in terms of education and income? Well, how can the answer to that question be no, because being an African American or being a Hispanic is a plus factor. But would 3 percent be enough in New Mexico, your bordering state, where the African American population is around 2 percent? Well, in terms of diversity, how do you justify lumping together all Asian Americans? Do you think -- do you have a critical mass of Filipino Americans? Cambodian Americans-- --Cambodian Americans? But do you have a critical mass as to all the subgroups that fall within this enormous group of Asian Americans? Does the United States agree with Mr. Garre that African American and Hispanic applicants from privileged backgrounds deserve a preference? If you have two applicants who are absolutely the same in every respect: They both come from affluent backgrounds, well-educated parents. One falls within two of the groups that are given a preference, the other doesn't. It's a marginal case. It's the last -- the last position available in the class. Under the Texas plan, one gets in; one doesn't get in. Now, do you agree with that or not? Do you agree with -- do you agree that that is an incorrect statement of the facts, or do you agree that that's an incorrect understanding of the Equal Protection Clause? Let me withdraw that hypothetical if you don't like that. Before your time runs out, let me ask you another question. Your ROTC argument -- you make -- you make -- you devote a lot of attention in your brief to the military. Could you explain your ROTC argument to me? Why is it important for the ROTC program for commissioned officers that Texas have this other plan on top of the top 10 percent plan? Oh, I understand that. And just -- I don't want to cut you off, but-- --because the time is about to expire, so you've got a marginal candidate who wants to go to the University of Texas at Austin and is also interested in ROTC. Maybe if race is taken into account, the candidate gets in. Maybe if it isn't, he doesn't get in. How does that impact the military? The candidate will then probably go to Texas A&M or Texas Tech? Is it your position that he will be an inferior military officer if he went to one of those schools? Then I don't understand the argument. ",mr rein do you understand what the university of texas think be the definition of a critical mass because i do not well on the classroom diversity how do the non top percent part of the plan further classroom diversity my understanding be that the university have over class that qualify as small and the total number of african american and hispanic who we be admit under the part of the plan that be challenge be just a little over so how do that how do that how can that possibly do more than a tiny tiny amount to increase classroom diversity per class individual in class how many how many non top percent member of the two minority at issue here be admit in each class i really do not understand your answer you know the total number of let us say african american in an entering class right yes or no and you know the total number who we be admit under the top percent plan if you subtract a from b you will get c right and what be the value of c per class do critical mass vary from group to group do it vary from state to state but could you answer my question what do the university of texas the university of texas think about those question be the critical mass for the university of texas dependent on the breakdown of the population of texas it be not well i think that the whole purpose of affirmative action be to help student who come from underprivileged background but you make a very different argument that i do not think I have ever see before the top percent plan admit lot of african american lot of hispanic and a fair number of african american but you say well it be it be faulty because it do not admit enough african american and hispanic who come from privilege background and you specifically have the example of the child of successful professional in dallas now that be your argument if you have you have an applicant whose parent be let us say they be one of them be a partner in your law firm in texas another one be a part be another corporate lawyer they have income that put them in the top percent of earner in the country and they have parent both have graduate degree they deserve a leg up against let us say an asian or a white applicant whose parent be absolutely average in term of education and income well how can the answer to that question be no because be an african american or be a hispanic be a plus factor but would percent be enough in new mexico your border state where the african american population be around percent well in term of diversity how do you justify lump together all asian american do you think do you have a critical mass of filipino american cambodian american cambodian american but do you have a critical mass as to all the subgroup that fall within this enormous group of asian american do the united state agree with mr garre that african american and hispanic applicant from privileged background deserve a preference if you have two applicant who be absolutely the same in every respect they both come from affluent background well educate parent one fall within two of the group that be give a preference the other do not it be a marginal case it be the last the last position available in the class under the texas plan one get in one do not get in now do you agree with that or not do you agree with do you agree that that be an incorrect statement of the fact or do you agree that that be an incorrect understanding of the equal protection clause let me withdraw that hypothetical if you do not like that before your time run out let me ask you another question your rotc argument you make you make you devote a lot of attention in your brief to the military could you explain your rotc argument to me why be it important for the rotc program for commissioned officer that texas have this other plan on top of the top percent plan oh i understand that and just i do not want to cut you off but because the time be about to expire so you have get a marginal candidate who want to go to the university of texas at austin and be also interested in rotc maybe if race be take into account the candidate get in maybe if it be not he do not get in how do that impact the military the candidate will then probably go to texas a m or texas tech be it your position that he will be an inferior military officer if he go to one of those school then i do not understand the argument ,268.85,Roberts Court,"Oct 10, 2012",Abigail N.

2012,Peugh v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, let's say you prevail and the case is remanded for resentencing. Is there anything that would prevent the district court from saying, you know, before the promulgation of the new guidelines, I thought the range in the old guidelines was about right for this offense. But now that I've seen the new guidelines, I think that those really fit best under the factors that I have to consider under the statute in determining the correct sentence, so I'm going to reimpose exactly the same sentence. Not because it's required by the guidelines, in fact, I'm going to go outside the guidelines. I just think, with the enlightenment that the new guidelines have provided me, that that's the best sentence. Would that be -- would there be an ex post facto problem there? What if the -- what if the statistics showed that nationwide only, let's say, 25 percent of defendants were being sentenced within the guideline range; would that change your argument? Well, I think there's a fair chance that as time goes by-- --we're going to see fewer and fewer sentences within the guidelines. As judges who began their careers during the guidelines, the mandatory guidelines era, leave the bench, new judges come in who never had to deal with the mandatory guidelines, I think we're going to see fewer and fewer guidelines sentences. And -- and the percentages in some districts are -- are really quite striking. I'm told that in the Southern District -- or the Eastern District of New York now, only 30 percent of the defendants receive within-guidelines sentences.

2012,Trevino v. Thaler,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, I have the same questions that my colleagues have asked. Could you give us in a sentence or two the test that you would like us to apply? Where a State does not, like Arizona, prohibit the raising of this issue on direct appeal, Martinez nevertheless applies where the State does -- blank. Fill in the blank. Impracticable in the vast majority of cases. Now, that really would require a case-by-case determination in every other State that doesn't fall within the Martinez category, wouldn't it? No? Well, I understand that. But -- so -- so the State says you have to raise this on direct appeal, but you have to comply with our time limits on direct appeal. And they don't appoint -- you know, you don't get a new attorney on direct appeal. It's the same attorney who represented you at trial. So that attorney is in the position of arguing that he or she was ineffective at trial, and that would be okay? You have to raise it on direct appeal or it's lost. You can't wait until collateral -- until the collateral proceeding. And by the way, you don't get a new attorney. You get the same attorney that represented you at trial. Would that be all right? So you have the same system where you get a new attorney but you have to comply with the time limits-- --and then you say, well, I can't do all of this social background research that Wiggins requires within the time limits, so that's impracticable. Is that State okay? That's not okay either. So the reason why -- the reason why there was a movement to channel ineffective assistance of counsel claims to collateral review is that it is often, maybe in the great majority of cases, impracticable to adjudicate them on direct appeal. So under your standard, it seems to me that covers every State. Well, let me try this one more time. You seem to say in your brief that the Kansas procedure and the -- the Michigan procedure take those States outside of the Martinez category; is that correct? All right. Now, as I understand the procedure in those cases, it is the following: On direct appeal, the attorney can make a motion for a new trial based on ineffective assistance of counsel and if some threshold is met, the appellate court can remand the case to the trial court for a hearing on ineffective assistance. Is that correct? Okay. And that would -- in most of those cases, the attorney on direct appeal is going to be the attorney who represented the defendant at trial and is probably not going to be in a very good position to argue that he or she was ineffective at trial. But that would still be okay. And if you don't do that, you've lost it. That was a case in which -- that was the case in which the Court unwisely reversed a certain Third Circuit decision. [Laughter] The Respondent says that the Kansas and the Michigan procedures are sufficient to take the case -- to take those States outside of Martinez. You say your stay and abate proceeding is the same, essentially, as those procedures. His response is that Texas has used this remedy in only one situation, and that is when a defendant is deprived of counsel during the new trial window and suffers prejudice from the deprivation. Now is that correct? ",well i have the same question that my colleague have ask could you give us in a sentence or two the test that you would like us to apply where a state do not like arizona prohibit the raising of this issue on direct appeal martinez nevertheless apply where the state do blank fill in the blank impracticable in the vast majority of case now that really would require a case by case determination in every other state that do not fall within the martinez category would not it no well i understand that but so so the state say you have to raise this on direct appeal but you have to comply with our time limit on direct appeal and they do not appoint you know you do not get a new attorney on direct appeal it be the same attorney who represent you at trial so that attorney be in the position of argue that he or she be ineffective at trial and that would be okay you have to raise it on direct appeal or it be lose you can not wait until collateral until the collateral proceeding and by the way you do not get a new attorney you get the same attorney that represent you at trial would that be all right so you have the same system where you get a new attorney but you have to comply with the time limit and then you say well i can not do all of this social background research that wiggins require within the time limit so that be impracticable be that state okay that be not okay either so the reason why the reason why there be a movement to channel ineffective assistance of counsel claim to collateral review be that it be often maybe in the great majority of case impracticable to adjudicate them on direct appeal so under your standard it seem to me that cover every state well let me try this one more time you seem to say in your brief that the kansas procedure and the the michigan procedure take those state outside of the martinez category be that correct all right now as i understand the procedure in those case it be the following on direct appeal the attorney can make a motion for a new trial base on ineffective assistance of counsel and if some threshold be meet the appellate court can remand the case to the trial court for a hearing on ineffective assistance be that correct okay and that would in most of those case the attorney on direct appeal be go to be the attorney who represent the defendant at trial and be probably not go to be in a very good position to argue that he or she be ineffective at trial but that would still be okay and if you do not do that you have lose it that be a case in which that be the case in which the court unwisely reverse a certain third circuit decision laughter the respondent say that the kansa and the michigan procedure be sufficient to take the case to take those state outside of martinez you say your stay and abate proceeding be the same essentially as those procedure his response be that texas have use this remedy in only one situation and that be when a defendant be deprive of counsel during the new trial window and suffers prejudice from the deprivation now be that correct ,196.69,Roberts Court,"Feb 25, 2013",Carlos Trevino,"Rick Thaler, Director, Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Correctional Institutions Division",11-10189,"Oct 29, 2012","May 28, 2013",112,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

The first is the case in which the petition is timely filed and -- as you see it, but the claimant does not prevail because the claimant is unable to prove that the injury was caused by the vaccine, but there was a reasonable basis for the argument and the argument was made in good faith, so there would be eligibility for attorneys' fees. The second is a case in which there is a question about when the statute of limitations begins to run. And one of the points at which it can begin to run is when there is the onset of significant aggravation of an injury, which seems like a question about which there could be a factual dispute. And in that situation as well, the claimant does not prevail on the statute of limitations argument, but there was a reasonable basis for thinking that the petition was submitted within the period after the -- the onset of this significant aggravation. Why would Congress want to draw a line between -- a distinction between those two situations for the purpose of attorneys' fees? And if there is a hearing, would the claimant's attorney get -- potentially get attorneys' fees for the representation at the hearing about attorneys' fees? This may be a question that the Government is in a better position to answer, but do -- do you have any sense of how often claims are rejected on the ground of timeliness, what we're dealing with? I mean, you mentioned in a footnote that the fund out of which the -- the claims and the attorneys' fees are paid has a positive balance of $3.5 billion.

And let's say that tax is challenged by somebody whose last name begins with A. Would it be a defense to that challenge that for some reason this particular person really should pay a $1,000 penalty that people with a different last name do not pay? Well, there's no question that-- --There's no question-- --There is no question that the Voting Rights Act has done enormous good. It's one of the most successful statutes that Congress passed in the twentieth century and one could probably go farther than that. But when Congress decided to reauthorize it in 2006, why wasn't it incumbent on Congress under the congruence and proportionality standard to make a new determination of coverage? Maybe the whole country should be covered. Or maybe certain parts of the country should be covered based on a formula that is grounded in up-to-date statistics. But why -- why wasn't that required by the congruence and proportionality standards? Suppose that Congress in 1965 had based the coverage formula on voting statistics from 1919, 46 years earlier. Do you think Katzenbach would have come out the same way? Then why shouldn't it apply everywhere in the country? Well, you do really think there was -- that the record in 2006 supports the proposition that -- let's just take the question of changing the location of polling places. That's a bigger problem in Virginia than in Tennessee, or it's a bigger problem in Arizona than Nevada, or in the Bronx as opposed to Brooklyn. Well, the statistics that I have before me show that in, let's say the 5 years prior to reauthorization, the gap between success in Section 2 suits in the covered and the non-covered jurisdiction narrowed and eventually was eliminated. Do you disagree with that? Before your time expires, I would like to make sure I understand your position on this as-applied versus facial issue. Is it your position that this would be a different case if it were brought by, let's say, a county in Alaska as opposed to Shelby County, Alabama?

You have a person who is in a situation where there is a certain risk, a certain degree of risk of -- of the person's conversation being intercepted, but it's not certainly impending. So then the person simply takes some preventative measures, and acquires standing that wouldn't otherwise be present. Could I go back to a question that Justice Breyer asked, where he used the analogy of a lawyer who is representing someone who is alleged to be an organized crime figure. Suppose you have a case where a lawyer says, I represent so and so, the government thinks this person is an organized crime kingpin, I know the government has a very extensive wiretapping program for people who fall into this category, I want to raise -- I want to challenge the constitutionality of the statute under which some of this wiretapping occurs. Would that person have stand -- would that lawyer have standing? Do you know of any case that holds that? The Federal wiretapping statute has been around for 40 years. Has there been a single case that falls into this category that you're talking about? Well, there is a notice provision under this statute. Isn't what you just suggested as a way of resolving this case rather bizarre? Someone who is -- whom the Government believes to be a top terrorist and a great threat to the country can stop the use of this surveillance by hiring an American lawyer and then having the American lawyer come into court and say -- you know, challenge the constitutionality of this, and the way to resolve the case would be for the Government to go into court and say: Well, we're not going to -- we're not going to target this -- this person whom we believe to be a great security threat? But in Monsanto, suppose the challenge had been brought by a soybean farmer who said, ""I raise soybeans and people around me raise soybeans, I'm afraid that they're going to start planting genetically modified soybeans, but they haven't done it up to this point, but, you know, this might be something they will do in the future and if they do that, then I'm going to have to take precautions.

2013,Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Is that an accurate description of Seattle? I thought that in Seattle, before the school board adopted the bussing plan, the city was threatened with lawsuits by the Department of Justice, by the Federal government, and by private plaintiffs, claiming that the -- the previous pupil assignment plan was -- involved de jure segregation. Isn't that -- isn't that correct? I don't understand the answer to that question. As to Seattle itself, is it not the case that they were threatened with litigation? And isn't it correct that the district court found that there was de jure segregation? It didn't? Well, I thought the whole purpose of strict scrutiny was to say that if you want to talk about race, you have a much higher hurdle to climb than if you want to talk about something else. Now, you can argue that strict scrutiny should only apply to minorities and not to students who are not minorities, but I thought the Court decided that a long time ago. So I don't know why that's a hard question that you asked about the student who says, I want to talk about race. What if it's a white student who comes in and says: I want to talk about race; I'm white and therefore you should admit me, you should give me preference. The State can't say, no, we don't want to hear that? Well, I don't understand your answer then. If the student -- one student comes in and says I want to talk about how well I play the cello, all right, we'll listen to that. I want to come in and talk about why I as a white person should get a preference; you have to listen to that because you're listening to the -- to the talk about the cello, too? If Proposal 2 had been in the Michigan Constitution before any affirmative action program was adopted, would the result be the same? Can I -- can I come back to the question that the Chief Justice and Justice Kennedy were asking before? Essentially, it's their question. Let's say that the -- the decision about admissions criteria across the board is basically delegated to the faculty. All right? And the faculty adopts some sort of affirmative action plan. And now that is overruled in favor of a colorblind approach at various levels going up the ladder. So maybe it's overruled by the -- the dean of -- by a dean, or maybe it's overruled by the president of the university. Maybe it's overruled by the regents. Maybe, if State laws allowed, it's -- it's overruled by an executive department of the State. Maybe it's overruled by the legislature through ordinary legislation. Maybe it's overruled through a constitutional amendment. At what point does the political restructuring doctrine kick in? Well, that really -- that really isn't responsive to my question. Let's say exactly what was done here is done at all of these levels. At what point does the doctrine kick in? When it goes from the faculty to the dean? From the dean to the president, et cetera, et cetera? Where does this apply? But would that be true -- I'm sorry. Would that be true if they had never gotten involved in admissions criteria before? They have the authority, but they left that to the university officials. I don't see how that is consistent with Justice Sotomayor's answer to my question. Don't the people of Michigan have -- don't the people of Michigan have plenary authority? Seattle and this case both involve constitutional -- Seattle and this case both involve constitutional amendments. So why can't the law -- the law be drawn -- the line be drawn there? If you change the allocation of power in one of these less substantial ways, that's one thing; but when you require a constitutional amendment that's really a big deal.

So if your -- if your client or another tribe just decided to go into the gaming business all over the country and began opening casinos in places that clearly are not Indian lands, you still would have sovereign immunity. What remedy-- --What remedy would a private person have? Suppose a patron of a casino was beaten up by casino employees. What remedy could that person have? What about -- what about private individuals who may have a claim against -- as a result of the operation of the casino? Vendors who want to be paid, somebody who slips and falls. That's all barred by sovereign immunity?

2013,Lexmark International v. Static Control Components,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","I -- I assume you would agree that the manufacturer of the cartridges that compete with Lexmark would have standing here. But it's not a very big step from the manufacturer of the cartridge that competes to the manufacturer of the chip, which is really the essential component of -- or an essential component of the cartridge that competes. Well, maybe the answer is when we just can't believe that Congress really meant the literal words of the statute to be interpreted without some limiting principle. So here, Congress says ‶ any person ″ and any person surely includes people who purchase printer cartridges. So if we don't think that -- that Congress really meant for every single person who purchases a printer cartridge to be able to file a claim in Federal court with no amount in controversy requirement, then that would be a situation where some consideration of prudential standing would have to take place. Suppose the comments in this case only disparaged the cartridges themselves and not the chips. Then would the chip manufacturer, would your client have standing? Well, that may be true, but I don't understand how you get from the zone of interest to the limiting principle that you are suggesting, which is that the zone of interest includes only those businesses, other than the direct competitor, whose products are targeted by the false statements. All right. Well, to change it, suppose the statements don't implicitly, even implicitly, target Static Control, but the effect of the statements is to drive Static Control out of business. You would say there would be no standing there? All right. So in Justice Breyer's hypothetical about the soda fountain that sells ice cream with chocolate sauce and there is a statement that the chocolate sauce is poisonous, if the effect of that is to drive out of business a little company that manufactures ice cream that's used there, that company would not have standing? So if Bailey's was the only place that sold this chocolate sauce, Bailey's might have standing. That would be similar to this case. But if other places also sold this chocolate sauce, then Bailey's is out. Suppose that Lexmark had not made disparaging comments about Static Control, but had simply made false statements about its own product. Suppose it said that if you use our products, our cartridges, they will emit some sort of vapor in your house that will promote good health. Who would be within the zone of interests there? Who would be within the zone of interest? Only -- would other printer cartridge manufacturers be within the zone of interest in that situation? Well, it's not a reasonable interest test then. Am I correct to think that your rule is that the only people who have standing under the Lanham Act are competitors and people whose products are disparaged? And if that is true, then are you not arguably advocating the most restrictive test for Lanham Act standing other than the categorical rule?

2013,BG Group PLC v. Argentina,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","I'm not sure that this argument helps you, but it's your argument. But this arbitration took place in the United States because the parties agreed that's where it would take place, right? So your -- your argument is that by agreeing that the arbitration would take place in the United States, they bought into U.S. arbitration law, no international modification? See, I would have thought that there would -- there'd be an argument for saying that the first options principle shouldn't apply to international -- or to a bilateral investment treaty. The whole point of these treaties, as I understand it, is to take these disputes out of the courts because of distrust, at least of the courts of the country against which the claim is asserted, and -- and put it in an international tribunal where some sort of standard international principles would apply, but that's -- you don't like the idea. Could I ask you just a -- a practical question and maybe the answer to this is obvious. Is it too late now for you to begin litigation in Argentina? Wait 18 months and then pursue arbitration? What about this -- what about this principle. If something, if some requirement seems to serve virtually no purpose, it's unlikely to be a condition of consent; would you accept that? Well, there is nothing in the treaty that talks about consent at all, so we have to decide whether some requirement is a consent, is on something which consent is conditioned, or it's just a procedural requirement that would be decided by an arbitrator. Would you not -- would you disagree with the proposition that if something really is trivial, it doesn't seem to accomplish much of anything. It's a historical vestige. It's unlikely to be a condition of consent. Well, you said a few minutes ago you were going to explain why this litigation requirement is important. And that is important to me because I don't see what it accomplishes. I can understand a waiting period, but this is more than a waiting period. You have a party who doesn't want to litigate in the -- in the courts of Argentina. It doesn't think it's going to get a fair shake there. What is the point of requiring this -- now, I understand, it's a requirement. But if it's not very important, if it isn't going to achieve anything, that seems to me to weigh against the conclusion that it's a -- that it is a condition of consent. Let me just interrupt before -- before the time expires. But I don't understand -- I don't know what the procedure is in Argentina. Let's assume their civil procedure is like ours. So you say they have to file a complaint. All right. They file a one-page complaint. They do the minimal necessary to keep the case alive in court. Maybe they don't even do that, because they don't care; they don't want the thing to be -- to be decided. All they're doing is running out the 18 months. What is achieved by that? Well, let's say they avail themselves of the procedure in only the most perfunctory way so as to satisfy the 18-month requirement. But not for the purpose-- --You're really -- you're not answering-- --You're not answering my question. What is -- if they do not litigate the matter in -- in such a way as to get a decision on any of these local law issues, they just keep it alive perfunctorily for 18 months, what is achieved by that? ",I be not sure that this argument help you but it be your argument but this arbitration take place in the united state because the party agree that be where it would take place right so your your argument be that by agree that the arbitration would take place in the united state they buy into us arbitration law no international modification see i would have think that there would there would be an argument for say that the first option principle should not apply to international or to a bilateral investment treaty the whole point of these treaty as i understand it be to take these dispute out of the court because of distrust at least of the court of the country against which the claim be assert and and put it in an international tribunal where some sort of standard international principle would apply but that be you do not like the idea could i ask you just a a practical question and maybe the answer to this be obvious be it too late now for you to begin litigation in argentina wait month and then pursue arbitration what about this what about this principle if something if some requirement seem to serve virtually no purpose it be unlikely to be a condition of consent would you accept that well there be nothing in the treaty that talk about consent at all so we have to decide whether some requirement be a consent be on something which consent be condition or it be just a procedural requirement that would be decide by an arbitrator would you not would you disagree with the proposition that if something really be trivial it do not seem to accomplish much of anything it be a historical vestige it be unlikely to be a condition of consent well you say a few minute ago you we be go to explain why this litigation requirement be important and that be important to me because i do not see what it accomplish i can understand a waiting period but this be more than a waiting period you have a party who do not want to litigate in the in the court of argentina it do not think it be go to get a fair shake there what be the point of require this now i understand it be a requirement but if it be not very important if it be not go to achieve anything that seem to me to weigh against the conclusion that it be a that it be a condition of consent let me just interrupt before before the time expire but i do not understand i do not know what the procedure be in argentina let us assume their civil procedure be like ours so you say they have to file a complaint all right they file a one page complaint they do the minimal necessary to keep the case alive in court maybe they do not even do that because they do not care they do not want the thing to be to be decide all they be do be run out the month what be achieve by that well let us say they avail themselves of the procedure in only the most perfunctory way so as to satisfy the month requirement but not for the purpose you be really you be not answer you be not answer my question what be if they do not litigate the matter in in such a way as to get a decision on any of these local law issue they just keep it alive perfunctorily for month what be achieve by that ,185.86999999999995,Roberts Court,"Dec 2, 2013",BG Group PLC,Republic of Argentina,12-138,"Jun 10, 2013","Mar 5, 2014",112,1.0,1.0,0.0,1
2013,Town of Greece v. Galloway,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","May I ask you about the individual plaintiffs here. And what do we know about them? They obviously have appeared at proceedings and they object to the proceedings. Does the record show that they had matters before the town council during the hearings part of the proceeding? Well, what about the public forum part? They did speak occasionally then; isn't that right? Do we know what they spoke about? And what did they -- what was the issue there? But that's during the public -- that's during the public forum part. Which is not really -- it's not the same thing as the hearing. There's another -- there's another part of the proceeding that is the hearing. And that's when somebody has a specific proposal. They want to -- something specifically before the board and they want relief. They want a variance. And that is separated in time. But that is a legislative body at that point. It's clearly a legislative body, is it not? The only -- the difference is it's a town rather than -- than Congress or a State legislature where you have more formalized procedures. This is -- this is more direct democracy. Or it's like a -- it's a town meeting. Well, if that is your argument, then you are really saying you can never have prayer at a town meeting. How could you do it? Because that's the kind of thing that always comes up at town meetings. All right. Give me an example. Give me an example of a prayer that would be acceptable to Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus. Give me an example of a prayer. Wiccans, Baha'i. Give me an example then. I think the point about atheists is a good point. But exclude them for present purposes and give me an example of a prayer that is acceptable to all of the groups that I mentioned. Give me an example. To “ the almighty ”. So if -- if a particular religion believes in more than one god, that's acceptable to them? 74a, “ Heavenly father ”, that's acceptable to all religions? Let me give you an example of a practice that's a little bit different. Maybe you'll say it's a lot different from what the Town of Greece does. First of all, this town starts out by making -- by proceeding in a more systematic and comprehensive way in recruiting chaplains for the month or whatever it is. So instead of just looking to all the houses of worship within the town, it identifies places of worship that may be outside the town boundaries that people within the town who adhere to a minority religion may attend. And it makes it clear that it's open to chaplains of any religious -- of any religion on a rotating basis. And then they have -- they structure their proceedings so that you have the prayer, and then the legislative part of the town meeting. And then there's a clear separation in time and access between that part of the proceeding and the hearing where variances and things of that nature are held. Now, you would still say that's unconstitutional because you have to add on that a prayer that is acceptable to everybody; is that it? Is there any other problem with what I've just outlined? Well, that gets exactly to the -- that gets exactly to the problem with your argument about nonsectarian prayer. Yes, when -- at the beginning of the country, the population was 98 percent-plus Protestant. Then it became predominantly Christian. Then it became predominant -- almost exclusively Christian and Jewish. And it -- but now, it's not that -- it's -- it's gone much further than that. So we have a very religiously diverse country. There are a lot of Muslims, there are a lot of Hindus, there are Buddhists, there are Baha'is, there are all sorts of other adherents to all sorts of other religions. And they all should be treated equally, and -- but I don't -- I just don't see how it is possible to compose anything that you could call a prayer that is acceptable to all of these groups. And you haven't given me an example. Well, Marsh is not the source of government involvement religion in this respect. The First Congress is the source. The First Congress that also adopted the First Amendment. Many of them were very explicitly Christian, were they not? My understanding is that the first chaplain of the Senate was the Episcopal bishop of New York; isn't that correct? And he used to read -- he took his prayers from the Book of Common Prayer. That was acceptable to Baptists at the time, Quakers?

2013,Fifth Third Bancorp v. Dudenhoeffer,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","In an ESOP -- in an ESOP, can the fiduciary take into account the interests of the participants as employees as opposed to their interests as investors? It doesn't seem to me that those will necessarily always be the same. And there may be situations in which something that would be potentially good for the participants as investors would be quite bad for them as employees. They want to keep their jobs. They want the company to stay afloat. Can that properly be taken into account, or is that outside of the bounds? No, I'm not saying only as employees, but I'm saying can you take that into account at all? If you're in the situation where stopping trade -- stopping purchases in company stock would be a signal that would potentially trigger bankruptcy and liquidation for the company, can that be taken into account? It might not be in the best interests -- if the -- if the -- if these participants were simply investors, it might be in their best interests to stop buying the stock. But if taking that step would have the consequences that I mentioned, it might be very much not in their best interests as employees. What do they have to do then? You said they can't sell the stock based on that information. What are they supposed to do? Or is it your argument that they just never -- you never should have insiders serving as trustees; you always have to have an outside running these ESOPs? So you're basically saying that if it's not flatly prohibited, it is very unwise. It generally shouldn't happen. You're putting yourself in an impossible position if you are an insider and you're going to serve as a trustee of an ESOP. Do you think the trustee has a duty to acquire inside information? The trustees say, I don't want to know insider information. I'm going to put myself in exactly the position of an outside trustee, so I'm going to take into account only public information, I'm not going to do an investigation. What's the answer to my question? Assuming that-- --permissible for an insider to be in this position, can the insider behave like an outsider? But you say they should sell based on the inside information? Well, let me give you this example. It's helpful to have something concrete here and not just general statements of -- of -- about fiduciary duty. Let's say that the trustee receives inside information that someone has alleged that corporate office -- a particular corporate officer has engaged in illegal conduct. And if it turns out that that conduct actually took place, that -- that information -- that will cause damage to the company. But it's -- it's -- it hasn't been proven. There's simply been an allegation. Now, what -- at that point, what does the trustee -- what do you think the trustee has to do? If that information were available to the public, let's say it would cause the price of the stock to go down, so it's material -- it's material information, but at a somewhat preliminary stage. What do you do? Completely stop buying the stock? You can't sell. Disclose the information? What is supposed to be done? Well, that's -- no. But -- but would that information have to be disclosed under the securities laws? Let's say there was no prior -- no prior misleading statement regarding this matter. Eventually. ",in an esop in an esop can the fiduciary take into account the interest of the participant as employee as oppose to their interest as investor it do not seem to me that those will necessarily always be the same and there may be situation in which something that would be potentially good for the participant as investor would be quite bad for them as employee they want to keep their job they want the company to stay afloat can that properly be take into account or be that outside of the bound no I be not say only as employee but I be say can you take that into account at all if you be in the situation where stop trade stop purchase in company stock would be a signal that would potentially trigger bankruptcy and liquidation for the company can that be take into account it might not be in the best interest if the if the if these participant we be simply investor it might be in their best interest to stop buy the stock but if take that step would have the consequence that i mention it might be very much not in their best interest as employee what do they have to do then you say they can not sell the stock base on that information what be they suppose to do or be it your argument that they just never you never should have insider serve as trustee you always have to have an outside run these esop so you be basically say that if it be not flatly prohibit it be very unwise it generally should not happen you be put yourself in an impossible position if you be an insider and you be go to serve as a trustee of an esop do you think the trustee have a duty to acquire inside information the trustee say i do not want to know insider information I be go to put myself in exactly the position of an outside trustee so I be go to take into account only public information I be not go to do an investigation what be the answer to my question assume that permissible for an insider to be in this position can the insider behave like an outsider but you say they should sell base on the inside information well let me give you this example it be helpful to have something concrete here and not just general statement of of about fiduciary duty let us say that the trustee receive inside information that someone have allege that corporate office a particular corporate officer have engage in illegal conduct and if it turn out that that conduct actually take place that that information that will because damage to the company but it be it have it have not be proven there be simply be an allegation now what at that point what do the trustee what do you think the trustee have to do if that information we be available to the public let us say it would because the price of the stock to go down so it be material it be material information but at a somewhat preliminary stage what do you do completely stop buying the stock you can not sell disclose the information what be suppose to be do well that be no but but would that information have to be disclose under the security law let us say there be no prior no prior misleading statement regard this matter eventually ,190.64000000000007,Roberts Court,"Apr 2, 2014","Fifth Third Bancorp, et al.","John Dudenhoeffer, et al.",12-751,"Dec 13, 2013","Jun 25, 2014",112,1.0,1.0,0.0,1
2013,Burrage v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","But part of your argument is that but-for causation isn't sufficient, right? It also has to be foreseeable. Is that your argument? Now, give me an example of a situation where a heroin dealer deals -- sells drugs to somebody, and foresees that the drugs that are sold will cause death? Those are very unusual circumstances. In all other circumstances where somebody is just selling heroin there wouldn't be foreseeable, so the statute wouldn't -- foreseeability; the statute wouldn't apply? Well, let's compare what -- the situation that Justice Kagan just described with this situation. The heroin dealer sells a user, I don't know, a three-day supply or four-day supply, whatever it is. And tells the -- the user, now, you should only use this much per day. But the user goes off and injects the whole amount and -- and dies as a result of an overdose. Now, why would Congress want to punish that person where the overdose -- where the heroin sold is the but-for cause of death and not the situation where there's the -- the multidrug cocktail? Well, I understand that. That's a textual argument and maybe the text can be read both ways. Assuming it can be read both ways, why would Congress want to attach these severe consequences in the overdose case and not in the drug cocktail case? I don't see how this foreseeability test would work. Well, you'd have testimony what, this particular user looked -- looked like a healthy person, so there wasn't -- it wasn't foreseeable that that person was going to overdose. This other one looked kind of shaky and irresponsible and who knows what the person might do. That's what we -- that's what the jury would have to evaluate? Well, what sort of facts? Suppose you -- you have the heroin dealer, is a responsible heroin dealer. [Laughter] And he wants to sell heroin but doesn't want to cause anybody to die. What would be kind of the checklist that the person would go through? All right, I'm going to sell this. I take the risk of a drug conviction, but I don't want this death results business. So a person is well dressed. Person is -- what would be the factors? No. But I want my -- I want the checklist for my responsible heroin dealer on the street corner. What does this person go through? Before -- Mr. Horwich, before we leave this hypothetical-- --may me ask you this. If I were a member of a legislative body considering what I would want to happen in this situation -- it's kind of a frightening thought. But if that were, I would want to know what kind of testimony medical experts can reasonable be expected to provide in cases like this, where there is the ingestion of multiple drugs. If it is possible in most cases, many cases, all cases, a high percentage of cases, for them to break this down probabilistically, there was a 50 -- this made it 50 percent more likely, 90 percent more likely, 10 percent more likely, I might want to go down that road.

2013,Sandifer v. United States Steel Corporation,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Why is it that the jacket and the pants in that picture are not clothes? This is one of the aspects of your argument that seems really puzzling to me. I don't know when a human being first got the idea of putting on clothing. I think it was one of the main reasons, probably the main reason, was for protection. It's for protection against the cold, it's for protection against the sun. It's for protection against -- against thorns. So you want us to hold that items that are worn for purposes of protection are not clothing? So if it -- if it protects against something other than workplace hazard, it can be clothes. But if it protects against a workplace hazard, it isn't clothing. Is that your test? What if you are working out in the sun? So you are wearing clothing so that you don't get burned by the sun. What if you are working out in the cold and you wear a parka so that you don't freeze while you're working? Are those workplace hazards? No, but if the union -- is it consistent with the union's duty to represent your client for them to bargain away something to which your clients are entitled under the Fair Labor Standards Act? No, no, the union. If the union-- Well, nothing has been said about the word “ changing ”. Maybe you could say something about that. Isn't it -- isn't it awkward to refer to the changing of clothes when all that the person is doing is putting on clothing on top of clothing that the person is already wearing? That's not the way the term is normally used, is it? What you just said -- what you just said, I find quite confusing. I can make a list of things that are considered to be clothing. One of them would be a jacket perhaps. One would be a vest. And if you tell me that a vest is not clothing if it's made out of metal, then I don't know why Mr. Schnapper is not right that a jacket is not a jacket if it's got extra flame protection -- protecting chemicals in it. But when somebody in the meat packing industry puts on something that would be clothing but also puts on all these other things that you say are not clothing, you would say in that situation putting on all this additional stuff is not ancillary, and that is for what reason? Because it takes more time in relation to the clothing or the number of non-clothing items exceeds the number of non-clothing items? What does that mean? What is the practice in the poultry industry to which you referred? Are those unionized workplaces and have they bargained on this issue? And under -- where they have collective bargaining agreements, are they compensated for this time or not?

2013,Kansas v. Cheever,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","General Schmidt, am I wrong to think that the issue in this case is whether there was compulsion at the time when the statement was made to the -- the court-ordered expert? That's the issue. It's not -- it wouldn't be a question of whether there was a violation of the Fifth Amendment privilege at the time when the statements were later introduced in the Kansas trial. Isn't it very well settled in this Court's precedents that the introduction of statements obtained -- that the introduction of statements at a trial is not -- does not implicate the Fifth Amendment privilege? Well, that's the issue, as I see it. But maybe I'm wrong. Correct me if I'm wrong. And maybe Mr. Katyal will. That the issue is whether there was unconstitutional compulsion at the time when the statements were obtained. But I thought it was very well settled that if there -- there wasn't compulsion at that time, then the later introduction of the statements into the -- into evidence at the trial does not implicate the privilege against self-incrimination. So what happened in -- in State court really is -- is irrelevant to this. This is -- everything that -- everything important here was done under Rule 12.2 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and that's -- and that's the issue. Why would that-- --Yes, sure. Isn't the question here whether Rule 12.2 is constitutional? Everything that was done here seems to me to have been done in compliance with Rule 12.2 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. So if there's -- insofar as the taking of the statement is concerned, which I'm suggesting is the issue and not the later introduction in the Kansas court. Am I wrong on that? That would be -- that's not a -- that's not a self-incrimination question, though, isn't it? It's a due process question. It's an unreasonable limitation on the defendant's ability to put on a defense. No, but there wouldn't be at that point -- suppose the Federal Rules simply said you can't have an expert testify about mental condition, period. That's a -- that raises a due process issue, and maybe there would be a serious due process question involved. Okay. Up to that point, we're not quite at the Fifth Amendment. Well, suppose we -- suppose we agree with you and the response is the adoption of a new Federal rule of evidence or a State rule of evidence that says that evidence of a -- that an expert who testifies for the defense as to the mental -- the insanity or mental state of a defendant is very unreliable if there has not been an opportunity for the defendant to be examined by another expert and therefore is just inadmissible.

2013,Hall v. Florida,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","May I come back to a question? May I come back to something similar to what Justice Sotomayor started out with. In your view, does the Constitution establish a State to establish any hard cutoff? Let's say 76. Can it do that? All right. If it can do that -- oh, I'm sorry. Which party has the burden of persuasion on the issue of IQ and what is the standard? I mean, what -- what does the Eighth Amendment require? Does the Eighth Amendment permit a State to assign to the defendant the burden of persuasion on -- on IQ, IQ above 75? Can they assign that burden of -- above 70? Can they assign that to the defendant, and if they can what is the standard of proof that the defendant has to meet? Why can't the State -- you told me that the State can establish a hard cutoff. And you told me that a State can assign the burden to the defendant. Now, in the case of someone who scores 75, is it not the case that there's roughly -- there's no more than a 2.5 percent chance that that person's real IQ is 70. So how does that square with any burden of proof that might be -- any standard of proof that might be assigned on that -- on that point? That's what I don't understand about your argument. No, I understand. But I'm talking about the general issue. Just hypothetically-- --I understand that argument. But that doesn't seem to me consistent with your point that a State can establish a hard cutoff. 76, that's the end. You get a 76 on an IQ test, that's the end of the inquiry. The person does not -- does not -- does not qualify under Atkins. On Justice Breyer's last point, before your -- your time expires, because I do think this is important. Is there not another way of proving reliability? Suppose -- what about multiple tests? Suppose someone is given 25 Wechsler tests and 24 times the person scores 76 and one time the person scores 72. What would you deal with -- how would you deal with that in a State that has a hard cutoff? That's not consistent with my understanding of it, but I don't claim that I have a deep understanding of it. But what -- what would be your answer to my hypothetical? Where there are multiple scores that are above the hard cutoff but one that's below -- and I will ask the State the opposite question -- what would you do there? Well, what does the Eighth Amendment require, in your view? Is it the case that those who use IQ tests always require a 95 percent confidence level and always must require a 95 percent confidence level? Let's suppose a school on the other end of the IQ scale wants to identify gifted children and they say a child is gifted if the child has an IQ of 130 or above. So they say if you have an obtained score of 130, you're in. You're in the gifted child program, even though there is the same percentage that would be -- would be the case with respect to someone with an IQ of 70, that really the person is below 130. Would there be something wrong with their doing that? Do they -- are there places that do that?

2013,Rosemond v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, give me an example of that. Give us-- --And I don't -- I don't understand the example. The -- the alleged aider and abetter learns about this after it's happened? That's the idea? Well, let me change -- let me -- maybe this is the same as Justice Scalia's hypothetical, but let me try it. Suppose that two guys have a meeting and it's -- it's in a place that's -- where there's an electronic eavesdropping device. In fact, there's a camera. So it's all recorded. So we know exactly what was said. And the principal says, here's the deal, I'm going to rob a convenience store and I'm going to carry a gun. And the aider and abetter says, well, all right. I'm in on the -- you know, I'm in on robbing the convenience store, but I don't want anything having to do with the gun. I think you should carry a baseball bat. The principal says, no, that's the deal. I'm robbing the store. I'm carrying a gun. Take it or leave it. Are you going to drive me there? And -- and the other guy says, I hate guns, I don't want to have anything to do with guns. I -- I hate this idea about the guns. They go back and forth. And the -- the principal says finally, look, this is it. This is the deal. I'm using a gun. Are you going to help me or not? And the guy says, well, all right. I'm going to drive you, but I want it noted for the record that I'm opposed -- I'm opposed to the use of a gun. [Laughter] See -- so I don't really see -- I can't -- I can't think of a situation where a person facilitates the crime, knows what the crime is going to be, knows that a gun is going to be used but doesn't intend for the gun to be used. In those two situations, knowledge and intent, seem to me to be -- to be the same thing. Well, I don't understand your hypotheticals. If you could give it to us again. But you facilitate-- --Or in my -- in my hypothetical, could a rational jury say he knew about it, but he didn't intend it? Well, in my case -- and I'll finish. I want to ask another question about this. But in my case, if the judge had given the instruction, it's enough that he knew about it. He facilitated the crime when he knew there was a gun. Would that be error? I understand your argument about intent, but are you also arguing that the -- that the actus reus instruction was insufficient? The instruction about what your client did? Do you think it's necessary for an aider and abetter to facilitate every element of a criminal offense? So if there were not -- if the -- the drug offense were not illegal, there -- there wasn't a drug offense and then the -- the additional firearm element, it wouldn't be necessary for him -- for the defendant to facilitate every element of that offense. It's dependent on the fact that there's this other criminal conduct. Well, let me go back to my earlier hypothetical about the taped conversation. Suppose that the alleged aider and abetter there says, I intend for you to use the gun. I have that intent. However, I'm not going to do one thing to help you get the gun or use the gun. I don't want to -- I'm not going to. There's an actus reus problem there because he doesn't facilitate the use of the gun? Could the defendant here have -- could the defendant here have been convicted of possession of the ammunition on the theory that -- under the instructions -- would the instructions have allowed that conviction on the theory that the defendant aided and abetted somebody else's possession of the ammunition?

2013,White v. Woodall,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Ms. Lenz, am I correct, the instruction that was requested but not given was as follows: Quote, ""A defendant is not compelled to testify and the fact that the defendant did not testify should not prejudice him in any way. "" That was the instruction? So suppose that the -- you put on evidence of -- to show that he was qualified for the death penalty and put on evidence of aggravating factors, and the defense put on absolutely no mitigation evidence. The instruction would say, would it not, that the fact that the defendant did not testify should not prejudice him in any way with respect to the failure to put on any mitigation evidence at all? Is that correct? Well, when a party has the burden of producing evidence on something, isn't the customary way of dealing with that to instruct the jury that the defendant had the burden of producing evidence to show this, rather than to -- to talk about inferences that can be drawn from their failure, from that party's failure to produce evidence. Well, the jury was instructed: ""You shall consider such mitigating or extenuating facts and circumstances as have been presented to you in the evidence and you believe to be true. "" Now, I suppose they could have been -- the mitigating evidence could have been put in by the prosecution, but for the most part they're going to be put in by the defense. So when the judge says you can consider whatever mitigating evidence has been presented to you, isn't that tantamount to saying that the defendant has the burden of producing evidence of mitigation if the defendant wants to do that? Let me -- let me give you this example. Let me pretend to be a juror in a -- in a Kentucky capital case. And the -- and let's assume in this case the prosecution puts on evidence to show eligibility and some evidence of aggravating factors. The defense puts on no evidence of mitigation. Now, the judge tells me you shall consider such mitigating or extenuating facts and circumstances as have been presented to you in the evidence, and you believe to be true. Okay? That's Instruction Number 4. I assume that you don't have an objection to that. And then the judge gives the instruction that you requested: A defendant is not compelled to testify, and the fact that the defendant did not testify should not prejudice him in any way. So now I'm back in the jury room, and I say, well, now I have to consider mitigating evidence. And, you know, there are a lot of things that could be mitigating in a capital case. I'd like to know about the defendant's childhood. I'd like to know whether the defendant was -- was abused. I'd like to know whether the defendant was remorseful. And I haven't heard anything about this. And I don't know what to do because the judge told me I should consider the mitigating evidence that's been presented to me. On the other hand, the judge told me that the failure -- the fact that the defendant didn't put on any mitigating evidence can't prejudice him in any way. So what am I supposed to do? No, it doesn't really. It says the fact that he didn't testify, and he could have testified about child -- about his childhood or about remorse or any of these other things, that shouldn't prejudice him in any way. Well, just tell me what I'm supposed to do as a juror. The judge says consider the evidence that's put before you, but the fact that the defendant didn't put this evidence before you in the form of his testimony shouldn't prejudice him in any way. I'm -- I'm pulled in two different directions. I don't know what to do. Well, what it may show is that the prosecutor didn't think that it was going to make a difference, and so why raise an objection that could create everything that's happened since then, over something that isn't going to make a difference in a case where you have an incredibly heinous crime.

What do you think is the worse adverse inference they might have drawn? ",ms lenz be i correct the instruction that be request but not give be as follow quote a defendant be not compel to testify and the fact that the defendant do not testify should not prejudice him in any way that be the instruction so suppose that the you put on evidence of to show that he be qualify for the death penalty and put on evidence of aggravate factor and the defense put on absolutely no mitigation evidence the instruction would say would it not that the fact that the defendant do not testify should not prejudice him in any way with respect to the failure to put on any mitigation evidence at all be that correct well when a party have the burden of produce evidence on something be not the customary way of deal with that to instruct the jury that the defendant have the burden of produce evidence to show this rather than to to talk about inference that can be draw from their failure from that party s failure to produce evidence well the jury be instruct you shall consider such mitigating or extenuate fact and circumstance as have be present to you in the evidence and you believe to be true now i suppose they could have be the mitigate evidence could have be put in by the prosecution but for the most part they be go to be put in by the defense so when the judge say you can consider whatever mitigate evidence have be present to you be not that tantamount to say that the defendant have the burden of produce evidence of mitigation if the defendant want to do that let me let me give you this example let me pretend to be a juror in a in a kentucky capital case and the and let us assume in this case the prosecution put on evidence to show eligibility and some evidence of aggravate factor the defense put on no evidence of mitigation now the judge tell me you shall consider such mitigating or extenuate fact and circumstance as have be present to you in the evidence and you believe to be true okay that be instruction number i assume that you do not have an objection to that and then the judge give the instruction that you request a defendant be not compel to testify and the fact that the defendant do not testify should not prejudice him in any way so now I be back in the jury room and i say well now i have to consider mitigate evidence and you know there be a lot of thing that could be mitigate in a capital case I would like to know about the defendant s childhood I have like to know whether the defendant be be abuse I would like to know whether the defendant be remorseful and i have not hear anything about this and i do not know what to do because the judge tell me i should consider the mitigating evidence that be be present to me on the other hand the judge tell me that the failure the fact that the defendant do not put on any mitigating evidence can not prejudice him in any way so what be i suppose to do no it do not really it say the fact that he do not testify and he could have testify about child about his childhood or about remorse or any of these other thing that should not prejudice him in any way well just tell me what I be suppose to do as a juror the judge say consider the evidence that be put before you but the fact that the defendant do not put this evidence before you in the form of his testimony should not prejudice him in any way I be I be pull in two different direction i do not know what to do well what it may show be that the prosecutor do not think that it be go to make a difference and so why raise an objection that could create everything that be happen since then over something that be not go to make a difference in a case where you have an incredibly heinous crime the prosecutor may have think this jury be go to return the verdict that i want anyway even if this instruction be give you do not think that be a possibility what do you think be the bad adverse inference they might have draw ,239.1,Roberts Court,"Dec 11, 2013","Randy White, Warden",Robert Keith Woodall,12-794,"Jun 27, 2013","Apr 23, 2014",112,1.0,1.0,0.0,1

2013,Loughrin v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","How would that -- how would that work? Would the jury have to be instructed about the U.C.C. and be asked to determine whether the bank or Target, in this case, would be liable for the funds if the bank had honored a forged check? Why would it not matter? No, under your view. Under your view that there has to be an intent to defraud a bank. Why would it not matter from -- who would ultimately be liable for the -- for the money -- for the amount of the check? I think you have a -- you have a credible textual argument, but you run into the problem that your interpretation makes Section -- Subsection 1 surplusage. How do you get around that? Well, under the alternative, there is certainly overlap, but (2) reaches a much broader category or it reaches a broader category. So it's not useless. Representation doesn't have to be made to the bank under (2). (2) covers those instances where the representation is made to somebody else. (1) would be limited to those, perhaps, in which the representation is made to the bank. But under your interpretation where (2) requires that the representation be made to the bank, there is no point in having two subsections. You might as well just have one. Well, could I ask you this question? Suppose the defendant testifies and suppose the jury believes the defendant. The defendant testifies as follows: I never intended to defraud the bank. I knew that the cashiers at this particular retail establishment were incredibly careful -- careless and so I got these checks and they were made out to my neighbor John Doe. I stole them from his mailbox. I crossed out his name and I wrote in the name of the retail establishment and I knew these cashiers were so careless that they would honor the check. However, I never thought any bank would do that. So I didn't intend to defraud the bank. I intended to defraud the retail establishment. Now, under your theory that -- that if the jury believed that, the person would not be guilty of the offense. Usually there won't be evidence, direct evidence of the defendant's intent. So the defendant's intent will be inferred from objective evidence -- will be inferred from other evidence, and then you will get into the question of whether the retailer who initially accepts the check or the bank is ultimately going to be liable for the amount of that check. If you're -- if you're in a situation in which the -- the retailer is going to be liable, that -- maybe that supports the -- the inference that the defendant never intended to defraud the bank. If you're in a situation where the bank is going to be liable, it supports the inference that the defendant intended to defraud the bank. So won't you get into this somewhat complicated UCC question about who is ultimately going to be liable for the amount? I think that's a problem with your argument, but maybe there's an answer to it. Along those lines, if we were to agree that under sub (2) it was necessary to show an intent to defraud the bank, what would the government have to prove in an altered check case? Or what would you have had to prove under sub (1) if this case could properly be prosecuted under sub (1)? What I'm getting at is would this require delving into the defendant's knowledge of the legal relationship between the merchant here and the bank? Doesn't the answer depend on from whom -- for whom the money, either owned or under -- in the custody of the bank has to be obtained? If it -- if it doesn't have to be obtained by the defendant, then it wouldn't seem to me that there would be much of a question. Because even if the only thing that the defendant obtains from the merchant is an Xbox, if the -- if the check is honored, it is going to be obtained by the merchant. Somebody is going to be obtaining money from the bank if the check is ultimately honored. Right. The ultimate-- Your textual hook is that there -- that the representation has to be made to the bank, right? That's the only way you can get this within the statute. But that's different from an intent to defraud the bank, isn't it? But where is the textual silence about -- where do you get intent to deceive the bank into this? Where do you get it the from the text? I understand the argument. It's a -- it's a very credible argument. It doesn't say to whom the representations have to be made. So you put in to the bank. I don't see how you get from there to defrauding the bank. ",how would that how would that work would the jury have to be instruct about the youcc and be ask to determine whether the bank or target in this case would be liable for the fund if the bank have honor a forge check why would it not matter no under your view under your view that there have to be an intent to defraud a bank why would it not matter from who would ultimately be liable for the for the money for the amount of the check i think you have a you have a credible textual argument but you run into the problem that your interpretation make section subsection surplusage how do you get around that well under the alternative there be certainly overlap but reach a much broad category or it reach a broad category so it be not useless representation do not have to be make to the bank under cover those instance where the representation be make to somebody else would be limit to those perhaps in which the representation be make to the bank but under your interpretation where require that the representation be make to the bank there be no point in have two subsection you might as well just have one well could i ask you this question suppose the defendant testifies and suppose the jury believe the defendant the defendant testify as follow i never intend to defraud the bank i know that the cashier at this particular retail establishment we be incredibly careful careless and so i get these check and they we be make out to my neighbor john doe i steal them from his mailbox i cross out his name and i write in the name of the retail establishment and i know these cashier we be so careless that they would honor the check however i never think any bank would do that so i do not intend to defraud the bank i intend to defraud the retail establishment now under your theory that that if the jury believe that the person would not be guilty of the offense usually there will not be evidence direct evidence of the defendant s intent so the defendant s intent will be infer from objective evidence will be infer from other evidence and then you will get into the question of whether the retailer who initially accept the check or the bank be ultimately go to be liable for the amount of that check if you be if you be in a situation in which the the retailer be go to be liable that maybe that support the the inference that the defendant never intend to defraud the bank if you be in a situation where the bank be go to be liable it support the inference that the defendant intend to defraud the bank so will not you get into this somewhat complicated ucc question about who be ultimately go to be liable for the amount i think that be a problem with your argument but maybe there be an answer to it along those line if we we be to agree that under sub it be necessary to show an intent to defraud the bank what would the government have to prove in an altered check case or what would you have have to prove under sub if this case could properly be prosecute under sub what I be get at be would this require delving into the defendant s knowledge of the legal relationship between the merchant here and the bank do not the answer depend on from whom for whom the money either own or under in the custody of the bank have to be obtain if it if it do not have to be obtain by the defendant then it would not seem to me that there would be much of a question because even if the only thing that the defendant obtain from the merchant be an xbox if the if the check be honor it be go to be obtain by the merchant somebody be go to be obtain money from the bank if the check be ultimately honor right the ultimate your textual hook be that there that the representation have to be make to the bank right that be the only way you can get this within the statute but that be different from an intent to defraud the bank be not it but where be the textual silence about where do you get intent to deceive the bank into this where do you get it the from the text i understand the argument it be a it be a very credible argument it do not say to whom the representation have to be make so you put in to the bank i do not see how you get from there to defraud the bank ,276.4099999999999,Roberts Court,"Apr 1, 2014",Kevin Loughrin,United States,13-316,"Dec 13, 2013","Jun 23, 2014",112,0.0,1.0,0.0,0

2013,Abramski v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, in the gift -- in the gift situation. But Congress requires certain information from the buyer, whatever that means; right? The -- the dealer has to record the name of the buyer; right? And the address of the buyer? And do an instant check on the buyer? Now, why would -- why would Congress have wanted those things with respect to the person who was just the straw purchaser and not the person -- the person who's actually going to acquire the weapon? Why wouldn't they be concerned about the starting point? Let's say there's a man, Mr. Straw, and he holds himself out as a gun buyer, puts, you know, a website, creates a website. He puts something in the Yellow Pages under ""Straw Man"". And he says: You want to acquire a gun and you don't want the dealer to record your name and you don't want to have an instant check on you, you come to me. And so these people come to him and whenever they do, he goes to Joe's gun shop and -- with the other person. He says, I want to buy a gun, but this fellow with me is going to do all the talking. So the guy who's with him talks with Joe about different types of guns, costs and everything. After that's done, the person who's done all the talking says, now, my friend, Mr. Straw, is going to buy this gun. He gives Mr. Straw the money, Mr. Straw buys the gun, and the dealer writes down Mr. Straw's name for the fifteenth time that month, his address, does another instant check on it. What sense does that make? You still have not explained what purpose is served by obtaining the name of the straw purchaser and doing an instant check on the straw purchaser. You said that it allows the tracing of the weapon, but that's not going to be true in the case of a straw purchaser, because the person, the straw purchaser, isn't necessarily and probably in the vast majority of cases isn't going to get the name or any information about the actual recipient. That's the whole purpose of having a straw purchaser. So then what purpose is served by this? It's just meaningless. So they find the gun dealer and the gun dealer says, I sold it to Mr. Straw. And then they go to Mr. Straw and Mr. Straw said: My client took it. Okay, who's your client? I have no idea. He came into my store. He contacted me. I didn't ask his name. He didn't give me his name. And that's the end of it. So no purpose is served by putting down the name, the address, doing the check on the straw purchaser. Well, what you're saying is they did a meaningless thing. That was the compromise. They would do something that's utterly meaningless. If we disagree with you on the first point about the straw purchaser, would you -- would you lose on the grounds that Mr. Abramski's uncle could not have lawfully purchased the gun at that store because he wasn't a resident of the State? But he couldn't have taken possession of it in -- in Pennsylvania. In Virginia. But would it have been a lawful sale if the gun had been delivered to him on the spot? Yes. He could not -- Mr. Abramski is out of the picture and the uncle goes in, buys the gun, puts down a Pennsylvania address. The dealer gives him the gun and walks out of the store. That -- would that be a lawful sale? Well, I meant my hypothetical. So he doesn't have -- he doesn't put it in the Yellow Pages and he doesn't put it on the Internet. He just hangs around in the parking lot at Joe's to accommodate people who -- and Joe's is near the border, and he wants to accommodate people who may take it -- who wish to employ him as a straw purchaser. Well, if we agreed with you on the -- on the second argument, would the government have to prove that the person to whom the straw purchaser transferred the gun was ineligible or would it be a defense if it was shown that the person was eligible? ",well in the gift in the gift situation but congress require certain information from the buyer whatever that mean right the the dealer have to record the name of the buyer right and the address of the buyer and do an instant check on the buyer now why would why would congress have want those thing with respect to the person who be just the straw purchaser and not the person the person who be actually go to acquire the weapon why would not they be concern about the start point let us say there be a man mr straw and he hold himself out as a gun buyer put you know a website create a website he put something in the yellow page under straw man and he say you want to acquire a gun and you do not want the dealer to record your name and you do not want to have an instant check on you you come to me and so these people come to him and whenever they do he go to joe s gun shop and with the other person he say i want to buy a gun but this fellow with me be go to do all the talk so the guy who be with him talk with joe about different type of gun cost and everything after that be do the person who be do all the talk say now my friend mr straw be go to buy this gun he give mr straw the money mr straw buy the gun and the dealer write down mr straw s name for the fifteenth time that month his address do another instant check on it what sense do that make you still have not explain what purpose be serve by obtain the name of the straw purchaser and do an instant check on the straw purchaser you say that it allow the tracing of the weapon but that be not go to be true in the case of a straw purchaser because the person the straw purchaser be not necessarily and probably in the vast majority of case be not go to get the name or any information about the actual recipient that be the whole purpose of have a straw purchaser so then what purpose be serve by this it be just meaningless so they find the gun dealer and the gun dealer say i sell it to mr straw and then they go to mr straw and mr straw say my client take it okay who be your client i have no idea he come into my store he contact me i do not ask his name he do not give me his name and that be the end of it so no purpose be serve by put down the name the address do the check on the straw purchaser well what you be say be they do a meaningless thing that be the compromise they would do something that be utterly meaningless if we disagree with you on the first point about the straw purchaser would you would you lose on the ground that mr abramski s uncle could not have lawfully purchase the gun at that store because he be not a resident of the state but he could not have take possession of it in in pennsylvania in virginia but would it have be a lawful sale if the gun have be deliver to him on the spot yes he could not mr abramski be out of the picture and the uncle go in buy the gun put down a pennsylvania address the dealer give him the gun and walk out of the store that would that be a lawful sale well i mean my hypothetical so he do not have he do not put it in the yellow page and he do not put it on the internet he just hang around in the parking lot at joe s to accommodate people who and joe s be near the border and he want to accommodate people who may take it who wish to employ him as a straw purchaser well if we agree with you on the on the second argument would the government have to prove that the person to whom the straw purchaser transfer the gun be ineligible or would it be a defense if it be show that the person be eligible ,223.07,Roberts Court,"Jan 22, 2014",Bruce J.

2013,Wood v. Moss,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, can I ask you a question? No, no. It's certainly not your fault. [Laughter] This question about the -- the issue that you've been addressing in response to Justice Scalia's question. In -- in the Fourth Amendment context where it is purely -- the inquiry is purely objective, we have case law on what is reasonable suspicion, what is probable cause. Now, if you apply that to a First Amendment case where there -- where it's asserted that there is a security -- there may or may not be a security concern, would it not be necessary for us to identify a -- a degree of suspicion or probable cause that the Secret Service would have to have before making -- before moving people for security reasons? I imagine whenever the President is out in public, there is some degree of risk. You want no risk? You know, keep him in a bunker. So at some point -- do you see what I'm saying? They-- --The Secret Service has to make a decision about how much information they need before they can -- they should move people or change a route or something like that. So the courts would then have to set that standard. Well, what about the other situation, which is similar to your case but not exactly similar -- not exactly the same. You don't plead any evidence of direct intent -- any direct evidence of intent on the part of the officers, but you have two groups. One's pro, one's anti, and the officers put one group one place and one group the other place. Now, the distance from the President to the two groups is not the same. One is somewhat closer, one is somewhat farther away. The -- the things that are in between the group and the President are different. Maybe in the group that's further away, you might think the things are -- they might -- one might think that there are fewer obstructions, maybe there are more obstructions on the other side. So you plead that the -- the placement of the anti-group was less favorable than placement of the pro-group and is that enough? What more do you need? Well, you -- you plead intent. Would you be -- if you pled intent based just on the disparate impact, would you be in violation of Rule 11? What more would you need? What -- then what does happen if a district court does allow discovery of things what the Secret Service thinks are confidential? Under certain -- how far should demonstrators be away from the President? How high must a fence be before we think that it provides security against a thrown object? Suppose the district court allows discovery of all of that. What are they supposed to do? They have to file a mandamus petition with the court of appeals and get -- have the court of appeals -- try to persuade the court of appeals to review a discovery order? Just out of curiosity, was there anything to prevent someone from leaving one these groups and going over to the other group? Somebody couldn't have just walked away and taken a circuitous route and gone to the other group? That would have been -- the police would have stopped them from doing that? ",well can i ask you a question no no it be certainly not your fault laughter this question about the the issue that you have be address in response to justice scalia s question in in the fourth amendment context where it be purely the inquiry be purely objective we have case law on what be reasonable suspicion what be probable because now if you apply that to a first amendment case where there where it be assert that there be a security there may or may not be a security concern would it not be necessary for us to identify a a degree of suspicion or probable because that the secret service would have to have before make before move people for security reason i imagine whenever the president be out in public there be some degree of risk you want no risk you know keep him in a bunker so at some point do you see what I be say they the secret service have to make a decision about how much information they need before they can they should move people or change a route or something like that so the court would then have to set that standard well what about the other situation which be similar to your case but not exactly similar not exactly the same you do not plead any evidence of direct intent any direct evidence of intent on the part of the officer but you have two group one s pro one s anti and the officer put one group one place and one group the other place now the distance from the president to the two group be not the same one be somewhat close one be somewhat farther away the the thing that be in between the group and the president be different maybe in the group that be further away you might think the thing be they might one might think that there be few obstruction maybe there be more obstruction on the other side so you plead that the the placement of the anti group be less favorable than placement of the pro group and be that enough what more do you need well you you plead intent would you be if you plead intent base just on the disparate impact would you be in violation of rule what more would you need what then what do happen if a district court do allow discovery of thing what the secret service think be confidential under certain how far should demonstrator be away from the president how high must a fence be before we think that it provide security against a thrown object suppose the district court allow discovery of all of that what be they suppose to do they have to file a mandamus petition with the court of appeal and get have the court of appeal try to persuade the court of appeal to review a discovery order just out of curiosity be there anything to prevent someone from leave one these group and go over to the other group somebody could not have just walk away and take a circuitous route and go to the other group that would have be the police would have stop them from do that ,187.08,Roberts Court,"Mar 26, 2014",Tim Wood et al.,Michael Moss et al.,13-115,"Nov 26, 2013","May 27, 2014",112,1.0,1.0,0.0,1
2013,Harris v. Quinn,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, Mr. Messenger, I'm confused by this whole line of argumentation. I didn't think there was any issue in this case about the right of the plaintiffs or any of the other affected workers to say whatever they want on their own. That -- they're not prohibited from doing that, are they? So there isn't any issue about that in the case. I thought the issue -- and they can try to -- to meet with anybody they want as many times as they want. I suppose that -- that person has a perfect right to say: Enough is enough; I don't want to meet with you for the fifth or for the first time. I thought the issue was whether they could be required to pay for somebody else to go and speak and possibly say things that they disagree with. Mr. Messenger, do you think the issue of exclusive representation is inextricably tied to the issue of the assessment of an agency fee? Can't you have the former without the latter? I thought the State took the position that these individuals are State employees for one purpose only, collectively bargaining. Isn't that their position. So if one of these individuals commits gross misconduct, causes the death of a patient, the State has no liability? Mr. Smith, what I don't understand is why the union's participation in this is essential. The State can say, this is how much these people are being paid, it's not enough, we want to increase it, we want to increase it by 10 percent, 20 percent, 30 percent, whatever it is. They need some -- they should have extra benefits. Well, we'll give them these benefits and these benefits and these benefits. Why do they need to have the union intervene here? Well, that's fine for the workers who want the union to represent them in making these demands. Let me give you this example, which I think gets to what the plaintiffs in this case find disturbing. Let's say this is -- this involves the a teachers union. So the teachers union is negotiating about the issue of tenure and merit pay, and the union is opposed to any change in the tenure system, it's opposed to merit pay. Now, there's a teacher who's not a member of the union who disagrees completely with the union on these issues, but this teacher -- and the teacher is not a member of the union, but still has to pay a pretty hefty agency fee, maybe $700 a year. So the teacher is paying this money to the union to make an argument to the employer with which the teacher completely disagrees. Now, if this teacher just wants to get back to a neutral position, the teacher is going to have to spend $700 or maybe $500 of his or her own money, pay that to another organization that will present that teacher's point of view to the employer. How can that be -- what would you say to that, to that teacher? That, you know, You have a right to be -- You have a right to say whatever you want on these issues, but you don't have a right to be a teacher? Mr. Smith, are you saying that this -- that the unions reluctantly accept the duty of being the exclusive representative for all the employees? They don't really want to do this, but the law requires them to do this, but because the law requires them to do this then they have to get this agency fee? Is that really -- is that realistically what happens? Seriously, the unions do not want to have the -- they don't want to be given the status of the exclusive bargaining agent for the employees? What about the issue of-- --Well, let me ask you a question about pensions. Now, that's a very big public policy issue. I think in Illinois, the legislature recently cut pensions of -- of public employees. That would be a subject -- that could be a subject of -- of collective bargaining, right? So that would be -- bargaining on that would be chargeable? Well, if the -- if the union spends a lot of money trying to bargain on that issue, that's -- that's a chargeable expense, is it not? All right. Now, what do you say to the young employee who is not very much concerned at this point about pensions, but realizes there's a certain pot of money, and it's either going to go for pensions or it's going to go for salary at the present time. So that employee who's not a member of the union has to pay for the union to bargain with the -- the State to achieve something that's contrary to that person's interest. But you say that person is a free rider. If the plaintiffs in this case were to be unionized -- excuse me -- in a unionized Federal workplace, would they be assessed a mandatory agency fee? So the Federal Government doesn't think that it needs to assess a mandatory agency fee from, let's say, the employees in the Border Patrol. In order to make sure that the Border Patrol has high morale, sufficient salary, sufficient benefits, it can do without the agency fee in that situation? Do you think that the specific factual background of what occurred here provides a basis for skepticism about Illinois's reason for adopting this? I thought the situation was that Government Blagojevich got a huge campaign contribution from the union and virtually as soon as he got into office he took out his pen and signed an executive order that had the effect of putting, what was it, $3.6 million into the union coffers? That's the sequence; isn't that correct? Is it true that from -- from the beginning, there have been members of this Court who have questioned whether there is any principled basis for distinguishing between the chargeable and the nonchargeable expenses and also have questioned whether as a practical matter that can be done? Justice Marshall made that argument, did he not? ",well mr messenger I be confuse by this whole line of argumentation i do not think there be any issue in this case about the right of the plaintiff or any of the other affected worker to say whatever they want on their own that they be not prohibit from do that be they so there be not any issue about that in the case i think the issue and they can try to to meet with anybody they want as many time as they want i suppose that that person have a perfect right to say enough be enough i do not want to meet with you for the fifth or for the first time i think the issue be whether they could be require to pay for somebody else to go and speak and possibly say thing that they disagree with mr messenger do you think the issue of exclusive representation be inextricably tie to the issue of the assessment of an agency fee can not you have the former without the latter i think the state take the position that these individual be state employee for one purpose only collectively bargaining be not that their position so if one of these individual commits gross misconduct cause the death of a patient the state have no liability mr smith what i do not understand be why the union s participation in this be essential the state can say this be how much these people be be pay it be not enough we want to increase it we want to increase it by percent percent percent whatever it be they need some they should have extra benefit well we will give them these benefit and these benefit and these benefit why do they need to have the union intervene here well that be fine for the worker who want the union to represent them in make these demand let me give you this example which i think get to what the plaintiff in this case find disturbing let us say this be this involve the a teacher union so the teacher union be negotiate about the issue of tenure and merit pay and the union be oppose to any change in the tenure system it be oppose to merit pay now there be a teacher who be not a member of the union who disagree completely with the union on these issue but this teacher and the teacher be not a member of the union but still have to pay a pretty hefty agency fee maybe a year so the teacher be pay this money to the union to make an argument to the employer with which the teacher completely disagree now if this teacher just want to get back to a neutral position the teacher be go to have to spend or maybe of his or her own money pay that to another organization that will present that teacher s point of view to the employer how can that be what would you say to that to that teacher that you know you have a right to be you have a right to say whatever you want on these issue but you do not have a right to be a teacher mr smith be you say that this that the union reluctantly accept the duty of be the exclusive representative for all the employee they do not really want to do this but the law require them to do this but because the law require them to do this then they have to get this agency fee be that really be that realistically what happen seriously the union do not want to have the they do not want to be give the status of the exclusive bargaining agent for the employee what about the issue of well let me ask you a question about pension now that be a very big public policy issue i think in illinois the legislature recently cut pension of of public employee that would be a subject that could be a subject of of collective bargaining right so that would be bargain on that would be chargeable well if the if the union spend a lot of money try to bargain on that issue that be that be a chargeable expense be it not all right now what do you say to the young employee who be not very much concern at this point about pension but realize there be a certain pot of money and it be either go to go for pension or it be go to go for salary at the present time so that employee who be not a member of the union have to pay for the union to bargain with the the state to achieve something that be contrary to that person s interest but you say that person be a free rider if the plaintiff in this case we be to be unionized excuse me in a unionized federal workplace would they be assess a mandatory agency fee so the federal government do not think that it need to assess a mandatory agency fee from let us say the employee in the border patrol in order to make sure that the border patrol have high morale sufficient salary sufficient benefit it can do without the agency fee in that situation do you think that the specific factual background of what occur here provide a basis for skepticism about illinois s reason for adopt this i think the situation be that government blagojevich get a huge campaign contribution from the union and virtually as soon as he get into office he take out his pen and sign an executive order that have the effect of put what be it million into the union coffer that be the sequence be not that correct be it true that from from the beginning there have be member of this court who have question whether there be any principled basis for distinguish between the chargeable and the

2013,Chadbourne and Parke LLP v. Troice,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, in Justice -- Justice Kagan's hypothetical and in some of the others, it seems that it's really irrelevant in whether the assets in question are securities or some other asset. And it's also -- and, therefore, a fortiori it's irrelevant whether if it involves securities, whether they're covered or they're not covered. Now, would you be willing to concede that in that situation, where it really -- all you're talking about is an asset. It doesn't matter whether it's a covered security or a -- a Rembrandt or gold, that in that situation 10(b) doesn't reach the case? Does it matter that there -- apparently, that there is not an allegation that there actually were any purchases or sales of covered securities? It says in -- the statute says, ""in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security. "" And there weren't. I don't believe there's an allegation that they actually were purchased or sold. Does that matter? What's your best case on that? Can I take you back to the test that you think we should apply here? The test that Mr. Clement articulated and that you agreed with seems to amount to -- to saying, when exactly what is alleged here is alleged, that that's within 10b or 10b-5, that's not that helpful as a precedent going forward. Now, the test that Justice Breyer suggested, whether something would affect investors' confidence in the securities market, I don't know how we can -- and you say, yes, this would -- that would be met here -- I don't know how we can determine what -- whether something, certainly of this nature or maybe even further removed, would in effect -- would affect investor confidence. Somebody might read about this scheme in the paper and say, well, you know, there's a lot of hanky panky going on with the sale of any kind of securities and CDs, I'm just going to keep cash under my mattress. How do we -- how would we determine that? I don't understand what the first textual flaw is. What is the jumping off point for this flaw? Right. Well, everybody -- the case proceeds on the assumption that the -- that the CDs were not covered securities. The question is whether it's -- the “ in connection with ” requirement is met by the allegation, which is interpreted to mean that there would be future purchases and sales of covered securities. So I'm not sure what you're getting out of the fact that covered securities is a -- is a defined term. It doesn't say a misrepresentation about the covered security. It says, “ a misrepresentation in connection with ”. Well, all that's in the text of the statute is “ in connection with ”, which is open-ended. So I don't know what you're going to get from the text of the statute. Can I just be clear on your -- your position on the issue of whether there has to be an actual purchase or sale? What is your answer? Yes, there must be or no, it's not essential? You don't want us to decide the case on that basis? You don't want us to issue an opinion that says there has to be a purchase or sale, and therefore, affirm. Well, if we decided the case on that basis, it really would be a one-off. So the SEC today has told us this would have an effect on the securities market. But we would hold -- we won't listen to that because at an earlier point in the case as interpreted by you, they said it wouldn't. So that would be -- that would be the holding where, you know, because the SEC previously said it wouldn't be an effect on the securities market, that's the reason for the decision. ",well in justice justice kagan s hypothetical and in some of the others it seem that it be really irrelevant in whether the asset in question be security or some other asset and it be also and therefore a fortiori it be irrelevant whether if it involve security whether they be cover or they be not cover now would you be willing to concede that in that situation where it really all you be talk about be an asset it do not matter whether it be a covered security or a a rembrandt or gold that in that situation b do not reach the case do it matter that there apparently that there be not an allegation that there actually we be any purchase or sale of covered security it say in the statute say in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security and there be not i do not believe there be an allegation that they actually we be purchase or sell do that matter what be your best case on that can i take you back to the test that you think we should apply here the test that mr clement articulate and that you agree with seem to amount to to say when exactly what be allege here be allege that that be within b or b that be not that helpful as a precedent go forward now the test that justice breyer suggest whether something would affect investor confidence in the security market i do not know how we can and you say yes this would that would be meet here i do not know how we can determine what whether something certainly of this nature or maybe even far remove would in effect would affect investor confidence somebody might read about this scheme in the paper and say well you know there be a lot of hanky panky go on with the sale of any kind of security and cd I be just go to keep cash under my mattress how do we how would we determine that i do not understand what the first textual flaw be what be the jump off point for this flaw right well everybody the case proceeds on the assumption that the that the cd we be not covered security the question be whether it be the in connection with requirement be meet by the allegation which be interpret to mean that there would be future purchase and sale of covered security so I be not sure what you be get out of the fact that covered security be a be a defined term it do not say a misrepresentation about the covered security it say a misrepresentation in connection with well all that be in the text of the statute be in connection with which be open end so i do not know what you be go to get from the text of the statute can i just be clear on your your position on the issue of whether there have to be an actual purchase or sale what be your answer yes there must be or no it be not essential you do not want us to decide the case on that basis you do not want us to issue an opinion that say there have to be a purchase or sale and therefore affirm well if we decide the case on that basis it really would be a one off so the sec today have tell us this would have an effect on the security market but we would hold we will not listen to that because at an early point in the case as interpret by you they say it would not so that would be that would be the hold where you know because the sec previously say it would not be an effect on the security market that be the reason for the decision ,201.12,Roberts Court,"Oct 7, 2013",Chadbourne and Parke LLP,Samuel Troice et al.,12-79,"Jan 18, 2013","Feb 26, 2014",112,0.0,0.0,0.0,1

2013,Prado Navarette v. California,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Excuse me. I'm sorry. Could I ask you what you mean by an anonymous tip? Suppose somebody calls up 911 and gives a name? Does that make it not an anonymous tip? Well, how would you corroborate it? Let's say the person calls up and gives a name and gives an address? So what would be necessary? What would the police have to do then before they could stop the vehicle other than observing the vehicle do something illegal? If we transport the standard that applies outside of the vehicle context to this context, what would happen in this situation? A person calls up and says, This is my name, this is my address and it's, it's not blocked by caller ID, so the 911 operator can see that that's the name, that's the address. The person says: This guy ran me off the road. The police find the vehicle. They drive behind the vehicle for a while. They don't -- they don't see any -- they don't see any violation. So then they think, well, this guy must have lied. So are they are going to prosecute the guy for calling that in? I mean, your argument goes well beyond. You're saying this has to do with anonymous tips, but it really goes well beyond anonymous tips. It covers tips where you know exactly who called in, and what you're saying is they really can never stop a vehicle no matter what kind of a tip they get, unless they see the vehicle committing an illegal act. That's the argument. Give me an example of a situation in which the police can pull somebody over after receiving a tip without actually seeing the vehicle commit an illegal act? Well, how would somebody -- how would somebody ever be able -- who observes another car driving ever be able to say that person was drunk? All they could -- all they could observe is what they see. They don't know whether the person -- what is causing that kind of behavior. Well, why is it limited to drunk driving? I don't understand that. I've been -- I've been on an expressway, and I've had people go by me at -- they went by in a blur. They must have been going well over a hundred miles an hour. Now, if the police catch up with that person, of course, the person's going to slow down while the police follow the person. And then when the police decide to stop, they're going to go back to engaging in this intentional, extremely dangerous conduct. So I don't understand why there's a distinction between reporting that somebody necessarily is driving erratically, so the person may be impaired, and somebody who is -- where you have extremely reckless driving that's intentional. Well, I find that unsatisfactory because if you -- unless you're willing to say it doesn't matter whether it's a bomb, an atomic bomb, a little bomb, then there -- there must be -- if you're going to draw the line someplace, then you're going to have to distinguish between those reports of crimes that are serious enough to be on one side of the line and those reports of a crime that are not serious enough to be on that side of the line. You either have to go all the way, or you have to draw a line, and if you're going to draw a line, I would like to know where the line is. All right. Forget about reasonable suspicion. Just can it be done? You can say it can never done, even if it's an atomic bomb, even if it's some other type of bomb. You can say that. Or you can say, no, there's a line someplace. If you're going to say there's a line someplace, then, really, I think you need to tell us where the line is. For a bomb. For any kind of a bomb? It has to be a big bomb.

Well, do you -- do you know what the -- the median net worth of a household in the United States is? It's less than $70,000. So the question here is not whether he's going to be a ward of the State. The question is whether he's going to be above the median in his assets. What was -- what was the trustee supposed to do? Suppose the trustee has a meter running on -- on his desk, and he's hot in pursuit of this phantom Lily Lin of China, but we get -- we get to the point where he's down to the -- he says, well, if I do any more work, the only way I'm going to get paid is out of the $75,000.

In the Malley case, Justice Souter said that if this is not what Section 105(a) was intended for, it's hard to see what Section 501(a) was intended for. I take it you just think he's flatly wrong. So you're saying a creditor could not have objected when your client claimed the exemption on the ground that the exemption is going to prevent the discovery -- the disclosure of the fraudulent nature of this mortgage. The creditor could not have objected to the exemption on that basis? And why is that? Well, Mr. Hellman said that the creditor and, I guess, any other party could not object to the exemption on the ground that the house was burdened with a fraudulent mortgage. Do you agree with that?

You're just saying when the Senate acts, in your view, irresponsibly and refuses to confirm nominations, then the President must be able to fill those -- fill those positions. That's what you're arguing. I don't see what that has to do with whether the Senate is in session. Well, there's no practice -- there is no long practice of doing it. There is also no long practice of rejecting it. But if I could take you back to that, you said that the pro forma sessions may violate the Adjournment Clause in the Twentieth Amendment. Would you also say that they violate the Presentment Clause, because the Senate has passed legislation during these pro forma sessions and the President has signed that legislation. But where does this 3-day rule-- --Well, what is significant is whether they're available to confirm nominees; isn't that right? So suppose they say, instead of no business will be conducted, no nominations will be considered. Well, I know it would be a different case, but-- --So what? The point of the question is whether they're available to consider nominations. So if they say, we'll do other business, but no nominations will be considered, why isn't it exactly the same for purposes of the Recess Appointments Clause? Can I ask you a variant of the question that Justice Scalia asked General Verrilli. Suppose we think that the language in the Constitution is perfectly clear in some respect, but that there is a 200-year-old consistent practice, agreement by the President, going back to Washington and by the Senate that the language actually means something else. What would we do in that situation? On the first question, does your argument depend on the fact that -- on the assumption that the -- the possibility of a lengthy intra-session break was never even contemplated by those who framed and -- and ratified the Constitution? Because if they had thought about that, there's a real chance the Senate may take a two-month break-- --over Christmas. Would there be any reason why they wouldn't have wanted the recess appointment power to apply there as well as at the end of the session? I'm -- I'm not sure I understand the answer. If the purpose is to permit the president to fill vacancies when the Senate is unavailable to consider nominations and the country would be harmed by having these offices vacant for a period of time, why would that not apply to any lengthy break, whether it's at the end of the session or in the middle of the session? And so if you're arguing that it only applies at the end of the session, doesn't that depend on the assumption that they never thought about the possibility that there would be a lengthy break in the middle of the session? Well, if we agree with you on the first question, then there either needs to either be a number or a functional test. And I don't know where the number would come from and I don't know how the functional test would play out, so maybe you could say just a word about that. With respect to the presence of that in the Adjournments Clause but the absence of any number in the Recess Appointments Clause, how do you explain that? ",well let me ask you about the premise a vacancy be something that begin at a particular point in time and then it continue for some period and i be try to think of some other thing that might fall into the same category one would be an appointment to a federal office so you we be appoint as solicitor general at a particular point in time and the appointment continue another example might be a marriage it happen at a particular point in time and it continue for a a period of time now would we say that your appointment as solicitor general be happen today and will happen again tomorrow and happen yesterday be that the way the english language be use but you be make a very very aggressive argument in favor of executive power now and it have nothing whatsoever to do with whether the senate be in session or not you be just say when the senate act in your view irresponsibly and refuse to confirm nomination then the president must be able to fill those fill those position that be what you be argue i do not see what that have to do with whether the senate be in session well there be no practice there be no long practice of do it there be also no long practice of reject it but if i could take you back to that you say that the pro forma session may violate the adjournment clause in the twentieth amendment would you also say that they violate the presentment clause because the senate have pass legislation during these pro forma session and the president have sign that legislation but where do this day rule well what be significant be whether they be available to confirm nominee be not that right so suppose they say instead of no business will be conduct no nomination will be consider well i know it would be a different case but so what the point of the question be whether they be available to consider nomination so if they say we will do other business but no nomination will be consider why be not it exactly the same for purpose of the recess appointment clause can i ask you a variant of the question that justice scalia ask general verrilli suppose we think that the language in the constitution be perfectly clear in some respect but that there be a year old consistent practice agreement by the president go back to washington and by the senate that the language actually mean something else what would we do in that situation on the first question do your argument depend on the fact that on the assumption that the the possibility of a lengthy intra session break be never even contemplate by those who frame and and ratify the constitution because if they have think about that there be a real chance the senate may take a two month break over christmas would there be any reason why they would not have want the recess appointment power to apply there as well as at the end of the session I be I be not sure i understand the answer if the purpose be to permit the president to fill vacancy when the senate be unavailable to consider nomination and the country would be harm by have these office vacant for a period of time why would that not apply to any lengthy break whether it be at the end of the session or in the middle of the session and so if you be argue that it only apply at the end of the session do not that depend on the assumption that they never think about the possibility that there would be a lengthy break in the middle of the session well if we agree with you on the first question then there either need to either be a number or a functional test and i do not know where the number would come from and i do not know how the functional test would play out so maybe you could say just a word about that with respect to the presence of that in the adjournment clause but the absence of any number in the recess appointment clause how do you explain that ,219.94,Roberts Court,"Jan 13, 2014",National Labor Relations Board,Noel Canning,12-1281,"Jun 24, 2013","Jun 26, 2014",112,0.0,1.0,0.0,0
2013,Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Mr. Keisler, do you really mean to say that the only difference between greenhouse gases and the air pollutants that Congress clearly had in mind when it enacted the Clean Air Act is that greenhouse gases don't have a localized effect? Isn't there also a big difference in that the quantity of greenhouse gases that are emitted by sources are much greater than the quantity of these other pollutants and that's why there's this discrepancy between the statutory threshold and the threshold that EPA has-- --substituted? Can I ask you this question about -- can I ask you this question about EPA's position? Because this is something I don't understand. On the one hand, EPA says that applying the statutory thresholds to greenhouse gases would transform the PSD program into something that would be unrecognizable to the Congress that enacted the program; isn't that right? On the other hand, EPA says, but that's what we're going to aim to achieve at some point down the road. And then they're never going to get to the statutory thresholds. I thought EPA said well, we're going to work toward that. Well, that's -- then I don't understand the position. If -- if applying the statutory thresholds makes the program unrecognizable, and yet that's what they're going to aim to do down the road, get to -- get to the statutory thresholds, will it become more recognizable at that point? Are greenhouse gases the only air pollutant for which EPA has the authority to change the statutory thresholds? But could it do -- could it do this for another pollutant, something other than any of the greenhouse gases? Here we have a statutory provision that has very specific numbers, and the agency has said these numbers are absurd. We're going to multiple them by 400. Now, in the entire history of Federal regulation what is the best example you can give us of an agency's doing something like that, where it has taken a statute with numbers and has crossed them out and written in the numbers that it likes? Isn't your argument Congress has acquiesced in that? I thought there was a very short time lag between EPA's assertion of the authority to regulate the ozone-depleting substances under the PSD program and the enactment of-- --So was it a full 2 years? General, I don't want to interrupt your summation, but on the -- let mejust ask this quick question. On the issue of what happens with a facility that is subject to the PSD program because of the emission of other pollutants, the Petitioners argue that the permitting process would be entirely different for greenhouse gases because it would make no sense to require monitoring of local air conditions and -- air conditions. It would make no sense to try to assess the effect of the emission of the greenhouse gases on the area in the region. Could you just give a quick response to that?

2013,Atlantic Marine Construction Company v. U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","In the Stewart case to which you just referred, the court said, ""The parties do not dispute that the district court properly denied the motion to dismiss the case for improper venue under 1406(a). "" because Respondent apparently does business in the Northern District of Alabama, which was not the jurisdiction specified in the forum selection clause. So what -- if we were to write an opinion in your favor, what would you suggest we say about that? Well, that's -- that's true, but it means that the entire discussion in Stewart is beside the point. The Court wrote a decision about an issue that really never should arise because the party seeking -- as you see it, the party seeking to enforce the forum selection clause should proceed under 1406. So Stewart said, well, if -- if you proceed under the wrong provision, this is how it should come out. It makes the whole decision essentially meaningless, doesn't it? I don't see how that would -- I don't see how that would work. You're -- this is the argument you made in your reply brief, that if this -- if the case had been filed in the jurisdiction specified in the forum selection clause, that court could nevertheless proceed under 1404(a) and transfer it back to the Western District of Texas, for example. That's -- that's your argument, right? In exceptional cases. But 1404(a) says that it can -- a case can be transferred to a district where it might have been brought. And your argument under 1406 is that they couldn't be brought in the Western District of Texas, that's a place where there's a wrong venue. May I ask about -- just go ahead. Can I ask you this about the Professor Sachs' argument? Doesn't it lead to the consequence -- doesn't it show that -- wouldn't it mean that Justice Scalia's dissent was correct in Stewart and the majority was wrong in Stewart? Because if this is -- if this is contractual -- suppose Ricoh in that case had moved -- had adopted -- had taken the approach that Professor Sachs has recommended and moved for summary judgment, 12(b)(6) or summary judgment; that would be a contract issue. It would be governed by Alabama law. Alabama law says the forum selection clause is no good. Well, the interests -- the interests of justice that the district court weighed almost all boiled down to the interests of your client. The inconvenience of witnesses. Well, Atlantic Marine, to the extent we're talking about their witnesses, they're not concerned about the inconvenience of having their witnesses go to -- to Norfolk. But your witnesses -- the other witnesses are your witnesses. So that's a factor that goes to your convenience. Compulsory process to produce witnesses, same thing. So what were the public interests that -- what were the interests that were weighed here that are not the interests of J. Crew? Well, if they're not your witnesses, then they're -- they're Atlantic Marine's witnesses. So why should that be -- why should the inconvenience of Atlantic Marine's witnesses be a factor that weighs against Atlantic Marine's position that the case should be tried in Norfolk? Who -- who is going to call these witnesses, you or Atlantic Marine? You do, so they're your witnesses. The fact that they don't work for you is -- is immaterial here. So let's say they're out of the picture. Now, what else -- what's left? What other public interests are involved? Is -- Texas contract law is so arcane that the judges in the Eastern District of Virginia can't figure it out? Is that right? Oh, okay. [Laughter] Well, if 1404 -- if the court-- --And what would be the authority for dismissing the case if it had specified the State court? If 1404 is the correct procedural route, why shouldn't the rule be something like this: Where there is a forum selection clause, the burden is on -- the burden of trying to establish venue in some other jurisdiction is on the party opposing the forum selection clause, not the party that's invoking the forum selection clause. And the only factors that can be considered against the forum selection clause to -- to result in an exceptional case where that wouldn't be honored are factors that have nothing to do with the convenience of the -- of the party that doesn't want it tried in -- in the selected forum or with the likelihood of success of the party that doesn't want it tried in the sel -- in the jurisdiction specified in the forum selection clause. So in your case, if there had been a hurricane that wiped out the courts of the Eastern District of Virginia for some period of time so no cases could be tried, or there was an incredible back load of cases there that would prevent the case from being tried, maybe that would be -- those would be something that might amount to an exceptional circumstance, but everything else is off the board. What's wrong with that? Well, why should that -- why should that be, where there's a forum selection clause?

2013,McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, I may have an overly suspicious mind, but I don't know. If I saw 100 PACs rise up and all of them said exactly the same thing, we're going to make contributions to the five most contested Senate -- the candidates in the five most contested Senate races, I would be suspicious. And maybe the FEC would also be suspicious that they didn't just all spring up independently. In Buckley, the Court sustained -- sustained aggregate limits. What has changed since Buckley? Those were all created by the dairy industry or by the Nixon campaign, is that correct? But we are talking here about -- we're talking here about campaign contributions. Isn't it illegal for a candidate to take campaign contributions and use it to buy a Maserati? Well, I don't see how that really gets to the point. What troubles me about your -- what troubles me about your argument, General Verrilli, and about the district court's opinion is that what I see are wild hypotheticals that are not obviously plausible or -- and lack, certainly lack any empirical support. Now, you've -- you've chosen to use the same hypothetical the district court used about the $3.5 million contribution that would be -- that could be given by a coordinate -- which involves all of the House candidates and all of the Senate candidates in a particular year getting together with all of the -- all of the parties' national party committees, plus all of the State party committees, and then -- and that's how you get up to the $3.5 million figure; isn't that right? Now, how -- how realistic is that? How realistic is it that all of the State party committees, for example, are going to get money and they're all going to transfer it to one candidate? For 49 of them, it's going to be a candidate who is not in their own State. And there are virtually no instances of State party committees contributing to candidates from another State. And the other part of it that seems dubious on its face is that all of the party -- all of the candidates for the House and the Senate of a particular party are going to get together and they are going to transfer money to one candidate. There really -- you cited in your brief the example -- best examples, I take it, of -- of contributions from some candidates to other candidates. They are very small. Isn't that true? Well, I don't understand that-- --Unless the money is transferred to -- you have to get it from the person who wants to corrupt to the person who is going to be corrupted. And unless the money can make it from A to B, I don't see where the quid pro quo argument is. I understand-- --These -- these aggregate limits might not all stand or fall together. Let -- just take this example, if you can just take a minute and walk me through this step by step. You have somebody who wants to corrupt a member of the House, and this person's strategy is to make contributions to multiple House candidates with the hope, the expectation, the plan that those candidates are going to transfer -- transfer the money to the -- the member that this person wants to corrupt. Now, how is that person going to accomplish that given the earmarking regulations, and -- and the limits on how much one member can contribute to another? Well, if you're -- I mean, if you're not going to defend the application of the aggregate limits in that situation, doesn't it follow that, as applied to that situation, these are -- these are unconstitutional? Well, then just explain to me how it's going to be done. The person gives to member A with the hope that member A is going to give it to member B. If the person even implies, when making the contribution to A, that person wants it to go to B, that's earmarked. So how is this going to be done? Well, they are making -- they are making the argument that there are -- that the regulations that already exist about transfers from one entity to another prevent a lot of what you're complaining -- what you're -- what you are worried about. But if they are not sufficient, they could be bolstered. The aggregate limits are a very blunt way of trying to get out -- get at the problem that you are -- that you are worried about. That's their argument. What -- are -- is that wrong? There is nothing more that could be done to prevent transfers from joint fundraising committees or from one member to another or from State parties to candidates? I just don't understand that. You mean at the time when the person sends the money to this hypothetical joint fundraising committee there is a corruption problem immediately, even though -- what if they just took the money and they burned it? That would be a corruption problem there? When does the corruption -- yes. When does the corruption occur? It occurs when it's transferred to -- to the person who has power and want -- and they want to corrupt.

So that argument is a strange argument, unless there's something really special about the attorney's fees context. And I guess that's your argument, there's something really special. But why should it? I mean, you've got a lot of money involved. Why should we say, this is collateral litigation, even though it involves millions of dollars more than the claim in many other types of cases? It can clarify what the law is. What's the difference between that situation and, let's say, deciding an issue of qualified immunity in a civil rights case or applying the -- applying EDPA in a habeas case? The court can say this is what the law is, and then after that as the second step determine whether a particular interpretation of the law was reasonable. You could do the same thing here. Well, I'm just wondering, if you put together the two arguments about what the standard should be and what the standard of review should be, whether there really is going to be any meaningful review of what district courts do in this situation. Maybe you could just describe for me what an appellate decision would look like, saying that applying the totality of the circumstances, the District Court abused its discretion in awarding or not awarding fees. What would an Appellate Court say? ",well you can make you can make that argument with respect to every legal issue that be raise on appeal well if you have to decide whether the low court be right that be a lot of work but if all you have to decide be whether the low court abuse its discretion in decide if the law mean what the low court say it mean that be a lot less work so that argument be a strange argument unless there be something really special about the attorney s fee context and i guess that be your argument there be something really special but why should it i mean you have get a lot of money involve why should we say this be collateral litigation even though it involve million of dollar more than the claim in many other type of case it can clarify what the law be what be the difference between that situation and let us say decide an issue of qualified immunity in a civil right case or apply the apply edpa in a habeas case the court can say this be what the law be and then after that as the second step determine whether a particular interpretation of the law be reasonable you could do the same thing here well I be just wondering if you put together the two argument about what the standard should be and what the standard of review should be whether there really be go to be any meaningful review of what district court do in this situation maybe you could just describe for me what an appellate decision would look like say that apply the totality of the circumstance the district court abuse its discretion in award or not awarding fee what would an appellate court say ,89.76,Roberts Court,"Feb 26, 2014","Highmark, Inc.","Allcare Management Systems, Inc.",12-1163,"Oct 1, 2013","Apr 29, 2014",112,1.0,1.0,1.0,1

2013,Burt v. Titlow,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Was the sentence that was ultimately imposed after the trial for the second-degree murder conviction within the guidelines, within the Michigan guidelines? What -- do you know what those guidelines were? Could you explain the procedural situation before the Michigan Court of Appeals? There was a motion by the Respondent for a remand to the trial court to create a record; is that -- that correct-- --on the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel? And so the -- the question that the court of appeals had to decide was whether the materials that were submitted by the Respondent were sufficient to justify the hearing. And the court of appeals, I gather, said they're not sufficient and cited, among other things or principally, the fact that the Respondent had claimed innocence, and that was the reason for the change of attorney. So the issue really wasn't -- that was before them was really not entitlement to relief, but in the course of deciding whether there should be a remand, they necessarily got to the issue of whether there was an entitlement to relief. Is that -- is that correct or do I not understand? What do you make of the fact that -- what do you make of the fact that at the change of plea hearing, the first attorney didn't mention the claim of innocence, only mentioned the fact that the sentence was above the guidelines? On the question of this -- of this sentence, what do you think were the range of reasonable sentences that could have been imposed in compliance with our recent decisions? You have -- you have the sentence that was offered before the trial, but that was predicated on, A, testimony, and B, not having to go to trial. And then you have the sentence that was imposed after the trial when there was no testimony and there was a trial. So what was the -- what do you think a trial court could reasonably do in that situation, just split the difference? Are you arguing that he -- he needed to be -- he needed to have enough material and to have familiarized himself enough with everything that's relevant to the case to be able to go to trial before he could move to have the -- the previous plea withdrawn? All right. Well, then I don't understand what the argument was. Isn't it -- is it unreasonable to read the Pierson affidavit -- and -- and you submitted that; isn't that correct? All right. --to read it to mean that there were discussions between Deputy Ott and Titlow, and Titlow said she wasn't guilty? Ott said, ""Well, if you are not guilty, you shouldn't plead guilty. "" ""I will refer you to an attorney. "" ""If you want me to, I could ask somebody to come and talk to me. "" That seems to be a direct quote from -- from Titlow. Isn't that -- so isn't it reasonable to read it that way? Who was the attorney at that stage? I take it, it wasn't the trial attorney because the -- a big part of the claim before the Michigan Court of Appeals was that the trial attorney was also ineffective. Who was it? And she's -- is she with your office or she's-- --But she was appointed. If that's the case-- --Your arguments seemed to be -- have had a head-on collision. If this is nothing but a manslaughter case, then why was -- what argument do you have that Toca was ineffective in saying, let's go to trial. So if you're convicted of manslaughter without the plea, you'll get your guidelines sentence on the manslaughter case? Well, that's not a manslaughter case. I thought you were just saying it's a manslaughter case. You have my head-- --You have my head spinning. I thought you were making the argument that there's nothing unfair about requiring acceptance of -- about the imposition of a manslaughter sentence because this was a manslaughter case. I thought you were making that argument. Did I misunderstand that? Can I ask you about Mr. -- Mr. Toca's ethical lapses? Are they -- do they have a legal significance in this case? In what sense is his credibility -- did his credibility figure in the decision of the Michigan Court of Appeals? What was submitted to the Michigan Court of Appeals? Not the -- I am not talking about the exhibits that were attached, but there was a motion, a brief? What was it? It's not in the habeas record, it's not in the record of the Federal Court.

2013,Heimeshoff v. Hartford Life & Accident Insurance Co.,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, ERISA doesn't have a statute of limitations, it doesn't specifically set out a statute of limitations for this type of claim. But it does have a savings clause that says it doesn't preempt State laws that regulate insurance. So what would happen in this situation? Let's say that a State statute says essentially what the plan at issue says. It says that a claim for the incorrect denial of insurance benefits must be brought within three years after the proof of loss. And now let's assume we agree with you, that under ERISA, any statute of limitations for the denial of benefits must begin not when the proof of loss must be filed, but upon the denial of benefits. Does it follow, then, that the rule that you're advocating would mean that ERISA preempted the State law that regulated insurance in the way that I just specified? Well, I think your answer to that question has to be yes; otherwise, the situation would be a mess. But I -- but in -- in what sense is the law that I hypothesize not a law that regulates insurance? So why wouldn't it fall within ERISA's savings clause? I find it very hard to answer the question that is presented here without knowing the answer to the preemption question that I asked Mr. Wessler. And I know you refer to it in a footnote in your brief and you say that this -- the type of State statute to which I referred would likely be preempted. And I can understand why you wouldn't want to go further than that on that question in a case where that question isn't squarely presented. But if it's not presented, then I think we would be creating an incredible mess that Congress would not have intended. So I really don't understand how I can answer the question here without knowing the answer to the question there. If we agree with you, would a State legislature have the authority to pass a statute setting out a particular -- a specific statute of limitations for ERISA claims? Why would -- why would employers with ERISA plans be hurt by the rule that the Petitioner is advocating going forward? Why wouldn't they just be then able to amend the plan, make the -- the period for filing suit begin on the -- at the end of the review process, shorten the period, if -- so as to bring it in line with basically what happened before, when the period began upon the proof of loss. I don't quite understand why, going forward, that is -- is a disadvantage to -- to employers? The current model being the proof of loss? And why is that preferable? Well, you started to answer this question before, but I'm not sure I understand the answer: Why this proof of loss model is -- is so attractive in the disability insurance field. You said that it provides a clear date on which you know you can begin to count. But so does an accrual rule. So maybe you can explain a little bit more. Right, right. Well, if we agree with you, would the Federal courts and maybe ultimately this Court in the end have to specify what the statute of limitations is, the length of time? So we have a bunch of cases from different courts, and one circuit says 2 years is -- is the -- that's the shortest you can have. Another one says, no, you can have a year. Another one says, well, you could have 9 months. How would this ultimately happen? Wouldn't we be driven to that? They specify a lot of different lengths, and then they're all challenged -- different ones are challenged in different courts, and the courts have to say what's reasonable. And there's no State statute of limitations that applies to this situation. So it all comes down just to a question of reasonableness. ",well erisa do not have a statute of limitation it do not specifically set out a statute of limitation for this type of claim but it do have a saving clause that say it do not preempt state law that regulate insurance so what would happen in this situation let us say that a state statute say essentially what the plan at issue say it say that a claim for the incorrect denial of insurance benefit must be bring within three year after the proof of loss and now let us assume we agree with you that under erisa any statute of limitation for the denial of benefit must begin not when the proof of loss must be file but upon the denial of benefit do it follow then that the rule that you be advocate would mean that erisa preempt the state law that regulate insurance in the way that i just specify well i think your answer to that question have to be yes otherwise the situation would be a mess but i but in in what sense be the law that i hypothesize not a law that regulate insurance so why would not it fall within erisa s saving clause i find it very hard to answer the question that be present here without know the answer to the preemption question that i ask mr wessler and i know you refer to it in a footnote in your brief and you say that this the type of state statute to which i refer would likely be preempt and i can understand why you would not want to go far than that on that question in a case where that question be not squarely present but if it be not present then i think we would be create an incredible mess that congress would not have intend so i really do not understand how i can answer the question here without know the answer to the question there if we agree with you would a state legislature have the authority to pass a statute set out a particular a specific statute of limitation for erisa claim why would why would employer with erisa plan be hurt by the rule that the petitioner be advocate go forward why would not they just be then able to amend the plan make the the period for file suit begin on the at the end of the review process shorten the period if so as to bring it in line with basically what happen before when the period begin upon the proof of loss i do not quite understand why go forward that be be a disadvantage to to employer the current model be the proof of loss and why be that preferable well you start to answer this question before but I be not sure i understand the answer why this proof of loss model be be so attractive in the disability insurance field you say that it provide a clear date on which you know you can begin to count but so do an accrual rule so maybe you can explain a little bit more right right well if we agree with you would the federal court and maybe ultimately this court in the end have to specify what the statute of limitation be the length of time so we have a bunch of case from different court and one circuit say year be be the that be the short you can have another one say no you can have a year another one say well you could have month how would this ultimately happen would not we be drive to that they specify a lot of different length and then they be all challenged different one be challenge in different court and the court have to say what be reasonable and there be no state statute of limitation that apply to this situation so it all come down just to a question of reasonableness ,216.85,Roberts Court,"Oct 15, 2013",Julie Heimeshoff,Hartford Life & Accident Insurance Co. and Walmart Stores,12-729,"Apr 15, 2013","Dec 16, 2013",112,0.0,1.0,0.0,0

What if it were the -- what if it were the case that there were very small number of people who were allergic to one of these ingredients? I'm not suggesting it's true. For all I know, it's not. But let's say there are a few people who are very allergic to pomegranate juice or blueberry juice. And so the FDA says, if you put even an eyedropper full of that in your blend, you have to put that prominently on the bottle so that these people will not inadvertently get an allergic reaction. Could you have a Lanham Act claim then? Well, what I'm saying is suppose it's the case that for 99.999 percent of the population, the more pomegranate juice, the better, you just can't drink enough of it. The more you drink, the healthier you are. But for this tiny percentage of the population, it could produce an allergic reaction. And so the FDA says, you've got to put that on there even if there is just a tincture of pomegranate juice. Could you have a Lanham Act claim on the ground for the vast majority of your potential customers, they are going to be misled, because they want pomegranate juice and they are buying this stuff that just has a little bit of it in it? What public health benefit is served by this regulation? This is what puzzles me about it.

2013,Riley v. California,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, Mr. Fisher, before we do that, have you been accurate in what you said about Robinson and about the Court's cases? In Weeks, which was quoted in Robinson, the Court said: ""The right, always recognized under English and American law, to search the person of the accused when legally arrested to discover and seize the fruits or evidences of crime. "" Is that historically inaccurate? Do you want us to repudiate that? Well, smartphones -- smartphones do present difficult problems. But let me ask you this: Suppose your client were an old-school guy and he didn't have -- he didn't have a cell phone. He had a billfold and he had photos that were important to him in the billfold. He had that at the time of arrest. Do you dispute the proposition that the police could examine the photos in his billfold and use those as evidence against him? Yes. What is the difference between looking at hardcopy photos in a billfold and looking at photos that are saved in the memory of a cell phone? Well, how does that apply -- how does that apply to these hardcopy photos in the billfold? They don't present a threat to anybody. And I don't see that there's much of a difference between -- the government argues there's a greater risk of the destruction of digital evidence in a cell phone than -- than there is in the photos. So I don't quite understand how -- how that applies to that situation. But do you think in this case we have to decide whether all the information that may be available in a smartphone can be examined by the police when the owner of the phone is arrested or can we just focus on the particular evidence that was admitted in your client's trial? What if the phone in this case was an old-fashioned flip-phone? So it had the capacity to take pictures, but a much more limited memory. Would it -- would it be a different case? What if the person had on his person a compact disk with photos saved on that? You could amend your answer and it's -- the answers are for you, not for us. But you could amend your answer to say not just anything that somebody could have had. The person could have had a diary that records every place the person has ever gone in the last year, it's theoretically possible. But you could say something that has a realistic analogue in the predigital era. We have a similar -- a problem here that's similar to the problem in the Jones GPS case. You have a rule of law that was established in the predigital era and now you have to apply it in the digital era or you're asked to apply it in the digital era where the technology changes a lot of things. But if there is a close analogue in the digital era to something that would have been allowed in the predigital era, that may be a different story. Does the owner of a cell phone have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the call log? But the cell phone company has all that information, doesn't it? Has the numbers. All right. Does the -- does the owner have a reasonable expectation of privacy in a list of the numbers called? The cell phone company won't have information about the length of the call? Well, what are we dealing with here? I know everybody wants to talk about global issues, but what -- what are the -- what information are we talking about in this case? We have my home, which you said is in plain view, my house, and then you have the call log. What else do we have? Well, if the call log, the numbers called, is not covered by a reasonable expectation of privacy, and my house is not covered by a reasonable expectation of privacy, then where is the search? And you could do that and look for a razor blade? Flip open the old style flip-phone to see if there's something inside? See the recent -- but what is -- where is -- what is the reason -- by pushing the button, you get information that you just told me is not covered by a reasonable expectation of privacy. Yes, but was any of that used here? Well, they saw the number -- they saw the phone rang at a particular time, and then if you look at the call log, you can see what call came in at that particular time. And then you know where the call came from that registered as my house. Why -- why is that something -- and maybe I don't understand the facts. If -- if a phone rang right now and you look at the call log and you see what call came in at 12:13, and you know that the call came from my house, and you see the number from -- of the call that came in at 12:13, wouldn't you know that that was the number from my house? In determining whether the examination of information on a cell phone is -- constitutes a search, what do you think we -- we are doing? Are we trying to -- to -- are we answering an empirical question, what is the reasonable expectation of privacy of a -- of a person in 2014 who has a cell phone in his or her -- on his or her person? Or are we legislating what we think is a good privacy rule? All right. Well, a lot of that -- part of that is the person must act -- people must actually have that expectation. That must be the expectation of people at large in 2014, that they think that everything that's on their cell phones is private, or they think some of the information on the cell phones is private, or they think nothing on the cell phone is private. Where do you think we should look to answer that question about what people in 2014 think about that question? But why is that so? Cell phones are different. I'm not going to say for a -- suggest for a second that there are like things that existed in the pre-digital area. But in the pre-digital era, presumably people didn't have a reasonable expectation of privacy in papers, letters, things like that that they had, of photos in a billfold, numbers, addresses, things that they might -- they might be carrying on their persons. So how do we determine what the -- what the new expectation of privacy is now? Then why was it not a search when -- when you -- you searched the pocket of somebody who was arrested and you found the address of someplace? All right. What was the -- why -- how do we determine whether something has -- somebody has a reasonable expectation of privacy in any category of information that is contained on a cell phone? Yeah, and that's the-- --No. I understand that. But that -- that's the question that I was asking before. Is it a reasonable search or seizure? All right. So you have to balance the privacy interest versus the law enforcement interest. And how do -- how do we find out what the privacy interests are -- what the privacy expectations are, which go into that balance with respect to cell phones in 2014? Does it matter? You think it doesn't matter? Maybe people feel very strongly every single thing that's in the cell phone is -- is private, or maybe they don't. Maybe they think some things are private; some things are not private. ",well mr fisher before we do that have you be accurate in what you say about robinson and about the court s case in week which be quote in robinson the court say the right always recognize under english and american law to search the person of the accuse when legally arrest to discover and seize the fruit or evidence of crime be that historically inaccurate do you want us to repudiate that

2013,Bond v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, don't you think the word “ treaty ” has some meaning?

One of the original purposes of -- objectives of the Constitution was to deal with -- with a treaty power was to deal with the issue of debts owed to British creditors. And there have been cases about the property rights of -- of foreign subjects, about the treatment of foreign subjects here, about things that are moving across international borders, about extradition and all of those. But in all of those, until fairly recently, certainly until generally after World War II, all of those concerned matters that are of legitimate concern of a foreign State. That was the purpose of a treaty. So can't we see something in that, in the meaning of a treaty, what it was understood to mean when the Constitution was adopted? And do you think it would be difficult-- --Do you think it would be difficult for a judge to ask, is there any possibility that there is any other country in the world that has the slightest interest in how the United States or any of its subdivisions deals with the particular situation that's involved in this case?

And -- and if that -- if they have a minor child, then the minor child would be a derivative. Benefit sharing. Suppose there are two -- suppose there are two lawful permanent residents who are exactly the same except that one has a minor child and one has an adult unmarried child.

2013,Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, could I ask you this, Mr. Clement. In -- in all the years since RFRA has been on the books, have any of these claims involving minimum wage, for example, been brought and have they succeeded? Are there ways of accommodating the interests of the women who may want these particular drugs or devices without imposing a substantial burden on the employer who has the religious objection to it? What are they? Well, is it your argument that providing the accommodation that's requested here would violate the Establishment Clause? Well, if you could start with the question of whether the -- the companies in this case have a right to bring RFRA claims because they're for-profit corporations. You argue that they can't. Now, why is that? Is it -- is it your position that there's something about the corporate form per se that is inconsistent with the free exercise claim? All right. But is it your argument that there's something about engaging in a for-profit activity that is inconsistent with a free exercise claim? Well, were the merchants in the Braunfeld case engaged in for-profit activity? So there isn't anything inherent in-- --in participating in a for-profit activity that's inconsistent with corporate form, is there? I'm sorry, with a free exercise claim. Well, what is it about-- --a for-profit corporation that is inconsistent with a free exercise claim? Do you agree with the proposition that was endorsed by one of the lower courts in this case, that for-profit corporations must do nothing but maximize profits, they cannot have other aims-- --including religious aims? And why did it tell-- --Why did it say that? It changed the definition at the time when RLUIPA was adopted, did it not, to eliminate the reference to the First Amendment; isn't that right? Well, it says free exercise. And didn't it also adopt a provision in RLUIPA saying that -- that the exercise of religion was to be interpreted in the broadest possible way? No. Didn't it say -- didn't it say the term ‶ religious exercise ″ includes any exercise-- --No. But there is another provision that says that, ""This chapter shall be construed in favor of a broad protection of religious exercise to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of this chapter and the Constitution. "" If you say they can't even get their -- they can't even get their -- their day in court, you're saying something pretty, pretty strong. Isn't it true with respect to the grandfathered plans that the regulations required immediate compliance with certain requirements, but not with preventive care requirements; isn't that right? Let me read you what HHS said in the regulation: ""With certain particularly significant protections, particularly significant protections, Congress required grandfathered health plans to comply with a subset of the Affordable Care Act's health reform provisions. "" ""On the other hand, grandfathered health plans are not required to comply with certain other requirements of the Affordable Care Act; for example, the requirement that preventive health services be covered without any cost sharing. "" So isn't HHS saying there, quite specifically, these, in our view, are not within this subset of particularly significant requirements as to which there must be immediate compliance? Well, we can ask Mr. Clement what his position is on this. But you say they have already asserted that it would be inconsistent with RFRA as they understand it to provide for a for-profit corporation, like the ones involved here, the sort of accommodation that HHS has extended to so-called religious nonprofits, perhaps with the modification that was included in our stay order in the Little Sisters case. Have they taken a position on that? I thought that -- I was taken by your answer. I thought it was the government's position that providing coverage for the full range of contraceptives and other devices and drugs that are covered here is actually financially neutral for an insurance company, that that reduces other costs that they would incur. No. No. If she -- if she has the coverage through the insurance company but the employer has nothing to do with arranging for that. Mr. -- General Verrilli, isn't that really a question of theology or moral philosophy, which has been debated for -- by many scholars and adherents to many religions. A does something that B thinks is immoral. How close a connection does there have to be between what B does that may have some -- that may provide some assistance to A in order for B to -- to be required to refrain from doing that -- that action. It is a religious question and it's a moral question. And you want us to provide a definitive secular answer to it? What about the implications of saying that no for-profit corporation can raise any sort of free exercise claim at all and nobody associated with the for-profit corporation can raise any sort of free exercise claim at all? Let me give you this example. According to the media, Denmark recently prohibited kosher and halal slaughter methods because they believe that they are inhumane. Now, suppose Congress enacted something like that here. What would the -- what would a corporation that is a kosher or halal slaughterhouse do? They would simply -- they would have no recourse whatsoever. They couldn't even get a day in court. They couldn't raise a RFRA claim. They couldn't raise a First Amendment claim. Why is that-- --Exactly. Well, they say no animal may be slaughtered unless it's stunned first, unless the animal is rendered unconscious before it is slaughtered. Isn't there a Federal program that pays for vaccines for any children who are not covered by insurance for those vaccines? ",well could i ask you this mr clement in in all the year since rfra have be on the book have any of these claim involve minimum wage for example be bring and have they succeed be there way of accommodate the interest of the woman who may want these particular drug or device without impose a substantial burden on the employer who have the religious objection to it what be they well be it your argument that provide the accommodation that be request here would violate the establishment clause well if you could start with the question of whether the the company in this case have a right to bring rfra claim because they be for profit corporation you argue that they can not now why be that be it be it your position that there be something about the corporate form per se that be inconsistent with the free exercise claim all right but be it your argument that there be something about engage in a for profit activity that be inconsistent with a free exercise claim well we be the merchant in the braunfeld case engage in for profit activity so there be not anything inherent in in participate in a for profit activity that be inconsistent with corporate form be there I be sorry with a free exercise claim well what be it about a for profit corporation that be inconsistent with a free exercise claim do you agree with the proposition that be endorse by one of the low court in this case that for profit corporation must do nothing but maximize profit they can not have other aim include religious aim and why do it tell why do it say that it change the definition at the time when rluipa be adopt do it not to eliminate the reference to the first amendment be not that right well it say free exercise and do not it also adopt a provision in rluipa say that that the exercise of religion be to be interpret in the broad possible way no do not it say do not it say the term religious exercise include any exercise no but there be another provision that say that this chapter shall be construe in favor of a broad protection of religious exercise to the maximum extent permit by the term of this chapter and the constitution if you say they can not even get their they can not even get their their day in court you be say something pretty pretty strong be not it true with respect to the grandfathered plan that the regulation require immediate compliance with certain requirement but not with preventive care requirement be not that right let me read you what hhs say in the regulation with certain particularly significant protection particularly significant protection congress require grandfathered health plan to comply with a subset of the affordable care act s health reform provisions on the other hand grandfathered health plan be not require to comply with certain other requirement of the affordable care act for example the requirement that preventive health service be cover without any cost sharing so be not hhs say there quite specifically these in our view be not within this subset of particularly significant requirement as to which there must be immediate compliance well we can ask mr clement what his position be on this but you say they have already assert that it would be inconsistent with rfra as they understand it to provide for a for profit corporation like the one involve here the sort of accommodation that hhs have extend to so call religious nonprofit perhaps with the modification that be include in our stay order in the little sister case have they take a position on that i think that i be take by your answer i think it be the government s position that provide coverage for the full range of contraceptive and other device and drug that be cover here be actually financially neutral for an insurance company that that reduce other cost that they would incur no no if she if she have the coverage through the insurance company but the employer have nothing to do with arrange for that mr general verrilli be not that really a question of theology or moral philosophy which have be debate for by many scholar and adherent to many religion a do something that b think be immoral how close a connection do there have to be between what b do that may have some that may provide some assistance to a in order for b to to be require to refrain from do that that action it be a religious question and it be a moral question and you want us to provide a definitive secular answer to it what about the implication of say that no for profit corporation can raise any sort of free exercise claim at all and nobody associate with the for profit corporation can raise any sort of free exercise claim at all let me give you this example accord to the medium denmark recently prohibit kosher and halal slaughter method because they believe that they be inhumane now suppose congress enact something like that here what would the what would a corporation that be a kosher or halal slaughterhouse do they would simply they would have no recourse whatsoever they could not even get a day in court they could not raise a rfra claim they could not raise a first amendment claim why be that exactly well they say no animal may be

2013,United States v. Apel,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, some military installations are located in very rural areas. Now, suppose you have an installation in such a place and there are buildings and -- and facilities that you can see in one part of this territory, but there's a lot of open -- there are a lot of open fields around it. Would -- and suppose there's -- it's not posted. Would that still be a military installation if somebody goes on that? Suppose that the Respondent in this case didn't want to protest. He just wanted to take a drive up to Santa Barbara or -- I don't know -- maybe it's -- I don't know -- if it's not illegal to walk in Southern California, maybe he wanted to walk along the Pacific Coast Highway. Would he -- would he commit a misdemeanor by doing that? Mr. Horwich, can I ask you this, which is -- this question is stimulated by what Justice Kagan asked. Is it -- my understanding is that, if you look at many military reservations, you may need a very detailed map to figure out -- and a crime is committed someplace on there or other Federal lands -- you may need a very detailed map to determine whether criminal jurisdiction over that particular offense is exclusively Federal or Federal and concurrent. Now -- and I would assume that that could be true of a military base that is completely sealed off to the public. Now, do you understand that the -- the Ninth Circuit's holding to be based on access or to be based on jurisdiction over crimes that are committed there? Well, there may be -- suppose property is leased to -- I don't know whether this actually ever occurs -- but suppose it's leased to the United States and used for a military reservation. Would there be exclusively Federal criminal jurisdiction there, or would there not be concurrent jurisdiction? Right. Could I just ask you what we should make of this -- what we should make of this green line? What is the significance of the green line? Really, Mr. Chemerinsky, I don't mean to interrupt your sentence. But, I mean, I may own a parcel of property, and I may put up a fence around my property, and I may not put the fence right at the very edge of the property. I may leave a little border between the edge of my property and the place where the fence is. Now, are you saying that I have ceded exclusive control over this area between the fence and the end of the property? What do you mean by, “ exclusive possession ”? Does the fence have any relevance? What is the relevance of the fence? But there are bases that have no fences. So what, there? None of that is under the exclusive possession of the government? I'm still completely confused about the test that you are asking us to -- to apply. Either -- either fences are relevant or they are not relevant. If you can have exclusive governmental -- exclusive military possession of a base where there are no fences, I don't really see what the significance is of the fence here. That's just -- that's just for starters. Well, you are arguing that the military cannot grant an easement across a military installation for the purpose of allowing the public to drive from a point, let's say, to the south to a point to the north, without also granting an easement that would allow people to linger along the road and engage in First Amendment activity. Is that your argument? Because I can understand why the military might be willing to say, well, fine, we understand that it would be very inconvenient to make everybody drive around the installation. We'll allow them to drive through, but we do not want people lingering here because that does create security concerns. ",well some military installation be locate in very rural area now suppose you have an installation in such a place and there be building and and facility that you can see in one part of this territory but there be a lot of open there be a lot of open field around it would and suppose there be it be not post would that still be a military installation if somebody go on that suppose that the respondent in this case do not want to protest he just want to take a drive up to santa barbara or i do not know maybe it be i do not know if it be not illegal to walk in southern california maybe he want to walk along the pacific coast highway would he would he commit a misdemeanor by do that mr horwich can i ask you this which be this question be stimulate by what justice kagan ask be it my understanding be that if you look at many military reservation you may need a very detailed map to figure out and a crime be committed someplace on there or other federal land you may need a very detailed map to determine whether criminal jurisdiction over that particular offense be exclusively federal or federal and concurrent now and i would assume that that could be true of a military base that be completely seal off to the public now do you understand that the the ninth circuit s holding to be base on access or to be base on jurisdiction over crime that be commit there well there may be suppose property be lease to i do not know whether this actually ever occur but suppose it be lease to the united state and use for a military reservation would there be exclusively federal criminal jurisdiction there or would there not be concurrent jurisdiction right could i just ask you what we should make of this what we should make of this green line what be the significance of the green line really mr chemerinsky i do not mean to interrupt your sentence but i mean i may own a parcel of property and i may put up a fence around my property and i may not put the fence right at the very edge of the property i may leave a little border between the edge of my property and the place where the fence be now be you say that i have cede exclusive control over this area between the fence and the end of the property what do you mean by exclusive possession do the fence have any relevance what be the relevance of the fence but there be base that have no fence so what there none of that be under the exclusive possession of the government I be still completely confuse about the test that you be ask us to to apply either either fence be relevant or they be not relevant if you can have exclusive governmental exclusive military possession of a base where there be no fence i do not really see what the significance be of the fence here that be just that be just for starter well you be argue that the military can not grant an easement across a military installation for the purpose of allow the public to drive from a point let us say to the south to a point to the north without also grant an easement that would allow people to linger along the road and engage in first amendment activity be that your argument because i can understand why the military might be willing to say well fine we understand that it would be very inconvenient to make everybody drive around the installation we will allow them to drive through but we do not want people linger here because that do create security concern ,207.5,Roberts Court,"Dec 4, 2013",United States,John D.

2013,McCullen v. Coakley,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Does the record show how many clinics in the State are covered by the law? In one of the examples that is given in one of the amicus briefs in this case, and they -- they provide a lot of background, is a State law that creates a buffer zone around every fraternal lodge. What would you say about that? Well, they haven't entirely eliminated speech because employees are permitted-- --to speak within the scope of their employment; isn't that right? May I ask you a question about a distinction that is in this statute? Now, let me give you this -- this example. A woman is approaching the door of a clinic, and she enters the zone. Two other women approach her. One is an employee of the facility, the other is not. The first who is an employee of the facility says, good morning. This is a safe facility. The other one who's not an employee says, good morning, this is not a safe facility. Now, under this statute, the first one has not committed a crime; the second one has committed a crime. And the only difference between the two is that they've expressed a different viewpoint. One says it's safe; one says it's not safe. Now, how can a statute like that be considered viewpoint-neutral? Well, that's what she -- what she's doing is what she's saying. She approaches and she says this is a safe facility. The other one says it's not a safe facility. They have a bad safety record. And they're -- they're the only people in the zone. If it's as big as this courtroom, they're the only three people in that zone. The difference is a viewpoint difference. Well, you could have created a completely silent zone. Now, I don't know whether that would be permissible or not, but it would be a different question. You could have -- you could say nobody can speak here. People can shovel snow. If they work for the -- for the clinic, they can sweep the sidewalk, they can do maintenance, they can go in and they -- and out, but they can't utter a word. Well, that would be a different statute. But that's not this statute. This statute says that there is an exemption for employees of the facility if they are operating within the scope of their employment. And surely coming out and saying this is a safe facility is within the scope of their employment. So how do you justify that? Forget about the conduct now. The speech that's allowed. One can speak and say it's safe. The other cannot speak and say it is not safe. You think it's incidental? What if there's a real question about whether this is a safe facility? That's incidental speech? Well, before you sit down, can I ask you this question that's suggested by the AFL-CIO briefs. Suppose the State legislature has hearings, and they say there's a long history of violence and obstruction at sites where there is a strike and replacement workers have been called in. Could the -- could a State pass a statute that says there is a 35-foot zone like this around every location in the State whenever there is a strike and there are replacement workers? Could they do that? All right. Could Federal law do that? In every case, in every case-- --there could just be a flat rule. Doesn't matter whether there is any history at that place, any indication there's going to be violence. Maybe there will, maybe there won't. Across the board, a zone around every place where there's a strike. You don't think there's a history -- you don't think there's a history of violence at places where there are strikes and replacement workers? That's not my understanding of the labor history. Well, how far do you think -- what do you think a State legislature or Congress needs to find in order to establish a zone around some category of facility at which there -- they have some evidence that there have been some disruptions and some obstruction? Take the example of -- I think it's -- it's a real -- real ordinance someplace you can't have, there's a buffer zone around fraternal lodges. What would they have to find? Or slaughterhouses. Or labor -- or sites where there are strikes. What kind of a record do they need? Could -- could there be a State law that says no picketing around any -- you can never have a picket around any store to try to prevent people -- to tell people don't go -- don't patronize this store. Could they do that? Isn't that Thornhill v. Alabama? Right. Well, I mean, I understand. Stop. I'll ask this one more time. I think it's -- I understand the -- the desire to create a buffer zone around certain sensitive facilities. What I'm asking is: What requirements, if any, does Congress or a State legislature have to meet before they can do that? If it is done, do we simply say they -- they have a rational basis for it and that's it, so they can establish basically a buffer zone around any kind of a facility they want. If not, then what needs to be established? One more thing. What about the example of a strike? There certainly is a long history of labor violence in places where there are replacement workers. Could that -- could it be done in that situation across the board?

They're all covered? Well, if doesn't-- --If it doesn't include that, then -- then how do you avoid that with your reading of the text? Well, to go back to Justice Breyer's hypothetical which gets at this point where you have the gardening -- the gardening company, privately held, that's working for a public company, and there's some kind of employee of the contractor is fired and claims that the company is engaging in some kind of fraud that has nothing to do with the public company. So you have that situation. Now you have the identical, another privately held gardening company, exactly the same thing is going on, except they don't have a contract with a public company. Why would Congress have wanted to cover the former and not the latter? But why? If they are concerned with all fraud, why not cover them both? It's not -- it's not unlikely that an employee of a subcontractor will have information about something that can be -- that can be alleged to be mail fraud by that -- by the contractor, that's not at all unlikely. If you see -- you know, if you see some civil RICO complaints, you see the kind of things that are alleged as mail fraud. Do you disagree with that? Yes. But you think this is limited to -- to fraud by the contractor relating to the public company, not -- not fraud that has nothing to do with the public company. What do you mean while? Temporal -- during the same period of time or in relation to? And where do you see that in the statute? It says, 〝 The contractor of such company ″, not 〝 the fraud of such company ″. What happens if another Enron situation comes along and the corporation's accounting firm retaliates against an employee of the accounting firm because that employee wants to report illegal activity by the corporation? What the statute says is 〝 any conduct ″, ""any conduct which the employee reasonably believes constitutes a violation of Section 1341, '43, '44, or '48. "" Do you see in there any limitation that says that the conduct has to be fraudulent conduct relating to the activities of a publicly held company. It gives the reference to the subcontractors or to contractors and the subcontractors such a narrow meaning. And except for this concept of the axe-wielding specialist, those provisions mean nothing under that. That's what gives me pause about your interpretation. My question wasn't clear. If you say that the employees, only the employee of the publicly held company and not the employee of the private -- privately held subcontractor, then that -- the only situation is covered with respect to the contractor is this so-called axe-wielding specialist.

2013,Lozano v. Montoya Alvarez,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Excuse me. Let me give you this example. Suppose a child is abducted at -- at age one and is concealed for 10 years and then the location of the child is discovered. The other parent files a petition. So that if there's equitable tolling, the petition was filed within one year. But during those 10 years, the child has become very well settled in the new country, has learned the language of that country, the customs developed, gone to school, developed relationships, and so forth. Under -- if there is no equitable tolling but the abduction can be taken into account under the doctrine of equitable discretion, that's -- that's one thing. But the way you read this, the way you read the Convention, the equitable tolling would mean that the petition was filed within a year, and unless one of the conditions in Article 13 was met, for example a grave risk that the child's return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation, then there would be -- then the child would have to be removed. So there is that major difference, isn't there, between those two positions? Well, that's true. The position of the Respondent and the government would give a great incentive for parents to abduct children and hide them for a period of time. But on the other side, as my example I think illustrates, your rule would mean that a child who is very well settled in a particular location would have to be returned to the other country for purposes of the custody determination. So why do you think the Convention should be read one way rather than the other? Well, how would it not? But what -- what troubles me about your position is that it undermines the best interests of children in a very powerful way insofar as it does not deter, and indeed encourages, provides a great incentive for parents to abduct their children. And that was the central purpose of the Convention, to prevent harm to children and also to parents, but centrally to children who are abducted. And if you have a rule that says if can abduct the child and you can hide for a year, which isn't very difficult, then all you have to do is provide some evidence of settlement, and you are going to -- you are going to win, you are going to deter return. Am I wrong to be concerned about that? Well, all right. Perhaps that's the solution to the problem then. I wonder if you would accept that, that there is no equitable tolling, let's assume for the sake of argument, but abduction is a strong factor that weighs against the return, that weighs against the failure to return the child, not just something that can be disposed of in a sentence, which is basically what the district court did here, but a very strong factor that has to be taken into account in the exercise of equitable discretion. Would you disagree with that? Well, you -- you're confusing me. Let's say I'm the judge who has to decide this. The one-year period has just past and I have evidence that this child who is now two years old has some friends, goes to play with the friends, goes to the park, has become accustomed to some American customs, knows the neighborhood. So the child is settled to that degree. And you say even if there's been very elaborate -- a very elaborate effort of concealment, no proffered justification for the abduction, no indication that there would be any serious harm if the child were sent back to the U.K., you say that's just too bad. That's your answer? I don't know what sense -- I don't know what sense that makes. Let's say a child is abducted in Mexico and let's say that the parent who is left behind is not a rich or sophisticated person, and now the child is brought to the United States. And the parent in Mexico has a year to find the child in the United States. Doesn't speak English. Can't easily find a lawyer to handle the case. He's got an enormous country to try to find the child in the United States. How in the world is that going to be done? You don't need to do very much concealment. You can go to Peoria. You can go to New York City, and -- and it's going to be an enormous struggle to find that child within a year. ",excuse me let me give you this example suppose a child be abduct at at age one and be conceal for year and then the location of the child be discover the other parent file a petition so that if there be equitable tolling the petition be file within one year but during those year the child have become very well settle in the new country have learn the language of that country the custom develop go to school develop relationship and so forth under if there be no equitable tolling but the abduction can be take into account under the doctrine of equitable discretion that be that be one thing but the way you read this the way you read the convention the equitable tolling would mean that the petition be file within a year and unless one of the condition in article be meet for example a grave risk that the child s return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation then there would be then the child would have to be remove so there be that major difference be not there between those two position well that be true the position of the respondent and the government would give a great incentive for parent to abduct child and hide them for a period of time but on the other side as my example i think illustrates your rule would mean that a child who be very well settle in a particular location would have to be return to the other country for purpose of the custody determination so why do you think the convention should be read one way rather than the other well how would it not but what what trouble me about your position be that it undermine the best interest of child in a very powerful way insofar as it do not deter and indeed encourages provide a great incentive for parent to abduct their child and that be the central purpose of the convention to prevent harm to child and also to parent but centrally to child who be abduct and if you have a rule that say if can abduct the child and you can hide for a year which be not very difficult then all you have to do be provide some evidence of settlement and you be go to you be go to win you be go to deter return be i wrong to be concern about that well all right perhaps that be the solution to the problem then i wonder if you would accept that that there be no equitable tolling let us assume for the sake of argument but abduction be a strong factor that weigh against the return that weigh against the failure to return the child not just something that can be dispose of in a sentence which be basically what the district court do here but a very strong factor that have to be take into account in the exercise of equitable discretion would you disagree with that well you you be confuse me let us say I be the judge who have to decide this the one year period have just past and i have evidence that this child who be now two year old have some friend go to play with the friend go to the park have become accustom to some american custom know the neighborhood so the child be settle to that degree and you say even if there be be very elaborate a very elaborate effort of concealment no proffered justification for the abduction no indication that there would be any serious harm if the child we be send back to the youk you say that be just too bad that be your answer i do not know what sense i do not know what sense that make let us say a child be abduct in mexico and let us say that the parent who be leave behind be not a rich or sophisticated person and now the child be bring to the united state and the parent in mexico have a year to find the child in the united state do not speak english can not easily find a lawyer to handle the case he be get an enormous country to try to find the child in the united state how in the world be that go to be do you do not need to do very much concealment you can go to peoria you can go to new york city and and it be go to be an enormous struggle to find that child within a year ,272.13000000000005,Roberts Court,"Dec 11, 2013",Manuel Jose Lozano,Diana Lucia Montoya Alvarez,12-820,"Jun 24, 2013","Mar 5, 2014",112,0.0,1.0,1.0,0
2013,Paroline v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, before -- before you do that, could you explain why there is an issue of proximate causation here? Why -- why isn't there clearly proximate cause? Why is it -- why does it matter? Yes. But why -- why isn't the issue here a question of factual causation? What losses proximately caused -- is proximately caused by the possession of child pornography? But your answer is in a large category of cases, and this may be -- these may be the typical cases, where there's a digital image and it's out there and you don't even know that there are a thousand people who've seen it. It's impossible to tell how many people have seen it and certainly impossible to see how many people will see it in the future. It -- it exists and it apparently is impossible to eradicate it. Your answer is that in those cases, the victim gets nothing. I mean, that's your honest answer. And that may be where the statute points, but I think that's your answer to Justice Breyer's question: The victim gets nothing in those cases because it's impossible to determine what percentage of the harm is attributable to this one defendant's possession of the child pornography. Well, is it consistent with human psychology? Are psychologists really able to do this? If it's known that this image has been viewed by -- even if you could figure out how many people have viewed it, and I think in the age of the Internet that's impossible, but if you knew that it had been viewed by a thousand people, is a psychologist able to say that her knowledge that it has been viewed by a thousand people causes this much harm? And once she learns that it's now been viewed by a thousand and one people, there's a little bit of additional harm or some increment of additional harm and we can figure out how much that is. Can a psychologist do that? Well, let me give you this-- --I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you. Well, let me give you -- Mr. Cassell, let me give you this example. There are pictures like this and it's known that they are out on the Internet, so therefore they are probably always going to be available and who knows how many people are going to view it. And so the first person is caught for possession of some of these pictures and is convicted and the psychologist testifies that, you know, my client -- that the victim in this case knows that these things are out there and there's an unknown -- an unknown quantity of people are going to view it and my estimate is that the -- the treatment she is going to need for this is going to be $5 million. All right. Or $3 million, whatever it is. Now, the first person is convicted, so the first person is assessed restitution in the amount of $3 million, right? But then shortly after that ten more people are convicted for possessing the same amount. They all pay nothing because the first person paid everything? That's your answer? In my example, suppose that the first person, who has a restitution order for the full amount, seems unlikely ever to be able to pay that. Does that mean that they -- you would impose the same -- keep imposing the same judgment on everybody else, so everybody would be hit with $3 million? ",well before before you do that could you explain why there be an issue of proximate causation here why why be not there clearly proximate because why be it why do it matter yes but why why be not the issue here a question of factual causation what loss proximately cause be proximately cause by the possession of child pornography but your answer be in a large category of case and this may be these may be the typical case where there be a digital image and it be out there and you do not even know that there be a thousand people who have see it it be impossible to tell how many people have see it and certainly impossible to see how many people will see it in the future it it exist and it apparently be impossible to eradicate it your answer be that in those case the victim get nothing i mean that be your honest answer and that may be where the statute point but i think that be your answer to justice breyer s question the victim get nothing in those case because it be impossible to determine what percentage of the harm be attributable to this one defendant s possession of the child pornography well be it consistent with human psychology be psychologist really able to do this if it be know that this image have be view by even if you could figure out how many people have view it and i think in the age of the internet that be impossible but if you know that it have be view by a thousand people be a psychologist able to say that her knowledge that it have be view by a thousand people cause this much harm and once she learn that it be now be view by a thousand and one people there be a little bit of additional harm or some increment of additional harm and we can figure out how much that be can a psychologist do that well let me give you this I be sorry i do not mean to interrupt you well let me give you mr cassell let me give you this example there be picture like this and it be know that they be out on the internet so therefore they be probably always go to be available and who know how many people be go to view it and so the first person be catch for possession of some of these picture and be convict and the psychologist testify that you know my client that the victim in this case know that these thing be out there and there be an unknown an unknown quantity of people be go to view it and my estimate be that the the treatment she be go to need for this be go to be million all right or million whatever it be now the first person be convict so the first person be assess restitution in the amount of million right but then shortly after that ten more people be convict for possess the same amount they all pay nothing because the first person pay everything that be your answer in my example suppose that the first person who have a restitution order for the full amount seem unlikely ever to be able to pay that do that mean that they you would impose the same keep impose the same judgment on everybody else so everybody would be hit with million ,185.64,Roberts Court,"Jan 22, 2014",Doyle Randall Paroline,United States and Amy Unknown,12-8561,"Jun 27, 2013","Apr 23, 2014",112,1.0,1.0,0.0,1
2013,Air Wisconsin Airlines Corp. v. Hoeper,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, Mr. Cohn, on the-- --Well, on the report that was made here, suppose that the report said that the Respondent -- we believe the Respondent is mentally ill, or we believe the Respondent has serious mental problems. Would you -- would you make the same argument if that's what was said? You would? Well, the facts as I understand it were that he became very angry during a test, during a flight simulation test. He took off his headset, pushed back his chair, threw the headset, started cursing at the instructor, and then later, he was -- he was showing anger and cursing for a period of time in other parts of the facility. Does it go beyond that? Is that fair? All right. And you think based on that, you could say, we believe this man is mentally ill? And, Mr. Feigin-- --My understanding of what the Colorado Supreme Court did is this: On the issue of ATSA immunity, it said very clearly that is for the court. And it says in Footnote 5 it gives no weight to the jury's findings of fact with respect to the facts that it found on the immunity question. And then at the end of Footnote 6 what it said was, having found that there is no immunity, then it was proper for the trial judge to submit the defamation issue to the jury and the jury made findings on the defamation issue. Is that -- is that your understanding as well? And are they right that in determining ATSA immunity the jury has no role, doesn't make findings of historical fact, who said what, anything like that? Well, before you get to that, before you get to that, to finish up on the point you were making earlier, suppose that the report is he ranted for 10 minutes, and then suppose the jury found he ranted for 7 minutes. Now, maybe those 3 minutes would make a difference, make a difference in the impression on the TSA. That would be enough in your view? Well, on two of the -- on two of the three statements, the difference between the literal -- the very strict truth and what was said is very slight. You dispute that. They'd said he's an FFO officer and he may be armed. That's literally true. It's literally true. He's an FFO officer. He has a gun. He may be armed. What would be a true statement? Not with respect to the lawyer; with respect to your client. But you're talking about a very subtle implication of the statement. And I agree with you, there's an implication there that may not be justified, but you're talking about something very subtle in -- in the context of -- of someone making a call to report a possible threat. Well, do you think it makes a difference we're talking here about a pilot? I mean, my impression of pilots is that they are supposed to remain perfectly calm even when terrible things happen. Well, all the -- you know, all engines are on fire and one of the wings has fallen off, but, you know, you don't start ranting and screaming. And so someone described him as acting in a manner that was more unprofessional than they had ever seen. Do you think that makes a difference? But maybe for ordinary people, but how about for pilots.

2013,"Northwest, Inc. v. Ginsberg",112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Is it the case that-- Let me change the hypothetical slightly. Suppose the contract says that one of the parties reserves sole discretion to do something and then the contract goes on to say: And then in exercising this discretion, we don't promise to act in a reasonable manner. But the State court says that, nevertheless, that has to be interpreted to mean that the party can only perform in a reasonable manner. Then what would the situation be? Well, let me ask you this. Suppose you have in Minnesota or one of the States where you say the covenant is simply a way of effectuating the intent of the parties, you have a contract between two very tough and nasty businessmen. And they write right in their contract, you know, we're going to comply with the literal terms of this contract, but we do not promise each other that we're going to proceed in good faith or that we are going to deal with each other fairly. We are going to take every advantage we can under the literal terms of the contract. Now, would that get rid of the covenant under Minnesota law? Well, how do you account for the fact that in many States the covenant of good faith and fair dealing is read into most contracts, but is not read into employment contracts? Well, doesn't that discrepancy show simply that the State has different policies with respect to those two types of contracts? An at-will employment contract is a contract that gives the employer sole discretion as to whether to retain an employee. And here we have a contract that says that the airline has sole discretion to determine whether to terminate somebody from the frequent flyer program. So what is the difference? May I ask you a question about something slightly different? An amicus brief submitted in support of your position by California and some other States points out at some length that there are now a lot of frequent flyer programs in which a lot of miles are earned by making purchases other than for -- for flights and in which miles can also be spent for things other than flights. Do we have to worry about that in this case? What are the facts relating to this particular plan? Can you earn miles by doing things other than flying? Can you spend miles on things other than flying? I don't want to take up your rebuttal time, but if the facts were that under a particular program 90 percent of the miles were earned by purchasing things other than flying and 90 percent of the miles were spent on things other than flying, wouldn't that be very different?

2013,Octane Fitness v. ICON Health & Fitness,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","You have several objections, I take it, to what the Federal Circuit has said. One is that you think objectively baseless is too low, correct? You also don't think bad faith is necessary? And do you also believe that litigation misconduct taken in conjunction with a case that is, let's say, of little merit, but perhaps not as low as the standard that you have, that you're suggesting, would justify an award of fees? Let's say that I'm a district judge someplace and I rarely get a patent case. How am I supposed to determine whether the case is exceptional if the standard is, take everything into account, litigation misconduct, the strength of the case, any indication of bad faith, and decide whether it's exceptional? Exceptional compared to what? I have very little basis for comparison. How do I do that? Compared to what? Compared to the types of cases that the District Court hears on a more regular basis? Or patent cases? See, this is what I find somewhat troubling about your ""take everything into account"" standard. Most district court judges do not see a lot of patent cases, and when they see one it's very unusual. So you've got these patent attorneys showing up in court. They are different from other attorneys. [Laughter] Sometimes they -- particularly if it's a very technical case, they speak a different language. They do things differently. The district judge is struggling to figure out how to handle the case. And then the -- one -- one party wins, the other party loses and the party that wins says, this was an exceptional case and you should award fees in my favor under 285. And the district judge says: How can I tell if this is exceptional? If I had 25 patent cases, I could make some comparisons. But I don't have a basis for doing that. Now, the Federal Circuit has a basis for doing it. Is that really true? There's nearly 700 district judges in the country. If we had a statistic about the average number of patent cases that a district judge hears and receives on, let's say, a 5-year period, what would it be? What is the difference between -- you say the correct phrase is ""objectively unreasonable""? That's different from objectively baseless. That's a little higher than objectively baseless. And that's higher than the Rule 11 standard?

2013,Kaley v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, that's -- I'm sorry. That's pretrial detention without bail. I thought Justice Scalia's question had to do with detaining someone who was indicted but couldn't make bail. But why in that situation would the defendant not have the constitutional right to have a determination by a judge as to whether there was probable cause? At these hearings when they have been conducted, what do they look like? The rules of evidence would not apply, I assume, so the government could call, let's say, a case agent who would provide a summary of some of the evidence, enough of the evidence that was submitted to the grand jury to establish probable cause in the opinion of the prosecution, and then what would happen? You could call witnesses. Could you subpoena witnesses? Could you require the disclosure of the names of government witnesses? Well, this was an unusual -- that's a somewhat unusual situation where you had been -- there had already been a trial of someone else who was allegedly involved in the scheme. But what if that was not the case? In the more ordinary situation, what would happen? There's been a suggestion that if the judge were to find that there was a lack of probable cause, the prosecutor would be under an ethical obligation to dismiss the charges. Do you agree with that? And what if it's the same evidence, the same evidence is introduced before the grand jury. Let's say it's a credibility determination. The grand jury finds the prosecution witness credible, the judge finds the prosecution witness not credible. Is there, then, an ethical obligation to dismiss the charges? I think that -- I'm sorry. But that's what it seems to me this case is all about. All the talk about whether -- about defendants being exonerated, that the judge is going to find a lack of probable cause, that's, you know, that's fantasy land for the most part. But what it's really about is about discovery. Prosecutors hate preliminary examinations. When do they ever occur in Federal felony cases? They are always, almost always eliminated by indictment. The defense bar hates grand jury proceedings. They would like to have a preliminary hearing where they get some discovery of the government's trial case, and that's what this is all about. So it seems to me that what's important is the nature. If there is going to be any kind of a hearing, what is going to take place at this hearing? And what typically happens beyond what I mentioned before, a case agent taking the stand and providing some summary of the, of the evidence that was provided to the grand jury? How much further do they go? Is the defense entitled to any discovery? Do they subpoena witnesses? What do you mean this is the kind of hearing that's held every day? I thought these -- in some circuits, it is. But it's held occasionally. ",well that be I be sorry that be pretrial detention without bail i think justice scalia s question have to do with detain someone who be indict but could not make bail but why in that situation would the defendant not have the constitutional right to have a determination by a judge as to whether there be probable because at these hearing when they have be conduct what do they look like the rule of evidence would not apply i assume so the government could call let us say a case agent who would provide a summary of some of the evidence enough of the evidence that be submit to the grand jury to establish probable because in the opinion of the prosecution and then what would happen you could call witness could you subpoena witness could you require the disclosure of the name of government witness well this be an unusual that be a somewhat unusual situation where you have be there have already be a trial of someone else who be allegedly involve in the scheme but what if that be not the case in the more ordinary situation what would happen there be be a suggestion that if the judge we be to find that there be a lack of probable because the prosecutor would be under an ethical obligation to dismiss the charge do you agree with that and what if it be the same evidence the same evidence be introduce before the grand jury let us say it be a credibility determination the grand jury find the prosecution witness credible the judge find the prosecution witness not credible be there then an ethical obligation to dismiss the charge i think that I be sorry but that be what it seem to me this case be all about all the talk about whether about defendant be exonerate that the judge be go to find a lack of probable because that be you know that be fantasy land for the most part but what it be really about be about discovery prosecutor hate preliminary examination when do they ever occur in federal felony case they be always almost always eliminate by indictment the defense bar hate grand jury proceeding they would like to have a preliminary hearing where they get some discovery of the government s trial case and that be what this be all about so it seem to me that what be important be the nature if there be go to be any kind of a hearing what be go to take place at this hearing and what typically happen beyond what i mention before a case agent take the stand and provide some summary of the of the evidence that be provide to the grand jury how much far do they go be the defense entitle to any discovery do they subpoena witness what do you mean this be the kind of hearing that be hold every day i think these in some circuit it be but it be hold occasionally ,160.37,Roberts Court,"Oct 16, 2013",Kerri L.

The court could say it wasn't reasonably -- it wasn't clearly established, but it was an unreasonable seizure. It could do that, couldn't it? No, that wasn't my question. The -- the court has to, ruling on qualified immunity, it has to decide whether there -- whether the law was reasonably -- the rule that's being applied was reasonably -- was clearly established. But having done that, even if it says it was and, therefore, the defendant is entitled to qualified immunity, doesn't Pearson say that the court has discretion about whether to go on to the second prong?

And the driver then begins to drive away. What does a -- what do reasonable officers do? Maybe they -- what they should do is to continue the chase indefinitely. I don't know. What do you think? But I thought the reasonableness of a Fourth Amendment seizure was an objective question, not a subjective question. So why does it matter what reason he subjectively had? Well, I know. But if he -- he says I did it because I thought he was going to run me over. But an objective officer looking at the situation would say that the use of deadly force is necessary here to prevent this chase from continuing on the interstate and endangering other motorists and their passengers. So if that were the situation, wouldn't that mean that was a reasonable seizure? Initiated by the fact by the officer who used the force had a different motive? What if the situation is that the officer has -- has this choice. After a high-speed chase, after attempting to persuade the driver to get out of the car, the officer has one -- has these choices: Allow the chase to continue or use lethal force. Your answer is they have to let the -- they -- they can use lethal force? They have to allow the chase to continue? What? Which? As to the number of shots, even with all the shots that were fired, Mr. Rickard still was able to drive away for a short distance. Isn't that right? So what does that do to the argument that too many shots were fired? ",be not it the case that the court have discretion to reach the second prong if it want to the court could say it be not reasonably it be not clearly establish but it be an unreasonable seizure it could do that could not it no that be not my question the the court have to rule on qualified immunity it have to decide whether there whether the law be reasonably the rule that be be apply be reasonably be clearly establish but have do that even if it say it be and therefore the defendant be entitle to qualify immunity do not pearson say that the court have discretion about whether to go on to the second prong well what do you think the officer should have do at that point what should a reasonable officer do when there have be a high speed chase and the car spin out of control and forget about whether there be any attempt to ram anybody or to hit to anybody with the car the car spin out of control it be eventually surround by officer with gun point at the driver demanding that he get out that he put up his hand stop driving they be pound on the on the window of the car and the driver then begin to drive away what do a what do reasonable officer do maybe they what they should do be to continue the chase indefinitely i do not know what do you think but i think the reasonableness of a fourth amendment seizure be an objective question not a subjective question so why do it matter what reason he subjectively have well i know but if he he say i do it because i think he be go to run me over but an objective officer look at the situation would say that the use of deadly force be necessary here to prevent this chase from continue on the interstate and endanger other motorist and their passenger so if that we be the situation would not that mean that be a reasonable seizure initiate by the fact by the officer who use the force have a different motive what if the situation be that the officer have have this choice after a high speed chase after attempt to persuade the driver to get out of the car the officer have one have these choice allow the chase to continue or use lethal force your answer be they have to let the they they can use lethal force they have to allow the chase to continue what which as to the number of shot even with all the shot that we be fire mr rickard still be able to drive away for a short distance be not that right so what do that do to the argument that too many shot we be fire ,160.89000000000004,Roberts Court,"Mar 4, 2014",Vance Plumhoff,Whitne Rickard,12-1117,"Nov 15, 2013","May 27, 2014",112,1.0,1.0,0.0,1
2013,Robers v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Mr. Green, here's one way of looking at this case. Maybe you'll tell me this is the wrong way of looking at it. But let's assume that the bank sells the -- the property within a reasonable period of time or as quickly as one could reasonably expect. So one way of looking at this is which party bears the risk that there is going to be a significant deterioration in the real estate market between the time of foreclosure and the time of sale? Now, your answer to that is that the -- that the victim should bear that risk? Why should that be? Why would Congress want that? But real estate isn't completely liquid and so it takes some time to sell it. So between the time when the foreclosure occurs and the time when the victim is able to sell the property and get money, there -- there is a deterioration in the real estate market. Why should the victim bear that risk? That's a completely formalistic answer. Suppose that the -- what the -- what the person who perpetrated the fraud returns is a truckload of tomatoes. Very valuable. It's worth exactly the value of the -- of the original loan. But very perishable. And by the time the -- the tomatoes can be sold they're all rotten. So they're worth nothing. And you would say, well, they had dominion and control over the truckload of tomatoes. What is the difference? Well, Ms. Harrington, is it correct this argument that it's all under A? It has been said that the -- getting to B is based on this idea. A says if you can't return the property -- if you can't return the money, B says return the money. But is that accurate? What A says is if you don't -- if it's impossible to return the money, assuming that's the thing at issue, B says return the value. And under 3664, it is possible for the court to order not A, not restitution of money, but restitution of in-kind services. So there can be -- value can be conveyed in a form other than money, so it isn't circular, is it, in the way that's been suggested? Is there any reason why the -- why the sentencing judge, where there's an -- an allegation and maybe a -- a suggestion that there was unreasonable delay or something unreasonable was going on require the government to provide some substantiation for -- for what happened? ",mr green here s one way of look at this case maybe you will tell me this be the wrong way of look at it but let us assume that the bank sell the the property within a reasonable period of time or as quickly as one could reasonably expect so one way of look at this be which party bear the risk that there be go to be a significant deterioration in the real estate market between the time of foreclosure and the time of sale now your answer to that be that the that the victim should bear that risk why should that be why would congress want that but real estate be not completely liquid and so it take some time to sell it so between the time when the foreclosure occur and the time when the victim be able to sell the property and get money there there be a deterioration in the real estate market why should the victim bear that risk that be a completely formalistic answer suppose that the what the what the person who perpetrate the fraud return be a truckload of tomato very valuable it be worth exactly the value of the of the original loan but very perishable and by the time the the tomato can be sell they be all rotten so they be worth nothing and you would say well they have dominion and control over the truckload of tomato what be the difference well ms harrington be it correct this argument that it be all under a it have be say that the get to b be base on this idea a say if you can not return the property if you can not return the money b say return the money but be that accurate what a say be if you do not if it be impossible to return the money assume that be the thing at issue b say return the value and under it be possible for the court to order not a not restitution of money but restitution of in kind service so there can be value can be convey in a form other than money so it be not circular be it in the way that be be suggest be there any reason why the why the sentencing judge where there be an an allegation and maybe a a suggestion that there be unreasonable delay or something unreasonable be go on require the government to provide some substantiation for for what happen ,146.36,Roberts Court,"Feb 25, 2014",Benjamin Robers,United States,12-9012,"Oct 21, 2013","May 5, 2014",112,0.0,1.0,0.0,0
2013,Madigan v. Levin,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Now, we have an amicus brief from law professors who argue that the Seventh Circuit should not have considered the question of whether there was a cause of action under Section 1983. But they also go on to argue that we, nevertheless, have jurisdiction to consider that question, and that it is a -- a matter of discretion for us to decide whether to do that. Is that -- do you agree with that position? If the existence of a cause of action could not be considered in an interlocutory qualified immunity appeal, what would the effect be on the defendant's right not to be tried, which is the whole reason for allowing an interlocutory appeal in qualified immunity cases? Wouldn't it be the case that if the district court found that there was no qualified immunity, then the case would have to be tried. And only at the end of the case could it be determined whether there actually was a cause of action. So you have a trial potentially about nothing. Has the Court ever held that an antidiscrimination statute that does not provide any rights for a particular class of plaintiffs nevertheless extinguishes the right of action that those plaintiffs would have under Section 1983? What if Mr. Levin were under 40 years old? Would you say that his equal protection Section 1983 cause of action was extinguished by the ADEA? So what is the difference between someone who's under 40 and someone who is not an employee within the meaning of the ADEA? Well, why should we consider that question? If this -- if we were back in the era before the enactment of the GERA, yes, we would have to consider that question. But now that the new statute has been passed, why should we consider whether someone who was a non-employee lacked a -- a 1983 cause of action during the period when that -- prior to the enactment of that statute? In your brief, could I just -- you say -- I think this is pretty close to the exact words: There's no realistic possibility of your obtaining a holding that Mr. Levin is an employee within the ADEA. But do you concede that now? No. Do you concede that he is not an employee? If you just say that there's no realistic possibility that the courts are going to take this correct position, then the issue is still in the case. So is it your position that he is an employee or he is not an employee? Well, if you're not willing to say that he is not an employee, then the issue is still in the case, and we would have -- if we were to rule on the ADEA issue, wouldn't we have to decide whether there is a remedy for somebody who is an employee within the ADEA? The district court might be wrong on that. The Seventh Circuit might be wrong on that. And you may be right. There's not much of a realistic possibility that you're going to get a reversal of that. But the issue is still in the case unless you want to give it up. So what-- --You want us to hold that the Seventh Circuit lacked jurisdiction to consider whether there is a cause of action under Section 1983. So that precedent, that Seventh Circuit precedent, would be wedged from the books. The issue would be back in the case. If ultimately there was another appeal, maybe it would go to a different Seventh Circuit panel. Maybe it would come out differently. So you want that wiped away. And you want us to hold only -- to limit our consideration to the ADEA and not consider GERA, so that would be back in the case when it came -- when it went back to the district court. So that's correct? That's what you want? Can I ask you a question about the constitutional right? Do you agree that the standard for an equal protection age-discrimination claim is traditional, full-blown, rational-basis review? So that if there's any conceivable ground on which the decisionmaker could have decided that age was -- it was proper to make an age classification, there is no constitutional violation? No, I'm just talking about equal protection age discrimination. And what if the Illinois legislature passed a statute that said: Now, forget about the ADEA. There is no ADEA. There is no state anti-discrimination law involved here. All we are talking about is equal protection. And they passed a law that said: All attorneys working for the State of Illinois must retire at the age of 60, because everybody knows, you know, once a lawyer passes 60, there's nothing left. Would that be -- would that survive a rational basis review? Well, that's true, but is that the issue? Is that really the qualified immunity issue, whether irrational age discrimination violates equal protection? Or is the qualified immunity issue whether, on the facts here, an official could believe that there was no constitutional violation, reasonably believe there was no constitutional violation? Isn't the latter-- --Isn't the latter the real question. Well, that's not what the district court held though, is it? I thought the district court simply held that an official should have realized that irrational age discrimination was a violation of the Constitution, not that an official should have realized that it was a violation of the Constitution to do what was alleged to have been done here. You don't see the difference between the two? If there's a qualified immunity appeal on the question -- on the issue of whether, let's say, a search was an unreasonable search, would qualified immunity be denied on the ground that an official should realize that an unreasonable search is unconstitutional? Would that be -- would that be the issue under qualified immunity? Ah, on the facts that were presented. ",now we have an amicus brief from law professor who argue that the seventh circuit should not have consider the question of whether there be a because of action under section but they also go on to argue that we nevertheless have jurisdiction to consider that question and that it be a a matter of discretion for us to decide whether to do that be that do you agree with that position if the existence of a because of action could not be consider in an interlocutory qualified immunity appeal what would the effect be on the defendant s right not to be try which be the whole reason for allow an interlocutory appeal in qualified immunity case would not it be the case that if the district court find that there be no qualified immunity then the case would have to be try and only at the end of the case could it be determine whether there actually be a because of action so you have a trial potentially about nothing have the court ever hold that an antidiscrimination statute that do not provide any right for a particular class of plaintiff nevertheless extinguish the right of action that those plaintiff would have under section what if mr levin we be under year old would you say that his equal protection section because of action be extinguish by the adea so what be the difference between someone who be under and someone who be not an employee within the meaning of the adea well why should we consider that question if this if we we be back in the era before the enactment of the gera yes we would have to consider that question but now that the new statute have be pass why should we consider whether someone who be a non employee lack a a because of action during the period when that prior to the enactment of that statute in your brief could i just you say i think this be pretty close to the exact word there be no realistic possibility of your obtain a hold that mr levin be an employee within the adea but do you concede that now no do you concede that he be not an employee if you just say that there be no realistic possibility that the court be go to take this correct position then the issue be still in the case so be it your position that he be an employee or he be not an employee well if you be not willing to say that he be not an employee then the issue be still in the case and we would have if we we be to rule on the adea issue would not we have to decide whether there be a remedy for somebody who be an employee within the adea the district court might be wrong on that the seventh circuit might be wrong on that and you may be right there be not much of a realistic possibility that you be go to get a reversal of that but the issue be still in the case unless you want to give it up so what you want us to hold that the seventh circuit lack jurisdiction to consider whether there be a because of action under section so that precedent that seventh circuit precedent would be wedge from the book the issue would be back in the case if ultimately there be another appeal maybe it would go to a different seventh circuit panel maybe it would come out differently so you want that wipe away and you want us to hold only to limit our consideration to the adea and not consider gera so that would be back in the case when it come when it go back to the district court so that be correct that be what you want can i ask you a question about the constitutional right do you agree that the standard for an equal protection age discrimination claim be traditional full blown rational basis review so that if there be any conceivable ground on which the decisionmaker could have decide that age be it be proper to make an age classification there be no constitutional violation no I be just talk about equal protection age discrimination and what if the illinois legislature pass a statute that say now forget about the adea there be no adea there be no state anti discrimination law involve here all we be talk about be equal protection and they pass a law that say all attorney work for the state of illinois must retire at the age of because everybody know you know once a lawyer pass there be nothing left would that be would that survive a rational basis review well that be true but be that the issue be that really the qualified immunity issue whether irrational age discrimination violate equal protection or be the qualified immunity issue whether on the fact here an official could believe that there be no constitutional violation reasonably believe there be no constitutional violation be not the latter be not the latter the real question well that be not what the district court hold though be it i think the district court simply hold that an official should have realize that irrational age discrimination be a violation of the constitution not that an official should have realize that it be a violation of the constitution to do what be allege to have be do here you do not see the difference between the two if there be a qualified immunity appeal on the question on the issue of whether let us say a search be an unreasonable search would qualify immunity be deny on the ground

Alito, Jr.","If we forget what happened at earlier stages of this litigation, and I think that the parties' positions have clarified, when you put it that way, as this has progressed, what -- on what point of law do you and Mr. Hacker now disagree? I'm not sure you disagree. You certainly do not disagree about what the answer to the question presented is. You both say no. It is not categorically barred. So on what point of law do you disagree? Now, but forget -- Well, I will ask Mr. Hacker. But I -- you understand him to take the position that unless there are some changed circumstances, a trustee can simply make no inquiry about the continued prudence of assets purchased in the past. You just sit on them. You don't even think about whether this is still a good investment or not. That -- that -- you think that's his position. On what point -- on what point of law do you and Mr. Frederick now disagree? I mean -- I mean, at a higher level of -- level of abstraction than that. Not as applied, not the particular things that need to be done. He says in his reply brief, ""No precise rule dictates how often a fiduciary must review the portfolio or how detailed periodic reviews must be. Rather, as with trust administration, generally, the duty to monitor is subject to the reasonable person's standard; that is, the fiduciary must engage in the kind of review that a reasonable, prudent fiduciary would conduct under the circumstances."" Do you disagree with any of that? With respect to all or some of these funds, did the plan qualify for the institutional shares or did it have to get a waiver from the administrator? Just so I understand this, you're saying that as to some funds, it was necessary to get a waiver. As to others, the record doesn't show whether it was necessary to get a waiver or not? This is a very big pension plan and it seems odd that it would not have enough funds to qualify for institutional shares. These institutional shares must be restricted to -- I don't know what, the most gigantic investor in the world. That seems like a potentially important point, but maybe it's not. I mean, if the investment advisor can simply look at the criteria for getting institutional shares and see that the fund would qualify and the costs for those would be less, then that seems like a more obvious switch to make than if you look at the criteria and you see that you don't qualify and you would have to inquire about whether you could get a waiver. Maybe in the industry, it's well known that you can obtain a waiver, but it seems like a somewhat different inquiry.

Has there been any suggestion at any point in this case -- in the district court, in the court of appeals, in the papers that have been filed here -- that the decision was based on anything other than the reasoning of the district court? Any other reason been given? Let me give you an example of something that happens quite frequently and maybe you can tell me if this situation is any different from that. A district court has to make a decision on something as to which the district court has discretion. A party urges the district court to make a particular decision based on one ground. And the one ground is based on a legal error. The district court rules in favor of that party but says absolutely nothing. Now the issue is raised on appeal, the argument is that the trial judge abused his or her discretion. Now, would that be insulate it from review for abuse of discretion on the ground that, well, we really don't know why the judge did what the judge did? The judge didn't say anything. So the judge might not have based the decision on this one -- on this legal error, the only ground that was urged upon the court. It might have been based on something else. What would be -- is that different from this situation? That might be a little premature. Maybe you answered this before, but is it your position that under the Class Action Fairness Act the court of appeals has absolute discretion, unlimited discretion, to decide whether to take an appeal or not? Any reason whatsoever is okay? So what if the court of appeals says, we are not taking this because we just don't like the Class Action Fairness Act. We think it's bad public policy; we are never going to take one of these. That's okay? I was going say -- and this is not certainly true of the Tenth Circuit -- but suppose things change and we get to the point where each judge on the Tenth Circuit is sitting on ten cases a year, and so they can have a ten-month vacation. And they say, well, we don't want to take this, because, you know, we may not have a ten-month vacation, we'll have a nine-month vacation. Would that be all right? Well, all the Class Action Fairness Act says is, I believe, is that the court may take the case. It doesn't -- it doesn't specify the scope of discretion. It doesn't say it's absolute. Outside of the Class Action Fairness Act, may a district court -- is a court of appeals barred from reviewing a decision of the district court to remand the case based on docket control?

2014,Holt v. Hobbs,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Where are you -- how do you-- --How do you reconcile deference with the strict scrutiny that the statute requires? Well, there are -- there are two questions there. One is, which you've -- is a good question. Where does this idea of deference come from in this context? But the question I was asking was: How do you think, assuming that there is a role for deference, how does it fit together with what the statute expressly requires? Do you have that same concern with the prisoners who have a very short beard for medical reasons? How long is -- how long are the whiskers when that is done? You're saying that they're completely clean-shaven? Clean-shaven is somebody like you, all right? And that's how they -- and that would satisfy the medical problem? To be shaved that closely? Why is that? Why is that so? Are you saying that somebody with or without a half inch beard -- that's a bigger difference than somebody who has longish hair versus the same person with a shaved head? When a prisoner goes out in the field and then wants to come back to the barracks, are the prisoners wearing an ID; is that correct. And does it say which barracks that prisoner is supposed to go to? Does the ID have a picture on it? I'm just trying -- I'm having difficulty envisioning what you're -- the scenario that you're -- you're suggesting. So a prisoner who's supposed to be in barracks A has a 1/2-inch beard, has an ID that says barracks A, has that person's picture on it, goes out in the field, brings a razor with him? While he's out there, he shaves, then he wants to come back and go into barracks B. And how's he going to get into barracks B if he has an ID that says barracks A? Now you say he's going to trade with another prisoner? Then he will have a different picture on the ID, he's going to alter -- they're going to alter the IDs also while they're out there in the fields? So he has to find somebody who also looks like him from barracks B. As far as concealment is concerned, what -- what is the difference between a 1/2-inch beard and hair on the head that's much longer?

And I don't know that there's even one of those. This is a question I probably should have asked petitioner, but what do you understand his -- what do you understand him to mean when he says it has to be final on appeal? Suppose that there is an appeal pending in one of the prior strike cases, but it's perfectly clear that the notice of appeal in that instance was filed woefully out of time. Would that be final on appeal? What about the fact that this provision refers to a prior occasion on which an action was dismissed? If you put ""prior"" and ""action"" together, isn't there the suggestion that we're talking about an action that is different from the action that is before the court of appeals in what is arguably the third strike? In that connection, before your time runs out, can a case be final on -- can a case be final on appeal if there is a -- an appeal pending but the notice of appeal is untimely?

How realistic is it to try to break that down and determine which of the two is the primary purpose? There's -- there's an awful -- a -- a great distance between Justice Kagan's hypothetical and what happened here. First of all, there's the age of the Declarant. Do you really think a three-year-old or a three and a half-year-old can have any conception that the thing that the -- that this child is saying is going to be used in court to prosecute somebody for a crime? All right. So the Declarant is out. And then you have the teacher, and the teacher isn't saying anything about gathering evidence for a criminal prosecution. I would think the first thing on the teacher's -- I -- I don't think the teacher probably broke it down that way. The teacher is concerned about the safety of this child, period. Sure. Let's suppose that everybody who could have possibly done this to the child was immune from criminal prosecution. They're all diplomats. They all have diplomatic immunity. Would the teacher have done anything different? The Confrontation Clause applies in civil cases? No, but all these people, they are immune from prosecution, from criminal prosecution. Would the teacher have done anything different? Well, that would be the end of the question, isn't it? Because then the teacher has no purpose of gathering evidence for use in a criminal prosecution.

2014,Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, you began by -- by criticizing Alabama for supposedly imposing quotas. But listening to your argument, it sounds to me that you are just as interested in quotas. You're just interested in lower quotas. So if you -- if they want to keep it at 70 percent, that's that may be illegitimate in your view. But if they take it down to the minimum that would be required in order to produce the desired result, that's a -- that's a -- a permissible quota. So why are you using this term “ quota ” at all? Well, why did you use it? You think there's a difference between the two? Did the district court understand you to be asserting a district-specific -- district-specific claims? Where -- where do you find that in the -- in the opinion of the district court? I thought the district court interpreted you not to be making that claim. Well, explain -- now that you're talking about districts, could I come back to the question I asked at the beginning, so that I understand what we have to decide. On page 128 of the Joint Appendix, there's a paragraph in the district court opinion that explains what the district court understood to be -- to before it on the issue of intentional discrimination. I see nowhere any indication that the district court construed your pleadings and your other submissions to raise a claim about any specific district. The third point is we construe the filings of the Democratic Conference plaintiffs as arguing that certain senate districts constitute racial gerrymanders. There's nothing like that with respect to your client. Maybe I'm missing something. So if that's how the district court understood your position, then maybe it was wrong, but that would be the threshold question we'd have to decide, wouldn't it be, that if you have to be district-specific, we would have to say the district court misunderstood the claims that you were asserting? The district court understood that? Then why did it include this paragraph and why did it not go through any districts that it saw you as challenging? It went through some that it saw the other plaintiffs as challenging, none with respect to you. General, you say that the district court erred in addressing the claim of racial gerrymandering on a statewide rather than a district-specific basis. I would assume that that was an error on the part of the district court only if a district-specific claim was asserted by the plaintiffs, but you don't address that issue. Well, the Solicitor General just said that if you look at that district, it has a very bizarre shape and the effect of the bizarre shape is to pull in predominantly African-American areas and exclude predominantly white areas. Is he correct on that? Could I follow up on Justice Breyer's exploration of what would happen if this was done over? I assume that Section 5 would not be a consideration so long as a new coverage formula is not adopted by Congress. Is that correct? And the legislature could do whatever it wants if it's -- if it relies purely on partisanship rather than on race. And to what degree would or could -- to what degree would the legislature be justified in doing and to what degree would it be required to take into account the degree, if any, to which Section 2 imposes something like a retrogression requirement? And do we know what that might be? What would happen if you -- if you're -- if on a do-over, the objective was to produce maximum Republican representation in both houses of the legislature. And the way -- in and doing that, there was a drastic reduction in the number of African-American senators and representatives. Would that be a violation of Section 2? ",well you begin by by criticize alabama for supposedly impose quota but listen to your argument it sound to me that you be just as interested in quota you be just interested in low quota so if you if they want to keep it at percent that be that may be illegitimate in your view but if they take it down to the minimum that would be require in order to produce the desired result that be a that be a a permissible quota so why be you use this term quota at all well why do you use it you think there be a difference between the two do the district court understand you to be assert a district specific district specific claim where where do you find that in the in the opinion of the district court i think the district court interpret you not to be make that claim well explain now that you be talk about district could i come back to the question i ask at the beginning so that i understand what we have to decide on page of the joint appendix there be a paragraph in the district court opinion that explain what the district court understand to be to before it on the issue of intentional discrimination i see nowhere any indication that the district court construe your pleading and your other submission to raise a claim about any specific district the third point be we construe the filing of the democratic conference plaintiff as argue that certain senate district constitute racial gerrymander there be nothing like that with respect to your client maybe I be miss something so if that be how the district court understand your position then maybe it be wrong but that would be the threshold question we would have to decide would not it be that if you have to be district specific we would have to say the district court misunderstand the claim that you we be assert the district court understand that then why do it include this paragraph and why do it not go through any district that it saw you as challenge it go through some that it saw the other plaintiff as challenging none with respect to you general you say that the district court err in address the claim of racial gerrymandering on a statewide rather than a district specific basis i would assume that that be an error on the part of the district court only if a district specific claim be assert by the plaintiff but you do not address that issue well the solicitor general just say that if you look at that district it have a very bizarre shape and the effect of the bizarre shape be to pull in predominantly african american area and exclude predominantly white area be he correct on that could i follow up on justice breyer s exploration of what would happen if this be do over i assume that section would not be a consideration so long as a new coverage formula be not adopt by congress be that correct and the legislature could do whatever it want if it be if it rely purely on partisanship rather than on race and to what degree would or could to what degree would the legislature be justify in do and to what degree would it be require to take into account the degree if any to which section imposes something like a retrogression requirement and do we know what that might be what would happen if you if you be if on a do over the objective be to produce maximum republican representation in both house of the legislature and the way in and do that there be a drastic reduction in the number of african american senator and representative would that be a violation of section ,226.26,Roberts Court,"Nov 12, 2014",,,13-895,"Jun 2, 2014","Mar 25, 2015",112,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

Suppose the -- suppose the instrument of denial, the letter, does not list any reasons, but it incorporates by reference or makes reference to some other document that sets out the reasons? Is that sufficient? All right. Well, suppose that-- --Just to follow up, I'm sorry to interrupt. Suppose the letter doesn't make a specific reference to some other document, but there is some other document known to the parties that has been approved by the town council and sets out the reasons, that would not be sufficient. There has to be an express reference in the instrument of denial. What happens if-- --What if -- what if three people say, this is -- this is incompatible with the neighborhood, and then later other -- another member or other members provide other reasons, and those other reasons are either invalid under the statute or not supported by substantial evidence? Under that circumstance, is it -- can it be inferred that the final vote of those who previously expressed the view that this was bad for aesthetic reasons was the reason for their vote? That seems to be Mr. Fisher's argument, and what's your answer to that? That may be what the -- what the statute means in light of the practicalities of the situation. Now, since it talks about substantial evidence review, there's an argument that a municipality, when it makes a decision like this, should be treated pretty much like a Federal administrative agency. But on the other hand, municipalities are sometimes very small. These -- these bodies are -- consist of lay people who are not learned in the law, they may not have attorneys available to them who are very knowledgeable about Federal telecommunications law. So can you say something about that situation? Is any of that true with respect to -- to Roswell? And what do you think Congress may have had in mind in a situation with respect to the treatment of local governing bodies like Federal administrative agencies? Well, suppose we issue an opinion in this case that says that the the formal instrument of denial must say in simple terms the reason or reasons for the denial. All right? Let's say we issue that opinion, and six months later something like this comes up in some rural municipality. Let's say they've got 1,000 people. And how likely is it that the members of the governing body there, or their attorney, if they have an attorney, will be familiar with our decision in T-Mobile South v. City of Roswell?

2014,Kerry v. Din,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Can I come back to -- can I come back to Justice Breyer's earlier hypothetical. Suppose there were a case where there is incontrovertible proof that the consular officer denied the visa for some incredible ground based on racism or belief that husbands and wives shouldn't live together. Suppose there's a -- a tape -- a video recording or audio recording of the consular officer saying this is what I believe, and this is what I do when I pass on these visas. Would there be no administrative avenue of relief if that information was submitted to the State Department? Would there be no opportunity to -- to get a correction of the visa denial in that way? May I ask you how this would play out as a practical matter? I -- Congress apparently believed that requiring the government to specify the particular subsection under which the visa was denied had the potential of providing information that might be damaging to the security of the United States. So let's -- let's say that the -- the government comes in and says that, that in this case they say, we can't -- we don't want to tell you which of these particular subsections this action was taken under because we believe that under the circumstances of this case, revealing that information will tell -- would tell the alien, if the information reached the alien, how much we know about him and possibly how we found that out. So you say -- what? The information would have to be provided to the judge alone? Would the judge provide it to the alien? Would the judge provide it to counsel? How would that work out? That is an issue in all of these cases, but tell me how it would work out. But can the judge say, I'm not going to tell counsel?

There is a difference between those two situations, isn't there? If the test is subjective as you claim, with respect to the issuer, whose subjective state of mind should -- must the Court look at? Would it be solely the person who signs on behalf of the issuer, or would it be everyone else who is required by law to sign the registration statement? The Sixth Circuit held that once a false statement has been made, a defendant's knowledge is not relevant to a strict liability claim. Was that correct? Since that's the holding of the Sixth Circuit, don't we at a minimum have an obligation to vacate and remand? Because they didn't hold that their reasonable basis standard was satisfied here. Well, if it's not purely subjective, if it's the reasonable basis test, what does that mean? Mr. Shanmugam says that's very openended. And I think he has a point. I don't really know what a reasonable basis would be in that situation. But to what degree must the person let's just take the CEO who signs on behalf of the corporation. To what degree must he conduct an investigation to determine whether illegality is going on someplace in the company? Well, what does that mean? Now, I believe it's I belive the CES says, I believe that nobody in this company is paying bribes. And the CEO says no one from it's a true statement of belief, and he's received information from certain corporate compliance officers that no bribes are being paid. How much investigation does he have to go on, does he have to do? Does he have to hire an outside firm to do an investigation to see if maybe somebody is paying bribes? Well, I understand that. He says it's purely subjective. You say basically, it's the state of mind is completely irrelevant. But if we're in the middle someplace? But you're not really helping me. But maybe all you're saying is reasonable, reasonable, reasonable. I I would like some more concrete guidance as to what is reasonable. But this is always going to come up after it's been shown that the statement turned out the statement of belief turned out to be incorrect. The registration statements says, We believe X. It turns out X is not true. So it's not going to be very hard in that situation for a plaintiff to allege that he that the issuer did not make a reasonable investigation because if if they had done a reasonable investigation, they would have discovered that X wasn't true. They say, someone pleads that they said we believe there were no bribes paid, and then later it's discovered that lots of bribes were being paid off someplace. So they alleged all the things that have turned out to be inconsistent with the statement of belief, and they say had they sent someone there to investigate, they would have found this, they would have found that. So how difficult is that going to be? Well, do you think that Twombly in this in this context requires the plaintiff to allege what kind of investigation was conducted before there is discovery?

I suspect, maybe I'm wrong and you tell me if I am, that in a case where there's a lot at stake, a really good lawyer loses a case and there was a lot on the line. And let's suppose this lawyer gets a transcript of what was said in the jury room. Do you think it is going to be very hard for the lawyer to find something that some juror said that can be used to make out a somewhat plausible claim that the -- that the juror was dishonest during voir dire? The juror promises during voir dire to be fair, and it appears from this transcript the lawyer was for the plaintiff or for the defendant from the first minute of deliberations. Or the juror says, I will follow the jury instructions. And then at some point, the juror is making an argument that's inconsistent with the jury instructions. Do you see the problem? A party has a right to a competent jury, doesn't it? Constitutional right to that. And yet, you couldn't inquire -- we -- the Court has held that there can't be an inquiry into whether the jurors were intoxicated? And why not? What would happen in the really egregious case? The jurors are asked during voir dire, can you be fair to every -- to parties regardless of race. Oh, yes, yes, we can. And then after there's a verdict, a juror comes -- comes forward and says during the jury deliberations, the jurors were making all kinds of biased statements and they were clearly prejudiced. What would happen there? ",i think you be miss the point of justice ginsburg s question the question be not whether the mcdonough claim ultimately would prevail the question be whether the testimony from juror about what go on in the jury room be go to be solicit in an effort to prove a mcdonough claim and i guess your answer to what be implicit in what you be say be that it would be permissible to receive that testimony in that situation this be what troubles me about your your argument i suspect maybe I be wrong and you tell me if i be that in a case where there be a lot at stake a really good lawyer lose a case and there be a lot on the line and let us suppose this lawyer get a transcript of what be say in the jury room do you think it be go to be very hard for the lawyer to find something that some juror say that can be use to make out a somewhat plausible claim that the that the juror be dishonest during voir dire the juror promise during voir dire to be fair and it appear from this transcript the lawyer be for the plaintiff or for the defendant from the first minute of deliberation or the juror say i will follow the jury instruction and then at some point the juror be make an argument that be inconsistent with the jury instruction do you see the problem a party have a right to a competent jury do not it constitutional right to that and yet you could not inquire we the court have hold that there can not be an inquiry into whether the juror we be intoxicate and why not what would happen in the really egregious case the juror be ask during voir dire can you be fair to every to party regardless of race oh yes yes we can and then after there be a verdict a juror come come forward and say during the jury deliberation the juror we be make all kind of biased statement and they we be clearly prejudice what would happen there ,122.43000000000004,Roberts Court,"Oct 8, 2014",Gregory P.

2014,Zivotofsky v. Kerry,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","May I ask you another -- another factual question? When Menachem was born, was he issued a birth certificate by the Israeli authorities? And the United States recognizes that as -- as a lawful exercise of Israeli authority, to issue a birth certificate for a child born in Jerusalem? So what -- this is a question I would ask the Solicitor General, but I don't completely understand what the position of the United States is regarding Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem. I understand it is the position of the United States that Israel does not exercise full sovereignty over Jerusalem, but in that -- in this instance, the issuance of a birth certificate, and others I can think of, I suspect the United States recognizes that Israel is lawfully exercising attributes of sovereignty over the territory of Jerusalem. Is that correct? So if someone -- let's say an American citizen committed a crime in Jerusalem, would the United States take the position that the Israeli government has no lawful authority to prosecute that person for the crime? If an American citizen is born in Barcelona, Spain, is that citizen allowed, by the State Department, to put Barcelona as place of birth? And is that a -- is that a vanity plate for people who believe in Catalan independence? But is that really true? Suppose -- could Congress pass a law saying that every passport -- every passport issued to an American citizen must list the place of birth, including country, and that for this purpose, the country is the nation that issued the birth certificate to that individual? Could -- could Congress do that? Can I ask you the question I asked Ms. Lewin. What exactly is the position of the executive regarding Israel's exercise of sovereign powers in Jerusalem? Is it the case that it is the position of the executive that Israel cannot lawfully exercise any sovereign powers within Jerusalem? Well, it must have been accepted as evidence of birth or the passport would never have been issued. I thought you had to provide a birth certificate-- --in order to get that. If I think that that Congress generally -- that Congress has the authority under the Constitution to require identification information in passports and to specify the identification information that's included, if I -- if I believe that, then the effect of your argument, I guess, is that something that Congress can do is unconstitutional if it affects the recognition power -- the President's recognition authority in -- in some way. Is that the -- is that-- --Why would that be so? No matter how this Court decides, everyone will know what the position of the President is. Everyone will know what Congress thought when they passed this legislation. Whatever we do, that's not going to be changed, and our decision isn't going to be based on any view that we may have about whether Jerusalem should be regarded as part of Israel or the capital of Israel. So why will there be any effect on foreign policy except by people who will misunderstand the situation, either -- either because they really don't understand it or they will exploit it in some way? But Congress did that, so nothing that we do is going to change that or change what Congress thought. ",may i ask you another another factual question when menachem be bear be he issue a birth certificate by the israeli authority and the united state recognize that as as a lawful exercise of israeli authority to issue a birth certificate for a child bear in jerusalem so what this be a question i would ask the solicitor general but i do not completely understand what the position of the united state be regard israeli sovereignty over jerusalem i understand it be the position of the united state that israel do not exercise full sovereignty over jerusalem but in that in this instance the issuance of a birth certificate and others i can think of i suspect the united state recognize that israel be lawfully exercise attribute of sovereignty over the territory of jerusalem be that correct so if someone let us say an american citizen commit a crime in jerusalem would the united state take the position that the israeli government have no lawful authority to prosecute that person for the crime if an american citizen be bear in barcelona spain be that citizen allow by the state department to put barcelona as place of birth and be that a be that a vanity plate for people who believe in catalan independence but be that really true suppose could congress pass a law say that every passport every passport issue to an american citizen must list the place of birth include country and that for this purpose the country be the nation that issue the birth certificate to that individual could could congress do that can i ask you the question i ask ms lewin what exactly be the position of the executive regard israel s exercise of sovereign power in jerusalem be it the case that it be the position of the executive that israel can not lawfully exercise any sovereign power within jerusalem well it must have be accept as evidence of birth or the passport would never have be issue i think you have to provide a birth certificate in order to get that if i think that that congress generally that congress have the authority under the constitution to require identification information in passport and to specify the identification information that be include if i if i believe that then the effect of your argument i guess be that something that congress can do be unconstitutional if it affect the recognition power the president s recognition authority in in some way be that the be that why would that be so no matter how this court decide everyone will know what the position of the president be everyone will know what congress think when they pass this legislation whatever we do that be not go to be change and our decision be not go to be base on any view that we may have about whether jerusalem should be regard as part of israel or the capital of israel so why will there be any effect on foreign policy except by people who will misunderstand the situation either either because they really do not understand it or they will exploit it in some way but congress do that so nothing that we do be go to change that or change what congress think ,208.09000000000003,Roberts Court,"Nov 3, 2014","M.

But you said that a possession offense could qualify. So if someone possesses a nuclear bomb, that could qualify? A biological or chemical weapon, that could qualify? Well, how do we know that? You -- you could make the same argument that you've just made, that we don't know what the -- the risk is that this will, in the case of a biological weapon, the risk that it will cause an infection unintentionally. We don't know that. That statistic is no more available than the statistic on sawed-off shotguns, is it? How would you do that? You'd look at all the -- you try to -- to identify the universe of people who have possessed biological weapons and see how many times somebody has gotten infected unintentionally? So you would say the same thing about any weapon. Any firearm? Mortars? Mortars? Artillery pieces? Rockets would not be -- illegal possession of a rocket, that wouldn't be a violent felony in your submission. Maybe that's right. That's correct. What are -- what do you think is the basis for a State legislature's prohibiting the possession of a short-barreled shotgun or a short-barreled shotgun that is not properly registered? Well, do you think that those State legislatures came to the conclusion that there was a strong correlation between the possession of a short-barreled shotgun and the use of that weapon in committing crimes? Do you think Congress-- --had statistics before it when it listed the specifically enumerated offenses in the Armed Career Criminal Act? Is this the sort of thing with respect to which it is reasonable to expect that there will be empirical evidence, or is this the sort of thing, the sort of decision that legislatures make based in -- on an impressionistic way and taking into account common sense? Well, when they said burglary is a violent offense, do you think they had statistics about the percentage of all burglar -- of all burglaries that occur within the United States that result in violence? Well, if that is a reasonable conclusion for the national legislature to reach in enacting the Armed Career Criminal Act, why is it not equally defensible for a State legislature to make the same decision with respect to the illegal possession of a sawed-off shotgun? Do you think that that judgment on the part of legislature is entitled to any respect from this Court? Well, that's what I'm talking about, the cases where it is possessed illegally, either because it is flatly banned or that it is possessed by somebody who will not register it for whatever reason, very possibly because that person doesn't want it known that he or she possesses the weapon. Has any legislature prohibited the possession of explosives? They just flatly prohibited, within our State, you cannot possess any explosives. Has any legislature done that? Well, do you think it's a possibility that there are States in which explosives cannot be used for demolition purposes? In the Armed Career Criminal Act in general, and the residual clause in particular, has caused no end of problems for this Court.

2014,"Young v. United Parcel Service, Inc.",112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, you read that as a-- --You read that as an accommodation provision basically, and maybe -- maybe it is. But let me ask you this question, which goes to the the issue of -- of whether the types of accommodations that you would say are required have to meet some reasonableness standard. Let's say there are two categories of employees who have lifting restrictions in their job descriptions. One consists of people who work alone and they lift all the time. A driver who is driving a truck by herself and has to lift heavy packages all the time would fall into that category. The second category would consist of people who lift more occasionally, and they do it in a place where there will always be lots of other employees in the same class available to do the lifting. Now, if an accommodation is provided to the workers in the second category, would you say that one must also be provided to workers in the first? But why -- why doesn't that fit why doesn't that second class fit within your reading of the statutory text? But I think you're reading you have admitted that other persons can't really be read literally. Other you have to read things into it. And you would read into it people in the same job classification. But if you can do that, then why can't you also read into it people whose injuries, whose disabilities have the same source? What if the language after the semicolon were not there? Would the language before the semicolon have effectively overruled Gilbert? Would it have produced a different result in Gilbert? Suppose the employer has a policy of providing certain benefits for employees who have an injury or a disease but not pregnancy. If you didn't have the language after the semicolon, would the language before the semicolon have required the employer to treat pregnant women the same as those who have an illness or an injury? Isn't that the reason for the language after the semicolon? Because you have to go further in order to produce a different result than Gilbert. And if that's correct, could you explain what you think the language after the semicolon means. Is there really a dispute about this? Maybe Petitioner's counsel could address it in rebuttal, but is there really a dispute that if a UPS driver fell off his all-terrain vehicle during -- on the weekend and was unable to lift that that person would not be given light duty? Is there really a-- You really think that you could prove at trial that if somebody is injured in a recreational activity over the weekend that they get light duty but a pregnant women does not maybe? ",well you read that as a you read that as an accommodation provision basically and maybe maybe it be but let me ask you this question which go to the the issue of of whether the type of accommodation that you would say be require have to meet some reasonableness standard let us say there be two category of employee who have lift restriction in their job description one consist of people who work alone and they lift all the time a driver who be drive a truck by herself and have to lift heavy package all the time would fall into that category the second category would consist of people who lift more occasionally and they do it in a place where there will always be lot of other employee in the same class available to do the lifting now if an accommodation be provide to the worker in the second category would you say that one must also be provide to worker in the first but why why do not that fit why do not that second class fit within your reading of the statutory text but i think you be read you have admit that other person can not really be read literally other you have to read thing into it and you would read into it people in the same job classification but if you can do that then why can not you also read into it people whose injury whose disability have the same source what if the language after the semicolon we be not there would the language before the semicolon have effectively overrule gilbert would it have produce a different result in gilbert suppose the employer have a policy of provide certain benefit for employee who have an injury or a disease but not pregnancy if you do not have the language after the semicolon would the language before the semicolon have require the employer to treat pregnant woman the same as those who have an illness or an injury be not that the reason for the language after the semicolon because you have to go far in order to produce a different result than gilbert and if that be correct could you explain what you think the language after the semicolon mean be there really a dispute about this maybe petitioner s counsel could address it in rebuttal but be there really a dispute that if a ups driver fell off his all terrain vehicle during on the weekend and be unable to lift that that person would not be give light duty be there really a you really think that you could prove at trial that if somebody be injure in a recreational activity over the weekend that they get light duty but a pregnant woman do not maybe ,163.95,Roberts Court,"Dec 3, 2014",Peggy Young,"United Parcel Service, Inc.",12-1226,"Jul 1, 2014","Mar 25, 2015",112,1.0,1.0,1.0,1
2014,"Reed et al. v. Town of Gilbert, Arizona et al.",112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","What if it's commercial and it relates to a one-time event. For example, for a yard sale. If the State and the city allow election-related signs to be put up in the right-of-way, then anybody who has a yard sale has an equal right? Well, what would happen if one church has a -- always meets in the same place and it wants to put up a sign that says, every Sunday this is the place to go, and another church moves around, so it wants to put up a temporary sign. Do they have to be treated the same? Can the town say that signs relating to a one-time event, an election or anything else that occurs on a particular date, have to be taken down within a period of time after that event? And if can say that, isn't that content-based, the way you define that concept? I thought you said the way you distinguish between temporary signs and permanent signs is based on the -- the nature of the sign, not what it says. So that gets you over the problem Justice Sotomayor mentioned about having to read the sign. But if this -- if there's a rule that says the sign has to be down within a certain period of time after the date of the event, which is on the sign, I don't see how you get around to reading the sign. So if somebody puts up a sign for a yard sale two days before the yard sale, then they can -- that can stay up for 48 days after the yard sale? It has 50 days or whatever the period of time is? You can make that argument in all kinds of contexts. I don't know where it gets you. Suppose that the question is, whether the town is going to allow anybody to speak in a park, and the town -- the town council says, well, you know, we would like to have people be able to speak on subjects that we like, but there are some subjects we really don't like. We don't want people to speak on those. So we have the choice, we allow everybody to speak or we allow nobody to speak. You can make exactly that same argument in lots of other contexts where I don't think the distinction could be justified. Isn't that right? Well, how do you justify the -- the differing treatments of Petitioner's sign, on the one hand, and the weekend builder event signs and homeowners' association signs? Homeowners' association signs can be 80 square feet, and the Petitioner's sign can be 6 square feet. Suppose the Petitioners want to put up a sign that says, we're having a church service at 10:00 o'clock on Sunday morning. Under your code, when can they put that up and when do they have to take it down? So they can put it up after dark on Saturday and then they have to take it down within an hour after, when, the commencement of the service, or-- --the end of this-- --Do you think that really gives them an opportunity to invite people to come to their service? So they could put up a, quote/unquote, ideological sign that says, ""Come to our service on Sunday morning. "" but no arrow, and then they put up another sign that says, this is the arrow? Or maybe they put up on the first sign, ""Come to our service on Sunday morning; we can't tell you now where it will be because the town won't let us, but if you come -- if you drive by here tomorrow morning at a certain time, you will see an arrow. "" [Laughter] ",what if it be commercial and it relate to a one time event for example for a yard sale if the state and the city allow election relate sign to be put up in the right of way then anybody who have a yard sale have an equal right well what would happen if one church have a always meet in the same place and it want to put up a sign that say every sunday this be the place to go and another church move around so it want to put up a temporary sign do they have to be treat the same can the town say that sign relate to a one time event an election or anything else that occur on a particular date have to be take down within a period of time after that event and if can say that be not that content base the way you define that concept i think you say the way you distinguish between temporary sign and permanent sign be base on the the nature of the sign not what it say so that get you over the problem justice sotomayor mention about have to read the sign but if this if there be a rule that say the sign have to be down within a certain period of time after the date of the event which be on the sign i do not see how you get around to read the sign so if somebody put up a sign for a yard sale two day before the yard sale then they can that can stay up for day after the yard sale it have day or whatever the period of time be you can make that argument in all kind of context i do not know where it get you suppose that the question be whether the town be go to allow anybody to speak in a park and the town the town council say well you know we would like to have people be able to speak on subject that we like but there be some subject we really do not like we do not want people to speak on those so we have the choice we allow everybody to speak or we allow nobody to speak you can make exactly that same argument in lot of other context where i do not think the distinction could be justify be not that right well how do you justify the the differ treatment of petitioner s sign on the one hand and the weekend builder event sign and homeowner association sign homeowner association sign can be square foot and the petitioner s sign can be square foot suppose the petitioner want to put up a sign that say we be have a church service at of the clock on sunday morning under your code when can they put that up and when do they have to take it down so they can put it up after dark on saturday and then they have to take it down within an hour after when the commencement of the service or the end of this do you think that really give them an opportunity to invite people to come to their service so they could put up a quoteunquote ideological sign that say come to our service on sunday morning but no arrow and then they put up another sign that say this be the arrow or maybe they put up on the first sign come to our service on sunday morning we can not tell you now where it will be because the town will not let us but if you come if you drive by here tomorrow morning at a certain time you will see an arrow laughter ,194.36,Roberts Court,"Jan 12, 2015","Clyde Reed, et al.","Town of Gilbert, Arizona, et al.",13-502,"Jul 1, 2014","Jun 18, 2015",112,1.0,1.0,1.0,1

A friend, let's say. Let's say it's a friend who lives two blocks away. Now, if this friend doesn't -- is not himself a convicted felon or doesn't have some other aspect of his record that would prevent him from buying a firearm, he could go to a licensed firearm dealer, presumably, and purchase it directly; right? So why should the situation -- and that would be true even though he is a friend of the convicted felon, and there might be some risk that he would allow the convicted felon to use the firearm. So why should the situation be different when the district court is considering whether the firearm can be transferred from the convicted felon to this individual? But I thought you understood -- I though you were saying that the district court would have the discretion to prevent that transfer if the district court thought there was some risk that this individual would allow the convicted felon to have access to the firearm.

So what -- how can that person deal with the firearms in the house without exercising constructive possession in your view? Would the firearms dealer charge a commission for selling these guns?

If you've got 5,000 different variations that people can create for themselves, it becomes a lot harder to say that's government speech. So where would you draw the line?

",suppose texas erect electronic billboard around the state and on those billboard they post some government message wear your seatbelt when you be drive for example but then at the bottom people could put a message of their choice would that be government speech no the bottom the government have the same kind of approval authority that it have here it will allow people to say inoffensive thing but if they say something that be that be offensive then they will not allow that that would be government speech what be the limit of this argument that be what concern me and your answer to my billboard question be disturb but suppose people still do go to park and the state have an official state soapbox at the park and every once in a while a state official would mount the soapbox and say give some official state announcement but other time people who pay the fee would be allow to go up there and say something that they want provide that it be approve in advance by the state would that be official state speech well what do well i do not want to beat a dead horse but i if what what be the best distinction you can give me between what you do with license plate and billboard a soapbox an official state website where people can put up a a message that they want subject to state approval if we we be to write an opinion that draw try to draw a distinction between the license plat on one side and those other thing on the other side what would we say texas have its name on all the other thing too suppose the state have many few plate from which to choose so let us say they have the standard plate and then they have a plate for every college or university in the state that be your choice would that be government speech all right suppose they broaden it so it be not only the college and university but it be all the place in texas of historic interest or natural feature of the state how about that now you have get a lot more and suppose that there be some little town that think that it be really scenic and they there be a way in which they can petition to get on this list do you see where I be go at some point if it be if you have just a standard state plate of course that be government speech if you have get different variation that people can create for themselves it become a lot hard to say that be government speech so where would you draw the line do you know how much money texas make from this that be really all this be about be not it ,160.86,Roberts Court,"Mar 23, 2015","John Walker, III, et al.","Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans, Inc., et al.",14-144,"Dec 5, 2014","Jun 18, 2015",112,1.0,0.0,1.0,0
2014,Elonis v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","I thought your answer to Justice Kagan a few minutes ago was that it is not necessary for the defendant to have the purpose of causing fear, but it's sufficient for the -- for the defendant to have knowledge that it will cause fear. Which of the two is it? I thought a minute ago, though, in answering Justice Kennedy, I thought you said that intent, which I take to mean purpose, is what's necessary. So you say it's knowledge -- knowledge that will cause fear on the part of whom? The -- an average recipient or the particular recipient? Well, let me give you a concrete example. This is one of the communications in this case for which your -- your client was convicted. This is on -- this is Government Exhibit 6 on 335 of the Joint Appendix. ""Tone Dougie: That's it. "" ""I've had about enough. "" ""I'm checking out and making a name for myself. "" ""Enough elementary schools in a ten-mile radius to initiate the most heinous school shooting ever imagined and hell hath no fury like a crazy man in a kindergarten class. "" ""The only question is which one. "" And then there's some individual who likes this. He puts a thumb up to this -- to this comment. Now, suppose that this was altered a little bit, so at the bottom he puts, just kidding, just kidding laughing out loud. And at the top he puts, Tone Dougie, aspiring rap artist. Okay? What's a jury to do with that under your theory? That you have to get into the mind of this obsessed, somewhat disturbed individual to tell -- to -- to figure out whether he really knew that this would cause a panic on the part of the school officials and parents who found out about this? Yes, that's the answer? You think that's what Congress intended. Congress wanted to say, this is okay, it's all going to turn on this inquiry into a really strange psychological state. My understanding of the Model Penal Code levels of mens rea is that there is a distinction, but a razor-thin distinction, between purpose and knowledge. So the idea that backing off from purpose to knowledge is going to make very much practical difference, I think is fanciful. There is a considerable difference between -- distance between knowledge and recklessness. Do you agree with that or do I not understand that correctly. Well, this is -- well, why is this really a question of mens rea? What was required by the statute is that some thing be transmitted in interstate commerce, and the thing is a threat. So the question is what is this thing? Is it a thing that is intended to cause fear, or is it a thing that just naturally causes fear? Why is that -- I see your time is up, but I wish you had time to answer it. Why is that a question of mens rea? Well, this sounds like a roadmap for threatening a spouse and getting away with it. So you -- you put it in rhyme and you put some stuff about the Internet on it and you say, I'm an aspiring rap artist. And so then you are free from prosecution. Well, what do you say to the to the amici who say that if your position is adopted, this is going to have a very grave effect in cases of domestic violence?

We have before us a case involving a particular person. She did something and she was disciplined for it. So don't we have to compare what she did and some -- the thing which is regarded by the Florida law as being unethical, and what she could have done, and see whether there -- the incremental difference has any significant relationship to any interest that this rule is supposed to serve? Does it -- was there a greater danger of quid pro quo corruption or the appearance of corruption or bias or coercion, the difference between what she did and what she could have done? And what she could have done as I understood your answers is the following: She could have -- a letter could have been sent by a committee and the letter could have -- could have said that Petitioner gave us your name and asked us to solicit a contribution from you, and that's what we're doing. And the letter could either say, ""and we'll let the judge know if you gave a contribution. "" and -- or the candidate know, and she can write you a thank-you note, she will write you a thank-you note if you contributed. Or, you speak for the Florida bar, so you said it would be okay to put that in the letter, but if that's not, at least you could put in the letter and under the Florida law the candidate can see the list of people who contributed. So those are the two situations. Now why was there any greater damage done by what she did as opposed to what you admit she could have done?

2014,City of Los Angeles v. Patel,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Go ahead. This is a facial challenge. Now, are there any or a substantial number of instances in which the application of this statute would be constitutional? Suppose that a city or a State wanted to establish an administrative inspection regime along the lines of Barlow's? What would it -- what would it have to include in your judgment? Could they -- could the warrant be issued by an administrative law judge -- -- as opposed to a superior court judge in California? Would it have -- would it require probable cause? Could they -- could it be done without prior notice? Could you have different standards for different types of hotels? Periodic inspections for all hotels, but much more frequent inspections for hotels that rent by the hour, hotels that have a large number of guests who pay in cash, and so forth? All those things could be done. Now if that's okay, it's really not clear to me what that would add to the ordinance that we have before us. That's a seizure. That is a seizure. So why is that justified and looking at the information not? Yeah, that's if it has probable cause. I'm confused by your answer. I thought you said in response to my earlier questions that the city could have a regime under which an administrative law judge issues a warrant, not a subpoena -- -- for a periodic inspection. So the -- the officer would have the warrant, would go to the hotel, here's the warrant, this is your periodic inspection. There would be no pre-judicial review. There could be a challenge to it later. Right. This is -- I didn't quite understand your question about harassment. Maybe it's because -- maybe this is in the record or maybe it's because this wasn't as applied. But the police -- even if this ordinance were invalidated, the police could show up whenever they wanted, couldn't they, and ask for the -- the owner or the person at the desk voluntarily to disclose the register so there could be -- they could be in the lobby as much as they want. So exactly what does -- how does this aid in harassment of hotels? No, but it's a private -- it's a public space. I don't know whether it's dispositive, but it's of some relevance. So they walk in -- there are two scenarios; one, with the ordinance, one, without. Without the ordinance, they walk in and they said, would you, in the kindness of your heart, let us look at the register. And the owner says, no, I don't want to. And then they come back the next day and they do the same thing. Okay? That's the first scenario. The second one is, they come in and they say, let us see the register. You show them the register, and what? It's a harassment because they sit there for a while and the guests coming in see the police in the lobby? I just don't understand factually. A subpoena -- a subpoena is worthless when what is sought is something that can be easily destroyed, hidden or falsified. It's -- it's very useful if you're trying to get complicated records that can't be easily altered between the time when the subpoena is issued and the time when the subpoena is enforced. But nobody -- nobody issues a subpoena for the murder weapon that one is -- you know, that you suspect is in somebody's house. So these records are more like the murder weapon where there's something that can be easily falsified. You -- you seem to concede when you say that the police can seize them, then -- then the subpoena is worthless. You think -- you think payroll records in general are no more complicated than the ledger at a motel that runs by the hour? ",go ahead this be a facial challenge now be there any or a substantial number of instance in which the application of this statute would be constitutional suppose that a city or a state want to establish an administrative inspection regime along the line of barlow s what would it what would it have to include in your judgment could they could the warrant be issue by an administrative law judge as oppose to a superior court judge in california would it have would it require probable because could they could it be do without prior notice could you have different standard for different type of hotel periodic inspection for all hotel but much more frequent inspection for hotel that rent by the hour hotel that have a large number of guest who pay in cash and so forth all those thing could be do now if that be okay it be really not clear to me what that would add to the ordinance that we have before us that be a seizure that be a seizure so why be that justified and look at the information not yeah that have if it have probable because I be confuse by your answer i think you say in response to my early question that the city could have a regime under which an administrative law judge issue a warrant not a subpoena for a periodic inspection so the the officer would have the warrant would go to the hotel here s the warrant this be your periodic inspection there would be no pre judicial review there could be a challenge to it later right this be i do not quite understand your question about harassment maybe it be because maybe this be in the record or maybe it be because this be not as apply but the police even if this ordinance we be invalidate the police could show up whenever they want could not they and ask for the the owner or the person at the desk voluntarily to disclose the register so there could be they could be in the lobby as much as they want so exactly what do how do this aid in harassment of hotel no but it be a private it be a public space i do not know whether it be dispositive but it be of some relevance so they walk in there be two scenario one with the ordinance one without without the ordinance they walk in and they say would you in the kindness of your heart let us look at the register and the owner say no i do not want to and then they come back the next day and they do the same thing okay that be the first scenario the second one be they come in and they say let us see the register you show them the register and what it be a harassment because they sit there for a while and the guest come in see the police in the lobby i just do not understand factually a subpoena a subpoena be worthless when what be seek be something that can be easily destroy hidden or falsify it be it be very useful if you be try to get complicate record that can not be easily alter between the time when the subpoena be issue and the time when the subpoena be enforce but nobody nobody issue a subpoena for the murder weapon that one be you know that you suspect be in somebody s house so these record be more like the murder weapon where there be something that can be easily falsify you you seem to concede when you say that the police can seize them then then the subpoena be worthless you think you think payroll record in general be no more complicated than the ledger at a motel that run by the hour ,207.5,Roberts Court,"Mar 3, 2015",City of Los Angeles,"Naranjibhai Patel, et al.",13-1175,"Oct 20, 2014","Jun 22, 2015",112,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2014,Department of Homeland Security v. MacLean,112,"Samuel A.

Would this -- this would be classified information and then only people with certain security clearances would be -- no? No. I'm talking about Justice Breyer's alternative. I'm sorry. Go ahead. Can I ask you about that? You say in your brief Mr. MacLean contacted a reporter with a history of responsible reporting about TSA who maintains close connections with Congress. Now, suppose that he instead contacted a reporter working for a foreign state-controlled news agency and the information was not quickly released to the public, so that the information was out there and could have been obtained, perhaps, by terrorists before Congress was aware of this and before the agency was aware of it and before it was able to take corrective action. Would there be any reason why that would not fall under the statute, as you understand it? Well that may be. But I doubt if Congress had thought about the situation that I posited, they would be content with the possibility of a disclosure that wasn't really a disclosure to the full public. Mr. Katyal, if you agree with the suggestion that this could be remedied by the President through an executive order, could I -- do you agree with that? Now, could I ask you how that would -- how that would work out? Let's say -- let's just take this example. Suppose the information in question concerns the -- the layout in a particular airport. There's an area that -- that some employee of the TSA thinks is not secure. So that's the information. Then the information comes out that there's this problem with that particular airport and the -- the TSA employee thinks that it's not being remedied, so this person wants to disclose it. Now, how would that -- this information has to be disclosed to a certain number of people associated with that airport in order for the problem to be remedied. So how would that be dealt with in an executive order? The President has to issue an executive order about that specific thing and say, this can be disclosed to security people at the airport, the local police, maintenance people who are going to fix that. How would you deal -- how would that be dealt with?

2014,Glossip v. Gross,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Did you introduce any evidence to show the dosage at which the ceiling effect would occur? Well, what if the ceiling effect is 1,000 milligrams? No. I'm just saying is there any evidence to show that it is any amount below 500? Of course it matters. Well, how many executions have been carried out using this drug? Yes. Okay. And you're talking about one. And why is Oklahoma not using sodium thiopental? Why is it not using that drug? You don't know? Yes. I mean, let's be honest about what's going on here. Executions could be carried out painlessly. There are many jurisdictions -- there are jurisdictions in this country, there are jurisdictions abroad that allow assisted suicide, and I assume that those are carried out with little, if any, pain. Oklahoma and other States could carry out executions painlessly. Now, this Court has held that the death penalty is constitutional. It's controversial as a constitutional matter. It certainly is controversial as a policy matter. Those who oppose the death penalty are free to try to persuade legislatures to abolish the death penalty. Some of those efforts have been successful. They're free to ask this Court to overrule the death penalty. But until that occurs, is it appropriate for the judiciary to countenance what amounts to a guerilla war against the death penalty which consists of efforts to make it impossible for the States to obtain drugs that could be used to carry out capital punishment with little, if any, pain? And so the States are reduced to using drugs like this one which give rise to disputes about whether, in fact, every possibility of pain is eliminated. Now, what is your response to that? And is that -- is that your argument? You're marking -- you can make one of two arguments. And one is that the death penalty is unconstitutional because there is no method that has been used in the past or that can be devised that is capable of carrying that sentence out without inflicting some pain, pain that's unacceptable. That's an argument that you can make. But I don't understand you to be making that argument; am I right? So you are arguing -- you want us to reverse a finding of fact of the district court on the ground that it is clearly erroneous. When was the last time we did that? But 500 milligrams is a lethal dose, isn't it? Itself it's capable of causing death; is that right? Well -- -- isn't a therapeutic dose -- is there -- is it ever administered in that quantity for any therapeutic reason? No, that -- but that's not the point. The point is, if it's a lethal dose, or it's potentially a lethal dose, then how are you going to do a study to determine whether, in fact, it renders the person insensate? If an -- if an anesthesiologist rendered a person completely unconscious, and then the person was burned alive, would that be cruel and unusual punishment? Yes. So an anesthesiologist is called in to make sure that this person feels no pain whatsoever while being burned alive, and then the person is burned alive, would that not be a violation of the Eighth Amendment anyway? But you're not sure that being burned alive -- that you think there are circumstances in which burning somebody at the stake would be consistent with the Eighth Amendment? It's an irrelevant point, but you're -- you're not certain about that? That's an incredible answer. You think that there are circumstances in which burning alive would not be a violation of the Eighth Amendment? Burning somebody alive would not be a violation of the Eighth Amendment? ",do you introduce any evidence to show the dosage at which the ceiling effect would occur well what if the ceiling effect be milligram no I be just say be there any evidence to show that it be any amount below of course it matter well how many execution have be carry out use this drug yes okay and you be talk about one and why be oklahoma not use sodium thiopental why be it not use that drug you do not know yes i mean let us be honest about what be go on here execution could be carry out painlessly there be many jurisdiction there be jurisdiction in this country there be jurisdiction abroad that allow assist suicide and i assume that those be carry out with little if any pain oklahoma and other state could carry out execution painlessly now this court have hold that the death penalty be constitutional it be controversial as a constitutional matter it certainly be controversial as a policy matter those who oppose the death penalty be free to try to persuade legislature to abolish the death penalty some of those effort have be successful they be free to ask this court to overrule the death penalty but until that occur be it appropriate for the judiciary to countenance what amount to a guerilla war against the death penalty which consist of effort to make it impossible for the state to obtain drug that could be use to carry out capital punishment with little if any pain and so the state be reduce to use drug like this one which give rise to dispute about whether in fact every possibility of pain be eliminate now what be your response to that and be that be that your argument you be mark you can make one of two argument and one be that the death penalty be unconstitutional because there be no method that have be use in the past or that can be devise that be capable of carry that sentence out without inflict some pain pain that be unacceptable that be an argument that you can make but i do not understand you to be make that argument be i right so you be argue you want us to reverse a finding of fact of the district court on the ground that it be clearly erroneous when be the last time we do that but milligram be a lethal dose be not it itself it be capable of cause death be that right well be not a therapeutic dose be there be it ever administer in that quantity for any therapeutic reason no that but that be not the point the point be if it be a lethal dose or it be potentially a lethal dose then how be you go to do a study to determine whether in fact it render the person insensate if an if an anesthesiologist render a person completely unconscious and then the person be burn alive would that be cruel and unusual punishment yes so an anesthesiologist be call in to make sure that this person feel no pain whatsoever while be burn alive and then the person be burn alive would that not be a violation of the eighth amendment anyway but you be not sure that be burn alive that you think there be circumstance in which burn somebody at the stake would be consistent with the eighth amendment it be an irrelevant point but you be you be not certain about that that be an incredible answer you think that there be circumstance in which burn alive would not be a violation of the eighth amendment burn somebody alive would not be a violation of the eighth amendment ,213.70000000000007,Roberts Court,"Apr 29, 2015","Richard E.

Just say, do you have any problem with that? Are you willing to do it? Do you think that the -- do you think that the employee has to say, I am dressed the way I am for a religious reason? All right. Let's say four -- four people show up for a job interview at Abercrombie. And half -- this is going to sound like a joke, but, you know, it's not. (Laughter.) So the first is a Sikh man wearing a turban, the second is a Hasidic man wearing a hat, the third is a Muslim woman wearing a hijab, the fourth is a Catholic nun in a habit. Now, do you think the employer has to -- that those people have to say, we just want to tell you, we're dressed this way for a religious reason. We're not just trying to make a fashion statement. Well, that can be the case, but I want to know the answer to the question whether the employee has to say, I'm wearing this for a religious reason, or whether you're willing to admit that there are at least some circumstances in which the employer is charged with that knowledge based on what the employer observes. So let's say that somebody comes in for an interview and this person is -- has the look, if you wanted to, you know, draw the person who has the look, this is the person who has the look, looks just like this mythical preppy or -- (Laughter.) -- somebody who came off the beach in California. Only one problem, the person is wearing a black blouse, which is against the Abercrombie rules. Now, would Abercrombie fire that -- or would not hire that person on the assumption that this person likes black so much this person is going to wear black every single day? This is what I don't understand about your position with respect to this particular case. As I understand it, Abercrombie does not have a policy that the -- that an interviewee must comply with the Look Policy; is that correct? So what -- on -- there would be no reason for not hiring the individual involved here unless you assumed that she was going to wear a scarf every day. Just because she wore a headscarf on that one day, wouldn't mean that she necessarily was going to wear it everyday. Every day she might. Maybe she's just having a bad hair day so she comes in with a headscarf, but she doesn't have any religious reason for doing it. Would you reject her for that? No. The reason that she was rejected was because you assumed she was going to do this every day and the only reason why she would do it every day is because she had a religious reason.

2014,Direct Marketing Association v. Brohl,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","What about the Alexander v. Americans United case under the Anti-Injunction Act? That was not -- that was a third-party suit, wasn't it? An organization was -- wanted -- wanted a determination that contributions would be tax deductible. Can I ask a question about where your argument might lead? I think you acknowledged earlier that if we hold that your statute cannot be challenged under the Tax Injunction Act and it's ultimately determined to be constitutional, this would be very attractive for all the other States to copy. So let's -- let's suppose that that happens and so now every State has a law like this, and every State -- and there are many different variations in the forms. Maybe there are 50 forms that have to be submitted to State tax authorities. And let's say I start up a small business and I'm selling a few thousand dollars worth of goods via the internet to people from all over the country. Now I will have to submit potentially 50 different forms to all of these States reporting that somebody in South Carolina purchased something from me that cost 23.99. Now, I know you have a -- you have a requirement that it has to reach a certain threshold, but I don't see it and that's just something that you've chosen to do. But that's where this all could lead, couldn't it? Well, Congress wrote a statute with terms that seem most naturally read to have a technical meaning, restrain, suspend, enjoin, assess, levy, and collect. Those are not -- those are not the terms that one might use if one were speaking colloquially. Let me come back to Justice Kagan's pizza example. So her clerks are collecting money for pizza to be had at night and let's say the Chief Justice says this is fine, but you -- you may not use court e-mail to try to collect this. Now, would you say that the Chief Justice has restrained, suspended or enjoined the collection of the pizza money? You might say he's made it a little bit harder, maybe he's interfered with it. But would -- would anybody naturally use those technical terms. Well, let's say we're back in -- we're in the pre-internet era and I order something over the phone from an out-of-State vendor. So this vendor is going to mail it to me across State lines. And let's say this particular vendor is somebody who feels very strongly that everybody ought to pay taxes that are due. So this vendor voluntarily, once my order has been placed, says to me, now, I'm going to ship this to you in your State and I'm not going to charge you -- say I'm not going to make you pay sales tax in my State. I just want to remind you that you are obligated under the law of your State to pay use tax. Would you say that that vendor has assessed the use tax? Yes. Well, that's -- that's what you're arguing here, isn't it? That's exactly what happens. You would say that by saying that, making that illegal statement, they've enjoined the -- the payment of the tax? They have restrained it? Before your time expires, what's your best formulation of the connection that you think is required? The likely effect culminating in collection just seems to me that it benefits collection in some way. Could I just ask you to clarify your position on the State's alleged consent to this suit? Is it your argument that the Tax Injunction Act allows a Federal court to consider -- to entertain a case that would be otherwise barred by that Act if the State consents? If that's your position, do you have authority for it and have you raised this argument in your -- in your petition and in your brief?

Well, some of them are very technical, and I doubt that the -- the general public has any understanding of some very technical terms that appear in statutes. So would they not be read in light of what someone who is knowledgeable in that field would understand the -- the term to mean? Well, I'll give you an example. The Dodd-Frank Act refers to Tier 1 Capital. Do you think that the average person on the street has any idea what Tier 1 capital is? Among the general public or among people who are knowledgeable in that particular area? Isn't your-- --Go ahead. In a recent law review article written by two authors, one of whom is a -- is the deputy solicitor in the Patent and Trademark Office, the office -- the authors said that they surveyed a very large number of cases to try to find any in which the difference between de novo review and clear error review of factual questions by the Federal Circuit made a difference in the outcome and they couldn't find any case in which this fascinating legal debate had a practical significance. Now, you want to introduce a level of complication to this. The Federal Circuit says de novo for everything, and you want the court -- you want the Federal Circuit now to struggle to determine which are factual questions as to which there's clear error review, which ones get de novo review, whether it's the ultimate question. Is it worthwhile as a practical matter? And you say that factual findings that are subject to clear error review must be, quote, ""in some sense distinct from the meaning or validity of the patent. "" I don't understand what that means when the issue is the meaning or validity of the patent. If the evidence is -- is relevant, then it is -- there is a connection. So what does that mean, in some sense distinct? Well, that sounds like every factual finding. It sounds like you're saying that anything that is a factual issue is subject to clear error review. But I thought you were saying something less than that. So if a patent is-- --Mr. Phillips, can I try this out and see if you agree with me. If a patent is like public law, if it's like a statute or like a rule, then factual findings regarding the meaning of that patent are not entitled to clear error review. Any more than factual findings regarding the meaning of a statute are -- or the Constitution are entitled to plain error review. What was the original understanding of the Second Amendment? That's a factual question, but it's not subject to plain error review. What did Congress intend if you think Congress intended things? That's a factual question, but it's not subject to plain error review. Now, on the other hand, if a patent is private law, if it's like a deed or if it's like a contract, then Rule 52(a) comes into play. Do you agree with that?

And the 1988 amendments, which made it clear that there could not be disparate-impact analysis with respect to certain matters surely didn't expand the scope of the 19 -- of what was initially enacted. So the issue is what did Congress intend, what -- what is the meaning of the Act as originally enacted. I thought that was your argument. In Smith, however, the Court -- the plurality opinion cited two additional things. It didn't just say ""because of"" can mean disparate impact. It cited the effects language, which was the subject of some questioning during General Keller's argument, but it also cited the RFOA provision. Now, none of -- neither of those -- I think the latter is more significant and there's nothing like that in Title VIII, is there? So is that critical to your argument? That the exemptions are critical to your argument? If there was no disparate impact under the Act as initially enacted, do you argue that the exemptions expanded the Act so that it then, as of 1988, included disparate impact? Well, that wasn't really my question. What Congress thought the Act meant in 1988 wouldn't have any significance -- wouldn't have much significance if they hadn't done anything, would it? All right.

Should we be concerned here about the use of Chevron to manipulate the decisions of this Court? The -- the Fair Housing Act was enacted in 1968. For 40 years plus, there were no HUD regulations.

2014,Obergefell v. Hodges,112,"Samuel A.

And did -- did you say in your brief that the primary purpose of that was to demean gay people? Is that true just in Michigan or is that true of -- of every other State that has a similar definition of marriage? Well, how do you account for the fact that, as far as I'm aware, until the end of the 20th century, there never was a nation or a culture that recognized marriage between two people of the same sex? Now, can we infer from that that those nations and those cultures all thought that there was some rational, practical purpose for defining marriage in that way or is it your argument that they were all operating independently based solely on irrational stereotypes and prejudice? I don't really think you answered my question. Can we infer that these societies all thought there was a rational reason for this and a practical reason for this? But there have been cultures that did not frown on homosexuality. That is not a universal opinion throughout history and across all cultures. Ancient Greece is an example. It was -- it was well accepted within certain bounds. But did they have same-sex marriage in ancient Greece? Well, they had marriage, didn't they? And they had -- and they had same-sex relations, did they not? People like Plato wrote in favor of that, did he not? Same-sex -- wrote approvingly of same-sex relationships, did he not? So their limiting marriage to couples of the opposite sex was not based on prejudice against gay people, was it? Suppose we rule in your favor in this case and then after that, a group consisting of two men and two women apply for a marriage license. Would there be any ground for denying them a license? What would be the reason? Yes. I hope you will come back to mine. If you want to go back to the earlier one -- -- then you can come back to mine. Well, what if there's no -- these are 4 people, 2 men and 2 women, it's not -- it's not the sort of polygamous relationship, polygamous marriages that existed in other societies and still exist in some societies today. And let's say they're all consenting adults, highly educated. They're all lawyers. (Laughter.) What would be the ground under -- under the logic of the decision you would like us to hand down in this case? What would be the logic of denying them the same right? But -- well, I don't know what kind of a distinction that is because a marriage between two people of the same sex is not something that we have had before, recognizing that is a substantial break. Maybe it's a good one. So this is no -- why is that a greater break? What do you think -- -- are the essential elements of marriage as it exists today? Well, let's -- let's think about two groups of two people. The first is the same-sex couple who have been together for 25 years, and they get married either as a result of a change in State law or as a result of a Court decision. The second two people are unmarried siblings. They've lived together for 25 years. Their financial relationship is the same as the -- the same-sex couple. They share household expenses and household chores in the same way. They care for each other in the same way. Is there any reason why the law should treat the two groups differently? Well, as far as -- As far as the -- the benefits that Federal law confers on married people, such as in Windsor, the effect on estate taxes, what would be the reason for treating those two groups differently? Well, in the Bob Jones case, the Court held that a college was not entitled to tax-exempt status if it opposed interracial marriage or interracial dating. So would the same apply to a university or a college if it opposed same-sex marriage? If the reason -- -- the reason for marriage is to provide a lasting bond between people who love each other and make a commitment to take care of each other, I'm not -- do you see a way in which that logic can be limited to two people who want to have sexual relations -- -- why that would not extend to larger groups, the one I mentioned earlier, two men and two women, or why it would not extend to unmarried siblings who have the same sort of relationship? I was somewhat surprised by the arguments you made in your brief because they are largely a repetition of the arguments that we just heard with respect to Question 1. I thought the point of Question 2 was whether there would be a -- an obligation to recognize a same-sex marriage entered into in another State where that is lawful even if the State itself, constitutionally, does not recognize same-sex marriage. I thought that's the question in Question 2. Is -- am I wrong? What if it's not a plural relationship? What if one State says that individuals can marry at the age of puberty? So a 12-year-old female can marry. Would a State -- would another State be obligated to recognize that marriage? You're saying that -- You're saying that the laws in some States, the States that you're referring to that recognize only opposite-sex marriage are pretextual? Well -- -- other than the distinction -- we have the distinction between same-sex marriage and opposite-sex marriage. What is the next most dramatic variation that exists in the marriage laws of the States? At the present time, what is -- -- most -- the next most dramatic difference? Well -- well, I had asked a simple question. At the present time, what is the next most dramatic variation in the marriage laws of the States? And what is the -- what -- what's the range? Well, I thought you answered me earlier that a State could refuse to recognize a marriage in -- contracted in another State where the minimum age was puberty. This second question puts both you and Mr. Hallward-Driemeier in a very unusual situation, because, first of all, we have to assume that this first question has been decided against the Petitioner, or we wouldn't get to the second question. So we have to assume that we would hold that a State has a sufficient reason for limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples. And Mr. Hallward-Driemeier acknowledged that a State could refuse to recognize an out-of-state marriage if it has a very strong public policy against that marriage, if it's a polygamous marriage, if it's a -- a marriage of very young individuals. So the question is whether there could be something in between. So there -- there's a -- a sufficient reason to -- for the State to say, we're not going to grant these licenses ourselves, but not a strong enough reason for us not to recognize a marriage performed out of state. I suppose that's possible, isn't it? ",you argue in your you argue in your brief that the primary purpose of the michigan law limit marriage to a man and a woman be to demean gay people be that correct and do do you say in your brief that the primary purpose of that be to demean gay people be that true just in michigan or be that true of of every other state that have a similar definition of marriage well how do you account for the fact that as far as I be aware until the end of the th century there never be a nation or a culture that recognize marriage between two people of the same sex now can we infer from that that those nation and those culture all think that there be some rational practical purpose for define marriage in that way or be it your argument that they we be all operate independently base solely on irrational stereotype and prejudice i do not really think you answer my question can we infer that these society all think there be a rational reason for this and a practical reason for this but there have be culture that do not frown on homosexuality that be not a universal opinion throughout history and across all culture ancient greece be an example it be it be well accept within certain bound but do they have same sex marriage in ancient greece well they have marriage do not they and they have and they have same sex relation do they not people like plato write in favor of that do he not same sex write approvingly of same sex relationship do he not so their limiting marriage to couple of the opposite sex be not base on prejudice against gay people be it suppose we rule in your favor in this case and then after that a group consist of two men and two woman apply for a marriage license would there be any ground for deny them a license what would be the reason yes i hope you will come back to mine if you want to go back to the early one then you can come back to mine well what if there be no these be people men and woman it be not it be not the sort of polygamous relationship polygamous marriage that exist in other society and still exist in some society today and let us say they be all consent adult highly educate they be all lawyer laughter what would be the ground under under the logic of the decision you would like us to hand down in this case what would be the logic of deny them the same right but well i do not know what kind of a distinction that be because a marriage between two people of the same sex be not something that we have have before recognize that be a substantial break maybe it be a good one so this be no why be that a great break what do you think be the essential element of marriage as it exist today well let us let us think about two group of two people the first be the same sex couple who have be together for year and they get married either as a result of a change in state law or as a result of a court decision the second two people be unmarried sibling they have live together for year their financial relationship be the same as the the same sex couple they share household expense and household chore in the same way they care for each other in the same way be there any reason why the law should treat the two group differently well as far as as far as the the benefit that federal law confers on married people such as in windsor the effect on estate tax what would be the reason for treat those two group differently well in the bob jones case the court hold that a college be not entitle to tax exempt status if it oppose interracial marriage or interracial dating so would the same apply to a university or a college if it oppose same sex marriage if the reason the reason for marriage be to provide a lasting bond between people who love each other and make a commitment to take care of each other I be not do you see a way in which that logic can be limit to two people who want to have sexual relation why that would not extend to large group the one i mention earlier two men and two woman or why it would not extend to unmarried sibling who have the same sort of relationship i be somewhat surprised by the argument you make in your brief because they be largely a repetition of the argument that we just hear with respect to question i think the point of question be whether there would be a an obligation to recognize a same sex marriage enter into in another state where that be lawful even if the state itself

the age of puberty so a year old female can marry would a state would another state be obligate to recognize that marriage you be say that you be say that the law in some state the state that you be refer to that recognize only opposite sex marriage be pretextual well other than the distinction we have the distinction between same sex marriage and opposite sex marriage what be the next most dramatic variation that exist in the marriage law of the state at the present time what be most the next most dramatic difference well well i have ask a simple question at the present time what be the next most dramatic variation in the marriage law of the state and what be the what what be the range well i think you answer me early that a state could refuse to recognize a marriage in contract in another state where the minimum age be puberty this second question put both you and mr hallward driemeier in a very unusual situation because first of all we have to assume that this first question

Or is it that nothing more can be done after the ticket is issued? In other words, is it the length of time or is it the formal act of giving the ticket or the warning that -- that cuts things off? And conducting a dog sniff. That also, right? If we hold that it's okay to have a dog sniff so long as it's before the ticket is issued, then every police officer other than those who are uninformed or incompetent will delay the handing over of the ticket until the dog sniff is completed. So what has that -- what does that accomplish? I mean, it's great for your client, but what does it do for the law? If we adopt a formal rule, that's one of -- one of the options, a formal rule, once you hand over the ticket, that's it, you can't do anything more. The person has to be allowed to go. All right? Is that your argument or not? That is your argument. Then what does it accomplish? Why is that part of the mission and the dog sniff is not? That's the question.

I can understand that, but is that your argument? I mean, your answer is -- I don't want to interrupt. Your answer is that the courts have accepted that you can go -- you can prolong this a little bit to do a records check. But then you have to explain why the dog sniff is different. What do you say about the questioning that took place in this case? Where are you going? Are you going to buy a car someplace? All of that, was that -- is that part of the mission? Well, one of those courts is this Court and what -- that's what I don't understand about your position, is the definition of the mission. I don't understand -- I can understand a definition that says, just what you need to do to resolve the traffic violation, period.

2014,King v. Burwell,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, Mr. Carvin, if I had those clerks, I had the same clerks -- (Laughter.) -- and Amanda wrote the memo, and I received it and I said, This is a great memo, who wrote it? Would the answer be it was written by Will, because Amanda stepped into Will's shoes? Mr. Carvin, if I were a -- if I were a State official and I was trying to decide whether my State should establish an Exchange, and I wanted to know whether individuals who enrolled in a plan on my possible State-established Exchange would get a credit, where would I look? Isn't the question before us as to standing whether the district court correctly held in the motion to dismiss context that there was standing? That may not be the end of the matter, but don't we have to -- isn't that what's before us? Well, what are you suggesting? Should we have a -- should we have a trial here? -- on this issue and find what the facts are? But, General Verrilli, before we get too immersed in a number of provisions of this, could you respond to a question that was asked during Mr. Carvin's argument. If we adopt Petitioners' interpretation of this Act, is it unconstitutionally coercive? Well, Mr. -- General Verrilli, let me ask you this about notice. We get lots and lots of amicus briefs from States. And we got two amicus briefs from States here; 34 states I think is -- that's the number of States that declined to or failed to establish a State Exchange? Now, if they were all caught off guard and they were upset about this, you would expect them to file an amicus brief telling us that. But actually, of the 34, only 6 of them signed the brief that was submitted by a number of States making that argument. 23 States, 23 jurisdictions submitted that brief; 17 of them are States that established State exchanges. Only 6 of the States that didn't establish State exchanges signed that brief, how do you account for that? Well, there's another point on notice on this Pennhurst argument that seems curious to me. Usually when this argument comes up, a State has signed up for a Federal program and then they say, oh, my gosh, we didn't realize what we had gotten ourselves into. But here, it's not too late for a State to establish an exchange if we were to adopt Petitioners' interpretation of the statute. So going forward, there would be no harm. Well, I said -- I've said going forward. After -- after the current tax year. Would it not be possible if we were to adopt Petitioners' interpretation of the statute to stay the mandate until the end of this tax year as we have done in other cases where we have adopted an interpretation of the constitutional -- or a statute that would have very disruptive consequences such as the Northern Pipeline case. Well, the puzzle that's created by -- by your interpretation is this: If Congress did not want the phrase ""established by the State"" to mean what that would normally be taken to mean, why did they use that language? Why didn't they use other formulations that appear elsewhere in the Act? Why didn't they say, ""established under the Act""? Why didn't they say, ""established within the State""? Why didn't they include a provision saying that an Exchange established by HHS is a State Exchange when they have a provision in there that does exactly that for the District of Columbia and for the territories? It says that they are deemed to be States for purposes of this Act. So why would they do that? Well, before you -- before you get on to that, that -- your answer doesn't explain why -- why ""by the State"" is in there. Then why didn't they say ""established under 1311""? Well, why didn't they say ""in the State""? That's the phrase you just used, ""in the State."" Why didn't they say ""in the State""? So when the statute says, ""each State shall establish,"" it really means the Federal government shall establish if a State doesn't establish. And if that were the correct interpretation, you wouldn't 1321 at all. Would you agree that there -- that there are provisions of the Act where the exact same phrase, ""established by the State,"" has to be read to mean established by the State and not by HHS? There are some provisions like that. All right. Well, let's take one -- let's take one. I'd be interested in your answer to it. 42 U.S.C. Section 1396w-3(h)(1)(D) which says that each State shall establish procedures to ensure that an Exchange established by the State utilizes a secure electronic interface. And they say that if that is read to -- if ""Exchange established by the State"" there is read to mean an HHS Exchange, that means that the State in which that Exchange is established is responsible for making sure that the Federal Exchange has a secure electronic interface. And the State -- As I understand your answer to be that there are Federal regulations telling the States what they have to do here, and they've all done it. But the fact remains that the State has some obligation under the regulations to make sure that there is a proper interface with the Federal Exchange. What is the provision that says that only a -- only a qualified individual can be -- can enroll in a plan under an Exchange? Qualified health plan. But what's the provision you were referring to when you said that an Exchange may enroll only a qualified individual? I understand your argument is that it's a -- it's a logical inference from a number of provisions that only a qualified individual may purchase the policy, but I gather there is no provision that you can point to that says that directly. ""Qualified"" is used in the -- in the lay sense of the term, it's not a technical term here. If there are any -- if there are any tax attorneys in the -- in the courtroom today, I think probably they wrote down what you just said. When we get future tax cases, the United States is going to argue that we should not read them to -- you know, there should be no presumption that a tax credit is provided by that statute. ",well mr carvin if i have those clerk i have the same clerk laughter and amanda write the memo and i receive it and i say this be a great memo who write it would the answer be it be write by will because amanda step into will s shoe mr carvin if i we be a if i we be a state official and i be try to decide whether my state should establish an exchange and i want to know whether individual who

exchange when they have a provision in there that do exactly that for the district of columbia and for the territory it say that they be deem to be state for purpose of this act so why would they do that well before you before you get on to that that your answer do not explain why why by the state be in there then why do not they say establish under well why do not they say in the state that be the phrase you just use in the state why do not they say in the state so when the statute say each state shall establish it really mean the federal government shall establish if a state do not establish and if that we be the correct interpretation you would not at all would you agree that there that there be provision of the act where the exact same phrase establish by the state have to be

2014,Mellouli v. Lynch,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Can we begin by looking at the text of the statute? What does the phrase “ relating to a controlled substance ”, et cetera, modify? Well, let's say we were let's say we're back in high school and we have to diagram this sentence. We could start out that way, and maybe we'll get beyond it, but let's start out that way. We have a phrase here, “ relating to a controlled substance ”. What does it modify? It has to modify a noun. What noun does it modify? If it modifies “ law ”, then I think you've lost the case. Well, that was my question. Well, that -- that might be sensible, but I -- I really do need to start with the text of the statute and understand what you make of the text of the statute. So if “ relating to ” modifies “ law ”, do you deny that the law -- that the -- the Kansas law in question here relates to a controlled substance? Or do you read relating to a controlled substance to mean relating solely to controlled substances as defined by Federal law? But the law -- the law relates to what it relates to. It doesn't relates to. It doesn't relate to something at one time and something at another time. What does the law relate to? The law relates to a long list of drugs. The great majority of them are on the Federal list. A few of them are not on the Federal list. Now, if it said relating solely to drugs on the Federal list, you'd have an argument. I just need to know what you want us to do with the text of the -- of the statute. It certainly is possible for “ relating to ” to modify “ violation ”. It's an awkward way of phrasing it, but that is possible. It's a noun. It could modify that. So what would the violation be? Is the -- the violation then is not -- the violation, I take it, then, would be the alien's conduct, what the alien did. Is that right? So what then happens if the alien's conduct relates to a Federally controlled substance, but the conviction is under a law that does not relate to a Federally controlled substance? What if the alien, for example, is convicted of burglarizing a house for the purpose of stealing drugs that are in the house? The law doesn't relate to a controlled substance, but the conduct does relate to a controlled substance. What if the -- what if someone was convicted of possession of a pipe that is very well designed to smoke crack, but maybe conceivably could be used to smoke a little bit of tobacco. So it -- maybe it's lawfully sold in some places because it could have a legitimate use. What would -- what would happen then? He's convicted of possessing a crack pipe. It's necessary to show that -- that there was crack in the pipe? Well, in your view, in order to make -- in order to make this count as a -- as a deportable offense, it would be necessary to show that there actually was crack in the pipe or that he actually used the pipe to smoke crack. Well, crack is a Federally controlled substance. So I didn't understand the answer to your question. Would -- would it be -- would the crack pipe itself be enough or do you have to show actual crack? When you say “ categorical approach ”, you mean the modified categorical approach, do you not? In -- in a jurisdiction like Kansas or in any foreign jurisdiction that has a list of controlled substances that is a little bit broader than the Federal list, lists at least one or two that are broader than the Federal list, the pure categorical approach would never result in -- in removal; am I right? In a removable offense. How would it? You'd say -- the person was convicted of selling a drug that is categorized, that is on a list or part of a list, that would be the element of the offense. So you would have to look beyond that to see which particular drug. That's the modified approach, is it not? Under your definition -- under your understanding of this, what practical work is done by the phrase as defined in Section 802 of Title XXI? You said a couple of minutes ago, and I had assumed this to be true, that under the laws of all the States, the great majority of controlled substances are on the Federal list, and there -- in some instances -- are a few additional ones and you said that all of those laws would be covered. If that's the case, then I don't see what was achieved by putting the reference to the Federal list in the statute. They might have just said relating to a controlled substance. Do we -- do we even know that this is a -- a proper conviction under Kansas law, that the Kansas statute actually means what it's been interpreted here to mean? The Petitioner pled guilty to this, I think, because he got a break, because he could have been charged with something -- if, in fact, he had Adderall, which is a Federally controlled substance -- he could have been charged with something more serious. So he pled to this misdemeanor. But it's really hard to believe that the Kansas statute actually regards as drug paraphernalia anything that is used at any time to contain a controlled substance. Suppose somebody buys marijuana or some other drug and it's in a plastic bag. So the plastic bag is -- that's one violation. The person puts it in a pocket; that's another violation. The pocket is -- is drug paraphernalia. Takes it out of the pocket and puts it in the glove compartment of a car; that's a third violation. The car is equipment that's used to store it. Takes it out of that, puts it in something -- it -- it can't really mean this, but we don't have State court interpretations. ",can we begin by look at the text of the statute what do the phrase relating to a control substance et cetera modify well let us say we we be let us say we be back in high school and we have to diagram this sentence we could start out that way and maybe we will get beyond it but let us start out that way we have a phrase here relate to a control substance what do it modify it have to modify a noun what noun do it modify if it modify law then i think you have lose the case well that be my question well that that might be sensible but i i really do need to start with the text of the statute and understand what you make of the text of the statute so if relate to modifies law do you deny that the law that the the kansa law in question here relate to a control substance or do you read relate to a control substance to mean relate solely to control substance as define by federal law but the law the law relate to what it relate to it do not relate to it do not relate to something at one time and something at another time what do the law relate to the law relate to a long list of drug the great majority of them be on the federal list a few of them be not on the federal list now if it say relate solely to drug on the federal list you would have an argument i just need to know what you want us to do with the text of the of the statute it certainly be possible for relate to to modify violation it be an awkward way of phrase it but that be possible it be a noun it could modify that so what would the violation be be the the violation then be not the violation i take it then would be the alien s conduct what the alien do be that right so what then happen if the alien s conduct relate to a federally control substance but the conviction be under a law that do not relate to a federally control substance what if the alien for example be convict of burglarize a house for the purpose of steal drug that be in the house the law do not relate to a control substance but the conduct do relate to a control substance what if the what if someone be convict of possession of a pipe that be very well design to smoke crack but maybe conceivably could be use to smoke a little bit of tobacco so it maybe it be lawfully sell in some place because it could have a legitimate use what would what would happen then he be convict of possess a crack pipe it be necessary to show that that there be crack in the pipe well in your view in order to make in order to make this count as a as a deportable offense it would be necessary to show that there actually be crack in the pipe or that he actually use the pipe to smoke crack well crack be a federally control substance so i do not understand the answer to your question would would it be would the crack pipe itself be enough or do you have to show actual crack when you say categorical approach you mean the modified categorical approach do you not in in a jurisdiction like kansa or in any foreign jurisdiction that have a list of controlled substance that be a little bit broad than the federal list list at least one or two that be broad than the federal list the pure categorical approach would never result in in removal be i right in a removable offense how would it you would say the person be convict of sell a drug that be categorize that be on a list or part of a list that would be the element of the offense so you would have to look beyond that to see which particular drug that be the modified approach be it not under your definition under your understanding of this what practical work be do by the phrase as define in section of title xxi you say a couple of minute ago and i have assume this to be true that under the law of all the state the great majority of controlled substance be on the federal list and there in some instance be a few additional one and you say that all of those law would be cover if that be the case then i do not see what be achieve by put the reference to the federal list in the statute they might have just say relate to a control substance do we do we even know that this be a a proper conviction under kansa law that the kansa statute actually mean what it be be interpret here to mean the petitioner plead guilty to this i think because he get a break because he could have be charge with something if in fact he have adderall which be a federally control substance he could have be charge with something more serious so he plead to this misdemeanor but it be really hard to believe that the kansa statute actually regard as drug paraphernalia anything that be use at any time to contain a controlled substance suppose somebody buy marijuana or some other drug and it be in a plastic bag so the plastic bag be that be one violation the person put it in a pocket that be another violation the pocket be be drug paraphernalia take it out of the pocket and put it in the glove compartment of a car that be a third violation the car be equipment that be use to store it take it out of that put it in something it it can not really mean this but we do not have state court interpretation ,328.2700000000001,Roberts Court,"Jan 14, 2015",Moones Mellouli,"Loretta Lynch,

2015,Nichols v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Under -- Yeah. You have a textual argument that I -- that I understand, but one of the arguments you mentioned at the outset was that an examination of the legislative history shows that Congress intended to produce the sort of result that was produced here, and I wonder if that's really a plausible argument. If you're correct, then two things happen; at least two things happen. One, Kansas retains on its record an inaccurate -- inaccurate information about the presence of a sex offender, which can have a lot of adverse consequences for a lot of people. I don't see why Congress would have wanted that to remain. And do you really think Congress was unconcerned about the United States exporting pedophiles to the Philippines or to other countries? Do you think that -- that they were not concerned about not only the human rights implications of that, but our relations with other countries? Well, if I could then come back to Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical of someone like your client who moves from Kansas to Illinois, what, in the language of the statute, would prevent that person from going to the registry office in Kansas before departing and reporting there that he was moving to Illinois and his new address in Illinois would be whatever it would be? Why does that not fit under this -- under the language of the statute? Or would you agree that it does? Well, if you -- if you agree to that, then I don't see why -- why there is a difference between that situation and the situation where the -- the person leaves Kansas and goes to the Philippines. Why would it not be -- Why would it not be sufficient under 42 U.S.C. 16913(c)? Well, it says, ""shall not, later than three business days after each change of residence, appear in person in at least one jurisdiction involved pursuant to subsection (a) and inform that jurisdiction of the change of address."" So prior to leaving, he is within the period of not later than what -- than three business days after the change of residence. And at that time when he goes to the registry office in Kansas, he is residing in Kansas. So he falls within subsection (a). In terms of -- In terms of Federal policy, hasn't Congress, by the enactment of the new statute and in other ways, evidenced a belief that the United States should not be exporting its pedophile problems to other countries? And countries like the Philippines where the -- the Petitioner here went are known places that are attractive to sex tourists who go there to abuse young children and -- hasn't Congress evidenced a concern about this both for the human rights aspects of the problem and, also, I would think, for relations with the government of the Philippines?

2015,Green v. Brennan,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","May I follow up on Justice Kagan's question? You were discussing the possibility of deciding this case based on the particular language of the regulation that applies here, but your question presented is phrased much more broadly. You say under Federal employment discrimination law, so I took that to mean that the rule that you're advocating would be the same for public and private sector employment. But there is -- this matter alleged to be discriminatory applies only to Federal employment. Isn't it true that outside of the area of constructive discharge -- and maybe constructive discharge is different, and I think that's really the thrust of your argument. But outside of that situation there must be an act of intentional discrimination within the limitations period. Yeah, but you're arguing that there's -- because there's this imputation, it's different for constructive discharge. But my -- my question is outside of that context, under Evans and Ricks and Morgan and Ledbetter, there must be an act of intentional discrimination within the limitations period. Why don't you change -- why don't you just amend the regulation? We're interpreting the language -- it's not even a statute. It's a regulation. It's your regulation. Why don't you just amend it to make it clear? You think this is a sensible rule, it is very clear rule. And it's probably a sensible rule when you've got a 45-day period. Why don't you just change the regulation? Why -- -- this elaborate litigation. Well, suppose he showed up in -- in Wyoming? What would you have done? Wouldn't you have allowed him to take that job at the lower pay? No. No. You said -- Suppose there was evidence that the employer had a continuing intent to force Mr. Green's resignation. So you've got emails that say, Mr. Green is causing trouble for us by charging us with discrimination, we're going to do A, B, C, D and E to force him to retire. And then on the day when he quits there is another email that says, Hallelujah, we've achieved our objective, he's retired. Now when would it run in that situation? Let me clarify it. So nothing more is done. There are all these acts up to a certain point, and then 45 days, 50 days pass and the employee resigns, but the employer has all along had the intention of forcing the resignation. So on the date of the resignation the employer intends to cause a discharge for discriminatory reason.

2015,Simmons v. Himmelreich,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","You would have a nice, clean textual argument if you were willing to argue that ""judgment"" means ""judgment""; it means any judgment. But in your reply brief, you say that perhaps a technical or a procedural judgment is not a judgment under the judgment bar provision. So what does that mean? What is a technical or procedural judgment? Why wouldn't a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction be a procedural judgment? But what -- Go ahead. Wouldn't they apply anyway? Do you need a provision? Specifically saying that they would apply? It can't be read in a strictly literal sense because then 2680 itself wouldn't apply. All right. That's one way that we're out of a purely literal reading of this. Smith -- Smith could be explained on the absurdity rule, could it not? Well, the whole point of the Westfall Act was to allow substitution, so if that didn't apply, then there wouldn't be substitution and there would be no point in having the Westfall Act. Correct? To go back to the point you were making before, under your interpretation, does the judgment bar add anything to principles of claim preclusion? It was in existence in 1946, but today would -- it would be superfluous. So you want us to decide this case based on a literal reading of 2680. But the Sixth Circuit did not decide the case on that ground, and we don't have to address that, do we? So why should we not decide whether the Sixth Circuit was correct in its reasoning and apply the same literal reading approach that you recommend to -- with respect to 2680 to the judgment bar, and hold that a judgment is a judgment, and not necessarily a judgment on the merits? And then -- because the issue under 2680 is, as I think the argument has shown, is very complicated. It's a separate -- it's -- it's another ground for affirmance, correct? It's an alternative grounds for affirmance, which we have discretion to decide whether we want to reach or not. ",you would have a nice clean textual argument if you we be willing to argue that judgment mean judgment it mean any judgment but in your reply brief you say that perhaps a technical or a procedural judgment be not a judgment under the judgment bar provision so what do that mean what be a technical or procedural judgment why would not a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction be a procedural judgment but what go ahead would not they apply anyway do you need a provision specifically say that they would apply it can not be read in a strictly literal sense because then itself would not apply all right that be one way that we be out of a purely literal reading of this smith smith could be explain on the absurdity rule could it not well the whole point of the westfall act be to allow substitution so if that do not apply then there would not be substitution and there would be no point in have the westfall act correct to go back to the point you we be make before under your interpretation do the judgment bar add anything to principle of claim preclusion it be in existence in but today would it would be superfluous so you want us to decide this case base on a literal reading of but the sixth circuit do not decide the case on that ground and we do not have to address that do we so why should we not decide whether the sixth circuit be correct in its reasoning and apply the same literal reading approach that you recommend to with respect to to the judgment bar and hold that a judgment be a judgment and not necessarily a judgment on the merit and then because the issue under be as i think the argument have show be very complicate it be a separate it be it be another ground for affirmance correct it be an alternative ground for affirmance which we have discretion to decide whether we want to reach or not ,126.09,Roberts Court,"Mar 22, 2016",Jermaine Simmons et al.,Walter J.

2015,Harris v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Would you say it's correct that compliance with the Voting Rights Act, the desire to obtain preclearance, is at least like other traditional districting considerations, like respecting county lines, respecting municipal lines, having contiguous districts? Would you agree with that? So if -- if that is the case, then is this what you were asking us to say with respect to the Voting Rights Act, that the things that were really necessary to obtain preclearance are legitimate, but you can't go -- but they went further. They -- they went beyond what was really necessary to obtain preclearance, so we would have to determine whether that was true or not, or some court would have to determine whether that was true or not. Well, what if the only way that you -- that a State could obtain preclearance when Section 5 was still in force was to under-populate some districts? Would that be permissible? Just as you might have a situation where the only way in which you could respect municipal lines or county lines was to under-populate some districts to some degree. Well, the district court found -- and this is on 79a of the Appendix to the Jurisdictional Statement -- ""partisanship played some role."" So do you want us to interpret that to mean that if there was no partisanship, everything would have come out exactly the same way? It had no affect whatsoever on the districting? Well, that's a -- that's a red herring. We don't need to discuss the issue of parity. If you have a system of proportional representation and you get 55 percent of the vote, you'll get 55 percent of the -- of the representatives. But in the kind of electoral system we have in the United States, with single-member districts and winner-take-all, a neutral -- a neutral districting plan will never produce exactly the same breakdown of legislators as the breakdown of the votes in the election. But that's -- I mean, that's a side issue. What do we do with this statement: Partisanship played some role? This is what -- this is what interests me about the case. If we assume, as the district court did, that partisanship is not a legitimate consideration, and it's not, like, respecting county lines, and if we interpret the district court's opinion as finding that partisanship was part of the reason for the plan that was adopted, then is the test, the Mt. Healthy test -- which in my understanding is what we normally apply in a constitutional mixed motive situation. So that if an illegitimate, unconstitutional consideration is one of the reasons, the burden shifts to the defendant to show that things would have come out the same way, even if that factor had not been in the case, or is it what the court said in Bush v. Vera and a few other cases, that in this particular context, that's not the test? The test is whether the illegitimate factor there, race, was the predominant consideration. It seems to me it -- it turns on the choice between the two. Is that a wrong? Well, what if there were? What if there were a case where the -- the commissioner or whoever was responsible for producing the plan produced -- chose between two plans. Plan A has a deviation of .1 percent; Plan B has a deviation of 9.9 percent. And they write a report, and they say, well, we -- it came down to these two plans, and we chose B, because we want to maximize the representation in the legislature of Republicans or Democrats. And you would say that that would be constitutional? No, it's not this case, but it -- Well, let -- let's assume that the -- the opinion of the district court found that partisanship was a consideration. So are you saying that that finding can't be sustained because it wasn't based on sufficient evidence brought forward by the plaintiffs? Well, was it a factor or not? Was partisanship just irrelevant, that it played no role, everything would have come out the same way -- -- without partisanship according the district court's finding? The district of -- Well, I'm really surprised with the way you -- the way you read the district court's opinion. In footnote 10 of the district court's opinion, they set out the standard that they apply. It's on 62 -- I'm sorry -- 63a, running over into 64a. And in the -- the final paragraph that begins at the bottom of the page, ""For decision purposes, a majority of the panel made up of Judge Clifton and Judge Silver have concluded that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that partisanship predominanted over legitimate redistricting considerations."" Doesn't that mean that they found that there were some illegitimate considerations, or at least they -- and they assumed that partisanship was an illegitimate consideration? No, no. I'm sorry. Just to clarify your answer. So you think that what they said in footnote 10 only applies to one district. ",would you say it be correct that compliance with the voting right act the desire to obtain preclearance be at least like other traditional districting consideration like respect county line respect municipal line have contiguous district would you agree with that so if if that be the case then be this what you we be ask us to say with respect to the voting right act that the thing that we be really necessary to obtain preclearance be legitimate but you can not go but they go far they they go beyond what be really necessary to obtain preclearance so we would have to determine whether that be true or not or some court would have to determine whether that be true or not well what if the only way that you that a state could obtain preclearance when section be still in force be to under populate some district would that be permissible just as you might have a situation where the only way in which you could respect municipal line or county line be to under populate some district to some degree well the district court find and this be on a of the appendix to the jurisdictional statement partisanship play some role so do you want us to interpret that to mean that if there be no partisanship everything would have come out exactly the same way it have no affect whatsoever on the districting well that be a that be a red herring we do not need to discuss the issue of parity if you have a system of proportional representation and you get percent of the vote you will get percent of the of the representative but in the kind of electoral system we have in the united state with single member district and winner take all a neutral a neutral districting plan will never produce exactly the same breakdown of legislator as the breakdown of the vote in the election but that be i mean that be a side issue what do we do with this statement partisanship play some role this be what this be what interest me about the case if we assume as the district court do that partisanship be not a legitimate consideration and it be not like respect county line and if we interpret the district court s opinion as find that partisanship be part of the reason for the plan that be adopt then be the test the mt healthy test which in my understanding be what we normally apply in a constitutional mixed motive situation so that if an illegitimate unconstitutional consideration be one of the reason the burden shift to the defendant to show that thing would have come out the same way even if that factor have not be in the case or be it what the court say in bush v vera and a few other case that in this particular context that be not the test the test be whether the illegitimate factor there race be the predominant consideration it seem to me it it turn on the choice between the two be that a wrong well what if there we be what if there we be a case where the the commissioner or whoever be responsible for produce the plan produce chose between two plan plan a have a deviation of percent plan b have a deviation of percent and they write a report and they say well we it come down to these two plan and we choose b because we want to maximize the representation in the legislature of republican or democrat and you would say that that would be constitutional no it be not this case but it well let let us assume that the the opinion of the district court find that partisanship be a consideration so be you say that that finding can not be sustain because it be not base on sufficient evidence bring forward by the plaintiff well be it a factor or not be partisanship just irrelevant that it play no role everything would have come out the same way without partisanship accord the district court s finding the district of well I be really surprised with the way you the way you read the district court s opinion in footnote of the district court s opinion they set out the standard that they apply it be on I be sorry a run over into a and in the the final paragraph that begin at the bottom of the page for decision purpose a majority of the panel make up of judge clifton and judge silver have conclude that plaintiff have not demonstrate that partisanship predominanted over legitimate redistricting consideration do not that mean that they find that there we be some illegitimate consideration or at least they and they assume that partisanship be an illegitimate consideration no no I be sorry just to clarify your answer so you think that what they say in footnote only applies to one district ,309.63000000000005,Roberts Court,"Dec 8, 2015","Wesley Harris, et al.","Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission, et al.",14-232,"Jun 30, 2015","Apr 20, 2016",112,0.0,1.0,1.0,0

2015,Musacchio v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Could I ask you -- I'm sorry. You wanted to finish that. It doesn't seem clear to me that these two theories are actually separate. They -- they -- when Congress enacts a criminal statute, it often adds a lot of synonyms. So, you know, in the -- in a theft statute, whoever embezzles, steals, or unlawfully and willfully extracts or converts, et cetera, they're not necessarily all distinct. And I don't really see a difference between making unauthorized access and exceeding authorized access. Let's take the first, making unauthorized access. Let's say somebody has access to some -- an employee here in the building has access to -- lawful access, proper access to some records. If that employee at night sneaks into some other place in the building and starts looking through files, that person is making unauthorized access. And in the other situation, exceeding authorized access, let's say a person doesn't have any -- any access to any files in the court, but sneaks in and looks at those files. That person had zero authorized access and, therefore, exceeded authorized access. I just think these are -- it seems to me, reading them, they're two ways of saying the same thing. So the issue that's presented here may not -- the issue that you've asked us to decide may not actually be presented by the facts of this case. Suppose that there's a -- that there's a two-count indictment and there's plenty of evidence to convict on Count I and zero evidence, not one scintilla of evidence, on Count II, and the jury convicts on both counts; so the -- defendant is entitled to a judgment of acquittal on Count II. But you seem to be saying in that situation, the court would say, this is a crazy jury. This is an irrational jury because their verdict on Count II is totally ridiculous; and therefore, the defendant is entitled to judgment of acquittal on Count I as well, despite the fact that there's plenty of evidence on Count I. Is that what you're saying? Well, what's different -- what's the difference between that and the argument you just made? That -- that would be a revolutionary holding. But, now, I don't see a difference, other than a purely formal difference, between that situation and what you're -- what you're arguing. Well, why was the instruction erroneous? You concede that these two methods of violating the statute are discrete? They're not just different ways of describing the same thing? Well, suppose you had an indictment charging someone with exceeding authorized access and there was a factual dispute about, let's say, the date on which the employee's employment ended, so therefore, the date on which any authorized access that the employee had to records of the employer ended, you would say that, if you did not succeed in proving beyond a reasonable doubt that, as of the date when the access was obtained, the employee had ceased to be employed, that that employee would be entitled to a judgment of acquittal? That seems rather odd. Well, couldn't there not be -- Why shouldn't the rule in this context be the same as the rule for timely filing a Federal habeas petition? You think that the State's interest in the habeas context in finality and comity is stronger than the defendant's interest in a direct criminal appeal in requiring that the charge be filed on time where what's at stake is -- is a criminal conviction? But -- but just take a situation where, under the habeas rule, it would be proper for the -- the district court to raise the statute-of-limitations defense on its own motion. Why would that not fit within the plain-error rule? Suppose the court of appeals in -- in a direct appeal sees that the statute of limitations for a particular offense is six years and the indictment was filed 25 years after the event. Can the court of appeals say to the government, look at this. It looks like it's too late. Do you have any explanation for this? And the government says, well, no, doesn't -- we can't think of anything. Do you have to wait until habeas to correct that? ",could i ask you I be sorry you want to finish that it do not seem clear to me that these two theory be actually separate they they when congress enact a criminal statute it often add a lot of synonym so you know in the in a theft statute whoever embezzle steal or unlawfully and willfully extract or convert et cetera they be not necessarily all distinct and i do not really see a difference between make unauthorized access and exceed authorized access let us take the first make unauthorized access let us say somebody have access to some an employee here in the building have access to lawful access proper access to some record if that employee at night sneak into some other place in the building and start look through file that person be make unauthorized access and in the other situation exceed authorized access let us say a person do not have any any access to any file in the court but sneak in and look at those file that person have zero authorized access and therefore exceed authorized access i just think these be it seem to me read them they be two way of say the same thing so the issue that be present here may not the issue that you have ask us to decide may not actually be present by the fact of this case suppose that there be a that there be a two count indictment and there be plenty of evidence to convict on count i and zero evidence not one scintilla of evidence on count ii and the jury convict on both count so the defendant be entitle to a judgment of acquittal on count ii but you seem to be say in that situation the court would say this be a crazy jury this be an irrational jury because their verdict on count ii be totally ridiculous and therefore the defendant be entitle to judgment of acquittal on count i as well despite the fact that there be plenty of evidence on count i be that what you be say well what be different what be the difference between that and the argument you just make that that would be a revolutionary holding but now i do not see a difference other than a purely formal difference between that situation and what you be what you be argue well why be the instruction erroneous you concede that these two method of violate the statute be discrete they be not just different way of describe the same thing well suppose you have an indictment charge someone with exceed authorized access and there be a factual dispute about let us say the date on which the employee s employment end so therefore the date on which any authorized access that the employee have to record of the employer end you would say that if you do not succeed in prove beyond a reasonable doubt that as of the date when the access be obtain the employee have cease to be employ that that employee would be entitle to a judgment of acquittal that seem rather odd well could not there not be why should not the rule in this context be the same as the rule for timely file a federal habeas petition you think that the state s interest in the habeas context in finality and comity be strong than the defendant s interest in a direct criminal appeal in require that the charge be file on time where what be at stake be be a criminal conviction but but just take a situation where under the habeas rule it would be proper for the the district court to raise the statute of limitation defense on its own motion why would that not fit within the plain error rule suppose the court of appeal in in a direct appeal see that the statute of limitation for a particular offense be six year and the indictment be file year after the event can the court of appeal say to the government look at this it look like it be too late do you have any explanation for this and the government say well no do not we can not think of anything do you have to wait until habeas to correct that ,270.94000000000005,Roberts Court,"Nov 30, 2015",Michael Musacchio,United States,14-1095,"Jun 29, 2015","Jan 25, 2016",112,0.0,1.0,0.0,0
2015,Utah v. Strieff,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","You're not talking about the statistics, Mr. Bash. Could you do that? And then does the United States know the percentage of residents of the United States who have outstanding warrants? Yeah. And what -- what should we be concerned about there? What -- what would prevent the problem in -- in communities like that? Well, would that be true if, let's say, one-half of 1 percent of the residents of South Salt Lake or Salt Lake City have outstanding warrants? Well, that's true, there's a downside. If the officer makes an illegal stop, the officer exposes himself or herself to all sorts of consequences. But you're saying that, let's -- if the -- on the statistic that I gave you, if there's a 1 in 200 chance that there's going to be an outstanding warrant, so the officer says well, you know, I don't have -- I have no reason to stop this person, but if I stop 200 people today illegally, then I'm going to find one who has an outstanding warrant, you would say that that -- that gives the officer the incentive to make those 199 illegal stops. As I understand your position, you don't argue that the arrest was unlawful; is that right? So the arrest was lawful. And when the officer is making the arrest, it's permissible for safety purposes for the officer to frisk the person who is being arrested. Do you agree with that? So it's a -- so it's a lawful search, correct. Isn't it -- can you -- can you give me one other example of a situation in which this Court has held that the fruit of a lawful search must be suppressed? Well, in any circumstance. I'm just pointing it out that that's a curiosity, isn't it, to have a law -- to suppress the fruit of a lawful search? And maybe you need strong circumstances to justify such an unusual and unprecedented result. Well, if the individual is going to be arrested and put in jail, isn't it standard procedure and lawful procedure for the authorities to search that person thoroughly? They couldn't have a person bring drugs into -- into the jail or things that the person might use to hurt himself or other people? So it would -- well, what does that mean? It's -- but it's not -- it -- that doesn't -- that's lawful conduct on their part, right? Okay. But -- so you're asking for the suppression of the fruit of a lawful search. Well, we really don't know very much about exactly what happened here, which is unfortunate. But what the officer testified was that he didn't just grab this guy and say give me an ID and then -- and then run a warrants check. He did say that he -- he approached him and he said -- identified himself. He said he thought there might be drug activity going on in the house, and he asked him to tell -- he said, ""I asked him to tell me what he was doing there."" Now, we don't even know what he -- unless I'm -- it's someplace else in this record, we don't even know what your client said. But he could have said, what am I doing there, yeah, I live there, or, my mother lives there, or, my best friend lives there. But whatever -- we don't know what he said. But then at some later point he ran a warrants check. So how can we infer from that, that the whole point of the stop was to run the warrants check? You agree that attenuation is based on -- on deterrence; that the attenuation determination is based on a calculation of the deterrent effect of the ruling. And -- and your deterrence argument doesn't depend at all on statistics? So if one in a thousand people has an outstanding warrant, that's enough? That statistic would -- that statistic wouldn't upset your argument? One -- one in 10,000, would that upset your argument? I've got to get to a number where you're going to say -- Do you think the judges in the traffic -- in the traffic courts are going to start issuing lots of warrants because they want to provide a basis for -- for randomly stopping people? ",you be not talk about the statistic mr bash could you do that and then do the united state know the percentage of resident of the united state who have outstanding warrant yeah and what what should we be concern about there what what would prevent the problem in in community like that well would that be true if let us say one half of percent of the resident of south salt lake or salt lake city have outstanding warrant well that be true there be a downside if the officer make an illegal stop the officer expose himself or herself to all sort of consequence but you be say that let us if the on the statistic that i give you if there be a in chance that there be go to be an outstanding warrant so the officer say well you know i do not have i have no reason to stop this person but if i stop people today illegally then I be go to find one who have an outstanding warrant you would say that that that give the officer the incentive to make those illegal stop as i understand your position you do not argue that the arrest be unlawful be that right so the arrest be lawful and when the officer be make the arrest it be permissible for safety purpose for the officer to frisk the person who be be arrest do you agree with that so it be a so it be a lawful search correct be not it can you can you give me one other example of a situation in which this court have hold that the fruit of a lawful search must be suppress well in any circumstance I be just point it out that that be a curiosity be not it to have a law to suppress the fruit of a lawful search and maybe you need strong circumstance to justify such an unusual and unprecedented result well if the individual be go to be arrest and put in jail be not it standard procedure and lawful procedure for the authority to search that person thoroughly they could not have a person bring drug into into the jail or thing that the person might use to hurt himself or other people so it would well what do that mean it be but it be not it that do not that be lawful conduct on their part right okay but so you be ask for the suppression of the fruit of a lawful search well we really do not know very much about exactly what happen here which be unfortunate but what the officer testify be that he do not just grab this guy and say give me an id and then and then run a warrant check he do say that he he approach him and he say identify himself he say he think there might be drug activity go on in the house and he ask him to tell he say i ask him to tell me what he be do there now we do not even know what he unless I be it be someplace else in this record we do not even know what your client say but he could have say what be i do there yeah i live there or my mother live there or my best friend live there but whatever we do not know what he say but then at some late point he run a warrant check so how can we infer from that that the whole point of the stop be to run the warrant check you agree that attenuation be base on on deterrence that the attenuation determination be base on a calculation of the deterrent effect of the ruling and and your deterrence argument do not depend at all on statistic so if one in a thousand people have an outstanding warrant that be enough that statistic would that statistic would not upset your argument one one in would that upset your argument I have get to get to a number where you be go to say do you think the judge in the traffic in the traffic court be go to start issue lot of warrant because they want to provide a basis for for randomly stop people ,252.82,Roberts Court,"Feb 22, 2016",Utah,Edward Joseph Strieff,14-1373,"Oct 1, 2015","Jun 20, 2016",112,1.0,1.0,0.0,1
2015,Wittman v. Personhuballah,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","I'm sorry. Go ahead. There are two questions. There's the question injury-in-fact, which you've been talking about. Now, on the issue of legally cognizable interest, does a member of Congress who wants to be re-elected have a legally cognizable interest in running in a district that was lawfully enacted by the State legislature? Could I ask a question, which is really highlighted by Justice Kagan's hypothetical? Because normally, were -- were it not for the Voting Rights Act, there would be a very simple answer to all of these questions, and that is that you cannot take race into account at all. It's invidious discrimination to take governmental action on the basis of race. Does Shelby County have any relevance to this case? Is this the type of case that will never come up again in the future if the Voting Rights Act is not amended? Did anything else happen between the time when your office took the prior position and -- (Laughter.) -- your appearance here today? No. I'm just asking you: Was there anything relevant that happened? Which expert are you talking about?

2015,Taylor v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","When Congress enacted the Hobbs Act, did it intend to exercise the full measure of its authority under the Commerce Clause? All right. Could Congress enact a statute under -- under Raich, based on the reasoning of Raich, prohibiting the theft of a controlled substance just as it has put -- enacted statutes prohibiting the growing of marijuana or the production of other controlled substances? Could it enact a statute that makes it a crime to steal a controlled substance, exercising its Commerce Clause authority under the reasoning of Raich? On a case-by-case basis, then, why can it prohibit the growing of marijuana across the board without proving anything about the particular marijuana in question, but according to you, it cannot prohibit the sale of -- I'm sorry, the theft of marijuana? Why is that needed -- why is that not needed in a situation in which the person is growing marijuana? For personal use? I don't think there's any question that this is a jurisdictional element and the jurisdictional element has to be proven. That's not the issue. The issue is the meaning of the jurisdictional element. And if the jurisdictional element means, as interpreted in Raich, and it's a -- you know, it's a controversial area of constitutional law, but it's a precedent and you're not challenging it -- so the jurisdictional element as interpreted in that case is anything that has an effect on -- anything -- any purely -- any local activity that is of a type which, if taken in the aggregate, would have a substantial effect on interstate commerce, that falls within the Commerce Clause. If the jury is instructed in that way, and that's basically the way I think it was instructed here, all they have to find is that there was a theft of -- there was a robbery of drugs, and it had some effect on the supply of drugs. Yeah, well, that's -- that's the -- that's what Raich -- that's the interpretation of the Commerce Clause. Do you want the jury to decide what the Commerce Clause means? It would be an interesting -- under those who -- who think that juries once upon a time had the authority to decide legal issues. Do you want them to decide whether the majority or the dissent was correct in -- in Gonzales? I asked Mr. Jones whether the Hobbs Act exercises the full measure of Congress's Commerce Clause, an authority which I thought a number of cases have said. Do you agree with that? Because then you do run into these limitation -- in the search for a limiting principle, which you seem to be addressing. So Congress could prohibit and has prohibited a person from possessing even a very small amount of marijuana, right, a single cigarette, a single marijuana cigarette? So if one person steals a marijuana cigarette from another person, robs that person of one marijuana cigarette, that's a violation of the Hobbs Act? It falls within the Commerce Clause, doesn't it? Suppose someone robbed the farmer in Wickard v. Filburn of the wheat that the farmer was growing for personal consumption. Would that be a violation of the Hobbs Act? ",when congress enact the hobbs act do it intend to exercise the full measure of its authority under the commerce clause all right could congress enact a statute under under raich base on the reasoning of raich prohibit the theft of a controlled substance just as it have put enact statute prohibit the grow of marijuana or the production of other control substance could it enact a statute that make it a crime to steal a controlled substance exercise its commerce clause authority under the reasoning of raich on a case by case basis then why can it prohibit the growing of marijuana across the board without prove anything about the particular marijuana in question but accord to you it can not prohibit the sale of I be sorry the theft of marijuana why be that need why be that not need in a situation in which the person be grow marijuana for personal use i do not think there be any question that this be a jurisdictional element and the jurisdictional element have to be prove that be not the issue the issue be the meaning of the jurisdictional element and if the jurisdictional element mean as interpret in raich and it be a you know it have a controversial area of constitutional law but it be a precedent and you be not challenge it so the jurisdictional element as interpret in that case be anything that have an effect on anything any purely any local activity that be of a type which if take in the aggregate would have a substantial effect on interstate commerce that fall within the commerce clause if the jury be instruct in that way and that be basically the way i think it be instruct here all they have to find be that there be a theft of there be a robbery of drug and it have some effect on the supply of drug yeah well that be that be the that be what raich that be the interpretation of the commerce clause do you want the jury to decide what the commerce clause mean it would be an interesting under those who who think that jury once upon a time have the authority to decide legal issue do you want them to decide whether the majority or the dissent be correct in in gonzales i ask mr jones whether the hobbs act exercise the full measure of congress s commerce clause an authority which i think a number of case have say do you agree with that because then you do run into these limitation in the search for a limiting principle which you seem to be address so congress could prohibit and have prohibit a person from possess even a very small amount of marijuana right a single cigarette a single marijuana cigarette so if one person steal a marijuana cigarette from another person robs that person of one marijuana cigarette that be a violation of the hobbs act it fall within the commerce clause do not it suppose someone rob the farmer in wickard v filburn of the wheat that the farmer be grow for personal consumption would that be a violation of the hobbs act ,213.29,Roberts Court,"Feb 23, 2016",David Anthony Taylor,United States,14-6166,"Oct 1, 2015","Jun 20, 2016",112,0.0,1.0,0.0,0
2015,Birchfield v. North Dakota,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","One way -- One way of looking at what the State is doing is not to criminalize the assertion of a constitutional right, but to criminalize reneging on a bargain. And the bargain was, we give you a license to drive, and in exchange for that, you consent to a -- to a blood-alcohol test under certain circumstances. And if you renege on that bargain, then that's what's criminalized. Why isn't that a better way of looking at this? You mean -- But we're interested in -- in other possibilities. And so if you assume that a State can condition the -- the right to -- the ability to drive on the State's roads -- and let's assume this is not somebody who is crossing the border. Assume a State can condition the -- the ability to drive on a State's roads on consenting to a blood-alcohol test, perhaps under certain circumstances. Let's say this is done in writing at the time when the person applies for the license, so it's not -- it's not just implied. Why does that -- what is different about that situation from a number of other situations that I can think of? For example, conditioning a -- a license to operate an interstate passenger train on submitting to a blood-alcohol test in the event of reasonable suspicion. The person is operating the -- the train under the influence of -- of alcohol, or the same thing with someone who is operating aircraft. Or suppose there were a law that said that if you want to enter certain government buildings, such as this building, the -- the condition of entering is consenting to a search, and you have to sign something, you have to go through the magnetometer. And then if a person got through that, and there was reasonable suspicion that the person had smuggled in some kind of a weapon, the person would be subjected to a search. What would be the difference between that situation and this situation? Suppose the Breathalyzer test was improved, there's better technology. So let's suppose that all that's required is to put the Breathalyzer a couple of inch -- an inch from the person's mouth and wait for the person to breathe, and that would be sufficient to measure blood-alcohol. That -- would you say that's a search? All right. So if you compare that with what -- what has to be done here, what is the big -- what is the big difference between those? That you have to put a straw in your mouth? It doesn't seem -- it doesn't seem realistic. The reason why people don't want to submit to a blood-alcohol test is that they don't want their blood-alcohol measured. It's not that they object so much to blowing into a straw. Do you disagree with that? Could you say something about what the practical consequences of requiring a warrant for every Breathalyzer would be in a State like North Dakota? I -- when -- my picture of North Dakota is that it's not like New York City. You don't have night court going on all the time. And so how many of these tests occur during some period of time, and how many magistrates would you have on duty, let's say, at two o'clock in the morning to field a request for a warrant? Do you know how many Breathalyzer tests or blood tests are administered during any period of time in North Dakota? 6,000 per year? Justice -- Justice Sotomayor is assuming that you're going to lose. So she wants to know what your reaction is to that. (Laughter.) ",one way one way of look at what the state be do be not to criminalize the assertion of a constitutional right but to criminalize renege on a bargain and the bargain be we give you a license to drive and in exchange for that you consent to a to a blood alcohol test under certain circumstance and if you renege on that bargain then that be what be criminalize why be not that a good way of look at this you mean but we be interested in in other possibility and so if you assume that a state can condition the the right to the ability to drive on the state s road and let us assume this be not somebody who be cross the border assume a state can condition the the ability to drive on a state s road on consent to a blood alcohol test perhaps under certain circumstance let us say this be do in writing at the time when the person applies for the license so it be not it be not just imply why do that what be different about that situation from a number of other situation that i can think of for example condition a a license to operate an interstate passenger train on submit to a blood alcohol test in the event of reasonable suspicion the person be operate the the train under the influence of of alcohol or the same thing with someone who be operate aircraft or suppose there we be a law that say that if you want to enter certain government building such as this building the the condition of enter be consent to a search and you have to sign something you have to go through the magnetometer and then if a person get through that and there be reasonable suspicion that the person have smuggle in some kind of a weapon the person would be subject to a search what would be the difference between that situation and this situation suppose the breathalyzer test be improve there be good technology so let us suppose that all that be require be to put the breathalyzer a couple of inch an inch from the person s mouth and wait for the person to breathe and that would be sufficient to measure blood alcohol that would you say that be a search all right so if you compare that with what what have to be do here what be the big what be the big difference between those that you have to put a straw in your mouth it do not seem it do not seem realistic the reason why people do not want to submit to a blood alcohol test be that they do not want their blood alcohol measure it be not that they object so much to blow into a straw do you disagree with that could you say something about what the practical consequence of require a warrant for every breathalyzer would be in a state like north dakota i when my picture of north dakota be that it be not like new york city you do not have night court go on all the time and so how many of these test occur during some period of time and how many magistrate would you have on duty let us say at two of the clock in the morning to field a request for a warrant do you know how many breathalyzer test or blood test be administer during any period of time in north dakota per year justice justice sotomayor be assume that you be go to lose so she want to know what your reaction be to that laughter ,216.58,Roberts Court,"Apr 20, 2016",Danny Birchfield,State of North Dakota,14-1468,"Dec 11, 2015","Jun 23, 2016",112,1.0,1.0,1.0,1

And that was my question. Is that correct? Do you defend that? Why should this issue of availability be decided by this Court as opposed to the district court or court of appeals on remand? What is the difference between that and what the statute used to say before it was amended where it required exhaustion of such plain -- plain, speedy, and effective administrative remedies as are available? I think it's saying it has to be plain. You would argue that even if the ARP procedure turns out to have been available as a formal matter, suppose that this -- that issue were remanded, and the district court explored it thoroughly and concluded that, although there's a lot of -- there are these materials that might suggest otherwise, as a formal matter, it is available, even when the IIU procedure is going -- is going forward. All right? I don't know whether that would happen. Maybe it wouldn't. Assume that that's the case. You would still argue that the procedure was unavailable because, although it was available as a former matter -- a formal matter, it is simply too confusing; right? And no reasonable inmate could take advantage of it. That's a separate agreement? As to that argument, your -- your client did not try to use any procedure; isn't that correct? How was he confused?

That's permissible, isn't it? Well, ""any woman"" is broader than ""another woman."" ""Any woman"" means any of 3.5 billion-plus women in the world, and that subsumes ""another woman,"" doesn't it? Well, Moreno and Mejia are two -- are two people; they're not the same person, right? So I assume even if it was -- let's say it was a partnership, they each would be entitled to half of the money, right? So Moreno could conspire with Ocasio to obtain money from Mejia and Mejia could conspire with Ocasio to obtain money from Moreno. Is it fair to say that you are advancing an argument that is limited to the precise language of the Hobbs Act? You -- you are not taking issue with the proposition that a person can conspire to commit offense that the person could not personally commit. And you distinguish the Hobbs Act from the Mann Act because one refers to ""any"" and another refers to ""another."" So is it fair to say that what you want is a special conspiracy rule that applies only in cases of Hobbs Act conspiracies? And if another substantive offense doesn't have the word ""obtain property from"" -- the phrase ""obtain property from another,"" then your -- your rule doesn't apply? What is the relationship between that argument and the question of whether there's a conspiracy between Ocasio and Moreno and Mejia? It might apply to the conspiracy between -- the alleged conspiracy between Ocasio and the other police officers because it -- although it could allow the -- make it easier to admit evidence of what the other police officers did.

2015,Betterman v. Montana,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","What do you make of the fact that the Sixth Amendment says that ""the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury""? Well, when you say prejudice should be presumed, do you mean it should be presumed conclusively? Could it be rebutted? When you say that the -- the remedy should be tailored, tailored to what? What is -- what is the Court supposed to do, in -- in your view? Select a punishment that is appropriate to deter the State from doing this again, or select a remedy that in some way undoes the -- the damage or the prejudice that's been done to the defendant? Okay. Well, then, in that situation, I don't know why reducing the sentence by the length of the unconstitutional delay -- the supposedly unconstitutional delay undoes the damage that's been done by the delay. When Justice Ginsburg asked you about the Federal Speedy Trial Act, and you said that does not cover sentencing. But there are provisions of Montana law that do cover sentencing. Why didn't you seek relief under those? Did you bring a claim under those statutes? Under Montana law, can a -- a defendant who suffers inordinate delay in sentencing get relief? When it comes to the determination of facts that are relevant at sentencing, that does not take place exclusively, or probably even it doesn't take place primarily at the time when the sentence is pronounced; isn't that correct? It -- it takes place during the preparation of the presentence report, at least in the Federal system. Is that true in Montana as well? Well, at the time of the adoption of the Sixth Amendment, weren't post-trial but presentencing delays fairly common? Usually. But -- but not always. But that's just not true as a historical matter. It's not true as a historical matter. If you look at the -- at the first criminal provisions that were enacted by Congress, they called for a range of -- of sentences, and the -- and the sentencing judge had to select within that range. I'm talking about the early 18th century, not when you say that it was automatic. That just isn't true. We don't have the right to change history. It isn't true. The first -- if you look at the very first criminal provisions that were enacted by Congress, the first Congress, they were not. It was not determinate sentencing.

2015,"Tyson Foods, Inc. v. Bouaphakeo",112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Is there any way at this point to determine which employees were actually injured and which ones were not? Because I -- I gathered because the jury rejected the full verdict that was requested by the plaintiffs, they did not accept Dr. Mericle's testimony regarding the amount of time needed to don and doff for employees in various categories. And without knowing that, I don't see how you can at this point -- I'll -- I'll ask Mr. Frederick the same question -- how you can separate the employees who were injured from the employees who were not injured. Well, there is no question the money can be divided up. The question is whether it can be divided up between those who were actually injured and those who were not actually injured. So suppose you have -- if you have three employees, one worked -- one was -- one was given credit for working 39 hours a week, one was given credit for working 38 hours a week, one was given credit for working 37 hours a week. Without knowing how much additional time the -- each employee is entitled to, you can't tell which one of those, which, if any, of them was injured, and you can't tell how much additional time the employees were entitled to without knowing what the jury did with Dr. Mericle's statistics. So that's why I -- I don't see how this can be done in other than a very slap-dash fashion. Could I just ask you to clarify something before your time runs out, because it -- it's unclear to me from what you've said in your argument. Why did Dr. Mericle come up with one figure for employees on the processing floor and another figure for employees on the slaughter floor if, as I understand you to have said this morning, all of the employees basically do both of those tasks and spend an equal amount of time on them, so they can all be considered together? Well, that was the impression I got from what you said. What do you think an employer -- What do you think an employer should do about recordkeeping when the employer believes that certain activities need not be counted under the FLSA? So is the employer -- it may be that the employer is stuck with the choice that it makes, the legal judgment it makes.

Alito, Jr.","If there were a provision of law saying that a jurisdictional determination by the Corps or by the EPA is binding on the federal government in future litigation, would that be reviewable? Well, it would be a different case, but are you able to say whether that would be reviewable under the EPA? Well, let me just ask about how far removed it is. There is no such statute, that certainly is true, but there is a Memorandum of Understanding between the Army and the EPA, and it says, quote, ""case-specific determinations"" -- and I think that includes jurisdictional determinations -- ""made pursuant to the terms of this Memorandum of Understanding will be binding on the government and represent the government's position and any subsequent Federal action or litigation regarding the case."" So is your -- would your argument be that because this is in a Memorandum of Understanding as opposed to a statute or a regulation, the situation is different, and that is insufficient to make the jurisdictional determination reviewable? Well, let's -- let's say in a case where there hasn't been a stand-alone jurisdictional determination and the landowner applies for a permit. The first part of the permitting process, as -- as I understand it, would be a jurisdictional determination; is that right? Okay. And at the end of that, can the landowner get judicial review if the determination is that it -- it is subject to the Clean Water Act; or does the landowner have to go forward, in your view, with the entire -- all the rest of the permitting process before there is a possibility of an administrative appeal and judicial review? The difference between -- Do you see any distinction between a jurisdictional determination by an Article III district judge and a jurisdictional determination by an enforcement Agency? Do you think there might be an argument that it is tolerable to wait until the end of the case when a neutral Article III judge makes an adverse judicial -- an adverse jurisdictional determination, but perhaps less appealing to wait till the end of the adjudication when the jurisdictional determination is made by an enforcement Agency? Well, the premise of the question is that the Army Corps of Engineers is doing this just out of the goodness of its heart; that this is a lot of work for them but they just want to be nice to landowners and that's why they've set up this -- this process. And maybe that's correct, although I understood what you were saying earlier to suggest that that's not quite how you see the process; that they do this for their own purposes because they -- it expands their enforcement power, because landowners who have a question about the status of their land have strong incentive to ask for a jurisdictional determination. And if -- so that alerts the Corps to the fact that this is a property that might be subject to their jurisdiction. And if they issue a negative -- I'm sorry -- an affirmative jurisdictional determination as a practical matter, that's going to mean in most instances that the project is shut down.

2015,Duncan v. Owens,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Let me give you a hypothesis of what he may have been saying, because I think this may be a little bit too hard on the judge. This was an unusual prosecution. It was a murder prosecution where there was no evidence of motive. I think that's pretty rare. The judge may have been saying something like this: I have -- I have identification evidence here. And by the way, I -- I read the -- the whole -- everything -- the whole record and -- that's in the appendix and the closing argument of defense counsel. There was no -- the defense here was not that these were witnesses who made an honest mistake. They just didn't get a good opportunity to see the -- to see the perpetrator. The -- the -- argument of the defense, as I read it very clearly, was that something was going on here and these two witnesses were identifying -- were -- were falsely -- knowingly identifying the wrong person. Something was going on. There's evidence that the victim was selling drugs, very strong evidence that the victim was selling drugs, and that's what was going on here. And so the judge said -- may have said to himself, why does the -- the -- why would the accused take a baseball bat and beat this kid, this 17-year-old kid who has a lot of drugs in his pockets, riding around on a bike? Why would he just beat this kid to death? And there -- he -- I would be concerned about finding this -- the defendant guilty if I thought there was no motive in this case. But I can see that there could well be a motive in this case, because people in the drug trade kill each other. And that seems to be exactly what was going on here. Is that -- is that not a fair interpretation of what the judge was saying? Yes. The one statement that the judge made that you claim is utterly unsupported by the evidence, I gather, is the statement: ""Larry Owens knew he was a drug dealer."" That's the -- that's the only one? Now, there -- could -- there's some evidence from which one might infer that. It might be insufficient. It would depend on the standard of review. But there's evidence that -- that Nelson, the victim, was selling drugs. Could you not infer -- could a reasonable finder of fact not infer from the record here that this kid, this 17-year-old kid with 40 packages of drugs, who's hanging around in front of this -- in front of this bar, was there for the purpose of selling drugs? And the -- and the -- the defendant walked up to -- there's evidence that the defendant walked up to this kid standing in front of the -- of the bar selling drugs, and spoke to him for some period of time, right? Yes, but there's evidence of that, if -- if you believe that, that that took -- that took place, right? There's evidence of that. So could someone infer from those two facts that -- that if this kid was pretty openly selling drugs and the defendant walked up and spoke to him to some -- for some period of time, he knew what he was doing? Now, the question on -- on the merits of -- putting aside the issues of -- of AEDPA and harmless error, when would it -- when does it violate due process for a judge in a bench trial to make a finding on a fact that is not needed for conviction? And what case of ours -- -- sets out the standard for that? What is the -- What is the standard? Well, I'm trying to figure out what the standard is, if you could put it in words. Suppose that the -- the trial judge had made a finding, like the -- the court of appeals appears to, about the -- the -- the time of nautical twilight, and suppose the trial judge was wrong on that. Then what? So the trial judge has made a finding of fact on a fact that's not necessary for conviction. Might conceivably have some relevance to the determination. So what is the due process standard for determining whether that requires a new trial? It depends -- when you're reading this -- in reading what the judge said, it depends on -- the reasonableness of what the judge said may depend on whether you think that the judge inferred that Larry Owens killed the victim because he knew he was a drug dealer, or whether the judge was -- in attempting to fill in the blanks of this case, inferred that he knew he was a drug dealer from the fact that there was proof that he killed him. So if you know that the victim is a drug dealer and the defendant talked to the victim, and then the defendant proceeded to beat his brains out with a baseball bat, you could probably infer from that the reason why he did it was that he knew he was a drug dealer, could you not? ",let me give you a hypothesis of what he may have be say because i think this may be a little bit too hard on the judge this be an unusual prosecution it be a murder prosecution where there be no evidence of motive i think that be pretty rare the judge may have be say something like this i have i have identification evidence here and by the way i i read the the whole everything the whole record and that be in the appendix and the closing argument of defense counsel there be no the defense here be not that these we be witness who make an honest mistake they just do not get a good opportunity to see the to see the perpetrator the the argument of the defense as i read it very clearly be that something be go on here and these two witness we be identify we be we be falsely knowingly identify the wrong person something be go on there be evidence that the victim be sell drug very strong evidence that the victim be sell drug and that be what be go on here and so the judge say may have say to himself why do the the why would the accused take a baseball bat and beat this kid this year old kid who have a lot of drug in his pocket rid around on a bike why would he just beat this kid to death and there he i would be concern about find this the defendant guilty if i think there be no motive in this case but i can see that there could well be a motive in this case because people in the drug trade kill each other and that seem to be exactly what be go on here be that be that not a fair interpretation of what the judge be say yes the one statement that the judge make that you claim be utterly unsupported by the evidence i gather be the statement larry owens know he be a drug dealer that be the that be the only one now there could there be some evidence from which one might infer that it might be insufficient it would depend on the standard of review but there be evidence that that nelson the victim be sell drug could you not infer could a reasonable finder of fact not infer from the record here that this kid this year old kid with package of drug who be hang around in front of this in front of this bar be there for the purpose of sell drug and the and the the defendant walk up to there be evidence that the defendant walk up to this kid stand in front of the of the bar selling drug and speak to him for some period of time right yes but there be evidence of that if if you believe that that that take that take place right there be evidence of that so could someone infer from those two fact that that if this kid be pretty openly sell drug and the defendant walk up and speak to him to some for some period of time he know what he be do now the question on on the merit of put aside the issue of of aedpa and harmless error when would it when do it violate due process for a judge in a bench trial to make a finding on a fact that be not need for conviction and what case of ours set out the standard for that what be the what be the standard well I be try to figure out what the standard be if you could put it in word suppose that the the trial judge have make a finding like the the court of appeal appear to about the the the time of nautical twilight and suppose the trial judge be wrong on that then what so the trial judge have make a finding of fact on a fact that be not necessary for conviction might conceivably have some relevance to the determination so what be the due process standard for determine whether that require a new trial it depend when you be read this in read what the judge say it depend on the reasonableness of what the judge say may depend on whether you think that the judge infer that larry owen kill the victim because he know he be a drug dealer or whether the judge be in attempt to fill in the blank of this case infer that he know he be a drug dealer from the fact that there be proof that he kill him so if you know that the victim be a drug dealer and the defendant talk to the victim and then the defendant proceed to beat his brain out with a baseball bat you could probably infer from that the reason why he do it be that he know he be a drug dealer could you not ,295.45,Roberts Court,"Jan 12, 2016",Stephen Duncan,Lawrence Owens,14-1516,"Oct 1, 2015","Jan 20, 2016",112,0.0,1.0,0.0,0
2015,Zubik v. Burwell,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","You started to talk about -- you started to talk about self-insured plans. Is it the case that the form or the notice to HHS in that instance becomes a plan instrument? Couldn't Congress, or perhaps the Executive, survey the employees of churches and of other -- of religious nonprofits and categories of religious nonprofits, the Little Sisters, a big university, and determine the percentage of employees in each of those groups who are members of the religion and draw a distinction among those groups based on -- on that survey? Couldn't Congress do that? Well, let me mention one of them. Suppose that it were possible for a woman who does not get contraceptive coverage under a grandfathered plan or under a plan offered by a church or under a plan offered by a religious nonprofit to obtain a contraceptive-only policy free of charge on one of the Exchanges. Why would that not be a least -- a less restrictive alternative? What -- what type of a burden does that impose? Is it because these -- these Exchanges are so unworkable, even with the help of a navigator, that -- that a woman who wants to get free contraceptive coverage simply has to sign up for that on -- on one of the Exchanges? So she'll have two insurance cards instead of one. She'll have one from the employer, and she'll have one from this plan, just as a lot of people have one insurance card for medical services and one for prescriptions -- -- for dental or vision. Well, we can talk -- we can talk about that in a minute, but continue with that. But why would that be? He would be -- he would be paid under the -- under the contraceptive plan. Well, you don't think that they would be willing to sell them if you subsidize them at 115 percent, which is what you were doing in the case of those who provide services under self-insured plans. What about the women -- what about the women in grandfathered plans -- -- under -- in grandfathered plans that offer no contraceptive coverage? What about them? But, you know, in the long run we're all dead. But what's going to happen in -- (Laughter.) -- in -- in the interim? What was the reason why Congress did not require contraceptive coverage right away under the grandfathered plans? It required coverage right away under the grandfathered plans for 25-year-olds so that they could get coverage under their parents' health insurance plan. It would have been no great administrative difficulty for the grandfathered plans to put in contraceptive coverage, preventive care coverage right away, just as they did for the 25-year-olds. And yet Congress said, for the really important things, like covering the 25-year-old graduate student, yes, you have to do that right away. But for these other things, including what we're talking about today, you can continue to have -- not to provide that coverage for women as long as you maintain your grandfathered status. Well, but to -- to come back -- to come back to the point that you were making about the Americans with Disabilities Act, that certainly is a good point for the Americans with Disabilities Act. It can be very expensive to retrofit facilities to accommodate people with disabilities. But are you saying that the burden of simply instituting coverage for preventive care as it was done for coverage for 25-year-olds is comparable to making architectural changes? Could you -- could you address Mr. Clement's hypothetical about where the -- the government would come into a -- an unoccupied room in the Little Sisters facility that's not being used for anything. They don't interfere at all. They even pay rent. And they come in there, and they establish a Title X clinic, and they are distributing contraceptives on the Little Sisters property. And there's no financial burden. There's actually financial benefit to them. Is that different from the situation here, and if so, why? Well, you say in your brief, you admit in your brief that, at least in the case of the self-insured plan, the -- the notice or the -- the form or the notice becomes part of the plan. This is their health insurance plan established under ERISA, and you are putting a new objectionable element into the plan. Isn't that correct? But it -- it is -- it's their plan, and you admit that you are putting something into their plan that they object to on religious grounds. So the difference between that and Mr. Clement's hypothetical is that one involves something tangible, physical property, and the other involves something that's intangible. That's the distinction. Well, in the case of an insurance plan, isn't the insurance policy part of the plan? Isn't the insurance policy the way in which the -- the employer provides the benefits that are available under the plan? Well, for the employees who have to buy the plans on the Exchange because they work for a small employer and the employer doesn't offer health insurance, does that arrangement frustrate the government's compelling interest? Couldn't the Executive deal with the problem of what's available on the Exchanges at the present time in this way: Policies are available that provide comprehensive coverage. Could the Executive say, as a matter of our enforcement discretion, we are not going to take any action against insurers who offer contraceptive-only policies, and in fact, we are going to subsidize those insurers at 115 percent, just as we do in the situation of the self-insured plans? Why would that not be -- why would that not be a valid exercise of your enforcement discretion? Well, I understand you're saying it would be inadequate. But why would it be not something that you could do in accordance with your understanding of executive power? Why do you assume that the doctor to whom the women would go for other services under the plan would be unwilling to provide those services under a plan -- under a separate plan that covers contraceptives? Why do you make that assumption? Before you sit down, General Verrilli, could I just ask you this informational question about this particular situation of the Little Sisters? Their regular third-party administrator also will not provide -- has said it will not provide the coverage if -- even if they were to comply with the -- the form of the notice requirement. And, therefore, you say they probably cannot be -- there is probably no way under ERISA to obtain contraceptive coverage for their employees unless you can find another third-party administrator that you could deal with there. In that situation, would the Little Sisters still be subject to fines for failing to comply? Well, that's one way of characterizing what's involved here. But you could also -- it can also be said that, and it is true, that this is a case in which a great array of religious groups -- and it's not just Catholics and Baptists and Evangelicals, but Orthodox Jews, Muslim groups, the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints, an Indian tribe, the Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye -- have said that this presents an unprecedented threat to religious liberty in this country. What would you say to that? ",you start to talk about you start to talk about self insured plan be it the case that the form or the notice to hhs in that instance become a plan instrument could not congress or perhaps the executive survey the employee of church and of other of religious nonprofit and category of religious nonprofit the little sister a big university and determine the percentage of employee in each of

Didn't they say we're going to follow Teague but we want to make it clear we're not bound to do that? They've never -- they've never retracted that have they. Suppose we hold that we can review the -- the -- we have jurisdiction because the State court said it was going to follow Teague. And then we go on and we say that under Teague, Miller can be applied on collateral review. And then the case goes back to the Louisiana Supreme Court, and they said, well, we said previously in Taylor we were going to follow Teague, but that was based on our understanding of Teague at that time. But now that we see what has been interpreted to mean by the U.S. Supreme Court, we're not going to follow Teague. Then what would happen? It would be? Why? Because it said that we would voluntarily follow it in Taylor? That bound them? Well, but when you say that that's a doubtful case, I think you are implicitly acknowledging that, if we adopt your argument, we are going to get that case and lots of similar cases, and we're going to have to parse the words that were -- were -- the words that were used by the State Supreme Court: Well, we're following -- we're going to be guided by it.

2015,Molina-Martinez v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, you say that when there is a -- excuse me -- a miscalculation of the Guidelines range, that should give rise to a rebuttable presumption that the miscalculation affected the sentence that the judge imposed. And what does that mean? Does that mean that the -- the burden of persuasion shifts to the prosecution? Well, suppose there's no evidence, as -- as will -- may very often be the case. Suppose the judge says -- imposes a sentence within what the judge believes to be the Guideline range but says nothing whatsoever beyond that, and it turns out that that is not the correct Guidelines range, so that there's no evidence one way or the other about what the judge would have done had the judge understood the correct Guidelines range. What outcome in that situation? So that means that the burden of persuasion in that situation is on the prosecution. Your argument has some appeal on the facts of this case because the judge sentenced the defendant to a sentence at the bottom of what the judge understood to be the Guideline range. But would your argument apply to any sentence that was within both the original and the correct Guideline range? Suppose the judge here had sentenced your client to 87 months, which I -- I think is the top of the correct Guideline range. Would the same -- would you -- can you infer from that that the judge would not have imposed that sentence had the judge understood that -- the judge thought that the top was 96, judge chose 87, that happens to fall within the correct Guideline range. On those facts, would you infer that the judge would have imposed a lesser sentence? Why would you -- How about -- I mean, the question is, if the judge -- the judge thinks it's 77 to 96 and chooses 87, which is within that range, and it turns out the correct range is 70 to 87, so the 87 is within the correct range as well -- it's the top of the correct range -- what -- what reason would there be to infer -- why would there be a natural probability that the judge would have given a lesser sentence if the judge thought that the top was 87 as opposed to 96? The judge obviously thought in that situation the correct sentence is -- is 87. Well, can you give us an example of a Guidelines error that would qualify for -- qualify as a plain-error except for its failure to satisfy the fourth prong of Olano? If we -- if we accept the -- the proposition that in every case in which there is an incorrect identification of the Guidelines at the time of sentencing there has to be a remand, unless the government can prove with some sort of evidence that it was harmless, would there be any difference between the standard in a case where there was an objection and a case where there was no objection?

But what you're relying is -- you're relying on language that is similar to, maybe, and -- and maybe different in an -- in an important respect; but nevertheless bears some similarity to the residual clause in the -- in the armed criminal -- Armed Career Criminal Act, does it not? May I ask you about the statutory language that seems to me to present the greatest problem for your position. Maybe it's not fatal, but what I'm referring to is the provision that says the term applies -- so we're looking at whether the -- the State offense here is described in the Federal arson statute. And then there's language that says, the term applies to an offense described in this paragraph whether in violation of Federal or State law. What do you make of that? It can be argued that what that means is that, when you have a Federal offense with a jurisdictional provision, you disregard the jurisdictional provision because you're never going to find that in a State provision. But suppose -- Go ahead. Take two -- two defendants. One is convicted of the Federal offense of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, where you have to prove a connection between the firearm and interstate commerce. The second defendant is convicted under an identical State statute, but of course, there's no need to prove an interstate commerce element. And under your argument, the first would be included and the second would not. Why -- why is that? Thank you. Following up on that. But why isn't that true here, in light of the -- the Court's decision in Jones?

No. The question is not whether the New Jersey law somehow abrogates First Amendment rights. The question is whether he has an independent remedy under State law. That's the question, I think, that's being asked. He may have broader substantive rights under New Jersey law. I would be somewhat surprised if that were not the case.

Are any of the Petitioners asking for enhanced damages based on litigation misconduct, for example? We have to decide whether enhanced damages can be awarded solely based on litigation misconduct. That would seem to be a separate question. Or you said that the main thing involved is the nature of the infringement. So what is the issue before us? Are courts going to be able to assess the state of mind of the infringer at the time of the infringer's conduct without getting into communications with the -- with the company's attorneys? Well, this -- you see, you had the case where at the time when the -- the question of enhanced damages is decided, the judge can see that the defense was able to -- with the help of good lawyers, was able to put on an objectively reasonable, although unsuccessful, defense. How are you going to be able to show that the infringer did not have that same information at the time of the conduct in question? The recklessness decision here seems different from those that generally come up. But maybe you can provide an example where this occurs outside of this context. Usually, to determine whether someone was reckless, you have to assess the -- the nature of the risk, the severity of the risk. And in the typical tort case, the severity of the risk may seem greater at the time of trial than it did at the time of the tortfeasor's action, because someone has been harmed. But in this situation, the -- the degree of the risk seems smaller at the time of the determination of enhanced damages than it may have been at the time of -- of the infringement. And I can't think of another -- because it's a legal risk. And the first determination may not have been made with the assistance or very intense analysis by attorneys, and then the latter time, the attorneys are very much involved. Is there any other situation where a recklessness determination has those characteristics? One point Mr. Phillips brought up that you didn't address in your initial argument, maybe you could say a word about it, is Section 298 of the American -- America Invents Act. Under your -- under your reading, could evidence of the failure to obtain or introduce advice of counsel be used to prove that the defendant infringed in bad faith?

Would you say that then an -- that an action under that provision of the New Jersey Securities Act would be one seeking to enforce a Federal duty? But Congress must have -- Congress must have had in mind a certain category of claims that it did not want adjudicated in State court, correct? All right. So you seem to be saying that the category of claims they did not want adjudicated in State court are only these: Those in which the plaintiff is asking for the enforcement of a Federal duty, and there is no comparable State duty at that time, and the State court is unwilling to recognize a comparable State duty in the context of that litigation. So these are essentially cases in which the State is basically hostile to the Federal duty. And those are the only cases that Congress did not want to have adjudicated in State court.

So they go out to party, and one of them -- and they both spend $5,000 partying. One of them spends the money from the bank robbery.

And your position is that the one who spent the money from the so-called ""tainted assets,"" the money from the bank robbery, is entitled to use the remaining $5,000 to hire an attorney, but the other one is out of luck? What sense does that make? The problem with this argument is that as a matter of economics and -- and common sense, money is fungible. To say if the -- if the so-called tainted money has been spent, and what's left is the untainted money, it doesn't make a difference which -- you know, which pot has been spent and which pot hasn't been spent.

Suppose you have the situation where what's at stake is money that's going to be used for restitution, all right? So at the beginning of the case, the question is whether the defendant can spend that money to hire the attorney of the defendant's choice, which is certainly a very powerful interest, or whether that money, at the end of the case if there is a conviction, is going to go to the victims. So how do you -- how do you try to accommodate those two interests? So your answer is that the defendant's right to hire counsel of choice takes precedence over the rights of the victims, and you would say that no matter how strong the proof is? Until there's -- until there is a verdict? I don't -- go ahead and finish. I'm -- I'm troubled by this statute. I -- I can't understand the difference between (a) and (B) I don't think -- the issue was not raised in the cert petition, and I don't know whether it can be brought in with the Doctrine of Constitutional Avoidance, because it really has nothing to do with the Sixth Amendment. This would apply regardless of whether there's any Sixth Amendment issue in the case. But, having said that -- Mr. Srebnick can address those in rebuttal if he wishes to, but having said that, if (B) does not refer to a temporary form of relief, then -- which I understand to be your argument -- then I don't understand what (a) contributes. I don't want to use up your rebuttal time, but I do want to ask you two quick questions about the statute. First is: Did you raise anything about this in your cert petition? And the second is: Is there a way to limit this to the Sixth Amendment context? You didn't say anything about constitutional avoidance in your cert position, did you? ",well let me go back to justice justice kagan s question and ask it in in a different way so you we have two brother and twin brother and they rob a bank they get they split it up each and on that very same day it happen to be their birthday and their rich uncle come and give each of them as a birthday present so they go out to party and one of them and they both spend partying one of them spend the money from the bank robbery the other one spend the money that be give to them by their rich uncle and your position be that the one who spend the money from the so call tainted asset the money from the bank robbery be entitle to use the remain to hire an attorney but the other one be out of luck what sense do that make the problem with this argument be that as a matter of economics and and common sense money be fungible to say if the if the so call tainted money have be spend and what have leave be the untainted money it do not make a difference which you know which pot have be spend and which pot have not be spend well yes but then there be that be all sort of complicated rule in those area i mean let us suppose you have and none of that necessarily applies here suppose you have the situation where what be at stake be money that be go to be use for restitution all right so at the beginning of the case the question be whether the defendant can spend that money to hire the attorney of the defendant s choice which be certainly a very powerful interest or whether that money at the end of the case if there be a conviction be go to go to the victim so how do you how do you try to accommodate those two interest so your answer be that the defendant s right to hire counsel of choice take precedence over the right of the victim and you would say that no matter how strong the proof be until there be until there be a verdict i do not go ahead and finish I be I be trouble by this statute i i can not understand the difference between a and b i do not think the issue be not raise in the cert petition and i do not know whether it can be bring in with the doctrine of constitutional avoidance because it really have nothing to do with the sixth amendment this would apply regardless of whether there be any sixth amendment issue in the case but have say that mr srebnick can address those in rebuttal if he wish to but have say that if b do not refer to a temporary form of relief then which i understand to be your argument then i do not understand what a contributes i do not want to use up your rebuttal time but i do want to ask you two quick question about the statute first be do you raise anything about this in your cert petition and the second be be there a way to limit this to the sixth amendment context you do not say anything about constitutional avoidance in your cert position do you ,183.53000000000003,Roberts Court,"Nov 10, 2015",Sila Luis,United States,14-419,"Jun 8, 2015","Mar 30, 2016",112,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2015,Evenwel v. Abbott,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","There are at least two arguments that could support your position. One is that it's one-person, one-vote, and what counts is giving each person an equal chance of affecting the outcome of the election. But total population figures are a good enough proxy for eligible voters. That's one possible argument. And that's -- that's what the census measures, and that's close enough. Another argument is that representational equality is the real basis, and therefore that's why you use population. So which argument are you making? It seems to me that the two interests are not always consistent. They can be in great conflict. You can have a situation if you -- if you want to equalize population, you may have a situation where you cause great inequality in the -- the chances of any -- of voters affecting the outcome of the election. On the other hand, if you choose eligible voters only, then you may have a situation where every person within two districts does not have an equal representation defined in some way in the legislature. I don't think you can just say, well, it's -- you know, we serve both. What do you do when they come into conflict? Well, can I ask you this? Who has standing to bring a Reynolds v. Sims claim? Is it anybody who is counted in the census? Are you going to tell me who has -- Are you going to tell me who has standing or not? That includes everybody who is counted in the census. It includes -- It includes aliens. It includes prisoners. It includes undocumented aliens. But does it include all those groups? Does it include members of all of those groups? Isn't your argument that voters are -- are irrelevant? What would you say about the extreme case -- I mean, your time is going to going to expire -- an extreme case. And maybe this would never come up, but what if it did? Suppose you have a district -- you have a rural district, and suppose it's a State where the -- the total number of -- the total population per district is -- is fairly small. You have a rural district with a huge prison and very few other inhabitants. So you -- and you have a neighboring district that has no prison. So in one district, you have that 10 percent of the population are eligible voters; and the other district, 90 percent of the -- the population are eligible voters. That would be okay? ",there be at least two argument that could support your position one be that it be one person one vote and what count be give each person an equal chance of affect the outcome of the election but total population figure be a good enough proxy for eligible voter that be one possible argument and that be that be what the census measure and that be close enough another argument be that representational equality be the real basis and therefore that be why you use population so which argument be you make it seem to me that the two interest be not always consistent they can be in great conflict you can have a situation if you if you want to equalize population you may have a situation where you because great inequality in the the chance of any of voter affect the outcome of the election on the other hand if you choose eligible voter only then you may have a situation where every person within two district do not have an equal representation define in some way in the legislature i do not think you can just say well it be you know we serve both what do you do when they come into conflict well can i ask you this who have stand to bring a reynolds v sims claim be it anybody who be count in the census be you go to tell me who have be you go to tell me who have stand or not that include everybody who be count in the census it include it include alien it include prisoner it include undocumented alien but do it include all those group do it include member of all of those group be not your argument that voter be be irrelevant what would you say about the extreme case i mean your time be go to go to expire an extreme case and maybe this would never come up but what if it do suppose you have a district you have a rural district and suppose it be a state where the the total number of the total population per district be be fairly small you have a rural district with a huge prison and very few other inhabitant so you and you have a neighboring district that have no prison so in one district you have that percent of the population be eligible voter and the other district percent of the the population be eligible voter that would be okay ,147.59,Roberts Court,"Dec 8, 2015","Sue Evenwel, et al.","Greg Abbott, Governor of Texas, et al.",14-940,"May 26, 2015","Apr 4, 2016",112,0.0,1.0,1.0,0

2015,Williams v. Pennsylvania,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, what if the case was simply in the office and he had supervisory responsibility over everything that occurs in the office, but it's a big office. If a question arose, somebody could bring it to him, but there isn't any indication of personal involvement. Would that be enough? You see, the problem -- Yeah. The problem that -- that is presented by this case is not -- is where this constitutional line is going to be drawn. You want us to get into -- get pretty deeply into the issue of a constitutional recusal policy for judges. So it's really not enough to just say what happened here was bad. Let's assume that -- that that is the case. Assume for the sake of argument -- I'm not saying one way or the other -- but how far does this go? And that's what I'm -- that's what I'm interested in. So supervisory authority would be enough, you said, but it depends on the issue? Why would it depend on the issue? But that's the -- that's the line-drawing problem. Why does it matter that it's the death penalty? What if it was not a capital case, but he -- he signed the indictment? What if he signed the indictment? He signed the indictment. Let's say the -- the former -- the then-prosecutor signed the indictment, and there are thousands of indictments in a county like Philadelphia, so -- That would be enough? What do you do with the fact that Chief Justice Castille was not solely responsible for the decision in this case? This was a decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Now, you say it was structural error. Suppose that the court had been divided and Chief Justice Castille voted to affirm the decision of the lower court. Would that decision still be invalid on the ground that he shouldn't have been participating? Doesn't that mean it's not structural error? So he might have persuaded a majority to vote to reverse, and then he turned around and he wrote an opinion saying that there should be an affirmance. If we agree with you, doesn't that lead inevitably to the rule that a majority of the judges on a multi-judge panel have the authority to require the recusal of a colleague? Well, wouldn't they -- wouldn't that have to be the consequences? Suppose that -- suppose you make a recusal motion. You want Chief Justice Castille recused, and the other justices on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court say we think that he should be recused, and we're afraid that if we go ahead with this decision with his participation, the decision is going to be subject to attack down the road. And we can't allow that to happen, so we're going to require him to be recused in order to prevent him from tainting our decision-making process or creating at least the appearance that the decision-making process is tainted. So that would have to be a consequence of your rule, would it not? They could just take their chances. And he says, no, I disagree with you. Can we do that -- -- without holding that there was a dupe -- a constitutional violation? What would be our authority to require them to do it over again? When was the last time a prisoner was executed in Pennsylvania, other than those instances in which the prisoner decided that he did not want to pursue appellate remedies? So what's at issue here is only the death penalty, not the conviction itself, correct? And nobody has -- nobody other than these so-called volunteers has been convicted since 1978 -- has been executed since 1978? We're talking about -- We are talking about a constitutional recusal rule which would have very serious consequences. So if it's -- even if it isn't absolutely necessary that that rule be very clear, certainly it is highly desirable that it be very clear so that everybody can determine with a degree of certainty when the time -- when the decision is made whether recusal is constitutionally required or not. And I really don't see a clear rule that would encompass this situation, other than a rule that said that a judge may -- is required by the Constitution to recuse in any case in which the judge had personal participation as a prosecutor. Anything other than that seems to me to be pretty fuzzy, but that would be a pretty far-reaching rule. So can you think of one that is less -- that is not as far-reaching as that but nevertheless is clear? If we talk about the number of years that passed or how significant the -- how significant the issue was or things of that nature, those are all going to be subject to a lot of uncertainty and debate. In -- in -- Well, I -- In this case, did the other justices of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court know about the recusal motion at the time of the decision? Well, this may be an extreme case, but if we do not say any personal participation requires recusal under the Constitution, what other clear line can you give us? ",well what if the case be simply in the office and he have supervisory responsibility over everything that occur in the office but it be a big office if a question arose somebody could bring it to him but there be not any indication of personal involvement would that be enough you see the problem yeah the problem that that be present by this case be not be where this constitutional line be go to be draw you want us to get into get pretty deeply into the issue of a constitutional recusal policy for judge so it be really not enough to just say what happen here be bad let us assume that that that be the case assume for the sake of argument I be not say one way or the other but how far do this go and that be what I be that be what I be interested in so supervisory authority would be enough you say but it depend on the issue why would it depend on the issue but that be the that be the line draw problem why do it matter that it be the death penalty what if it be not a capital case but he he sign the indictment what if he sign the indictment he sign the indictment let us say the the former the then prosecutor sign the indictment and there be thousand of indictment in a county like philadelphia so that would be enough what do you do with the fact that chief justice castille be not solely responsible for the decision in this case this be a decision by the pennsylvania supreme court now you say it be structural error suppose that the court have be divide and chief justice castille vote to affirm the decision of the low court would that decision still be invalid on the ground that he should not have be participate do not that mean it be not structural error so he might have persuade a majority to vote to reverse and then he turn around and he write an opinion say that there should be an affirmance if we agree with you do not that lead inevitably to the rule that a majority of the judge on a multi judge panel have the authority to require the recusal of a colleague well would not they would not that have to be the consequence suppose that suppose you make a recusal motion you want chief justice castille recuse and the other justice on the pennsylvania supreme court say we think that he should be recuse and we be afraid that if we go ahead with this decision with his participation the decision be go to be subject to attack down the road and we can not allow that to happen so we be go to require him to be recuse in order to prevent him from taint our decision make process or create at least the appearance that the decision making process be taint so that would have to be a consequence of your rule would it not they could just take their chance and he say no i disagree with you can we do that without hold that there be a dupe a constitutional violation what would be our authority to require them to do it over again when be the last time a prisoner be execute in pennsylvania other than those instance in which the prisoner decide that he do not want to pursue appellate remedy so what be at issue here be only the death penalty not the conviction itself correct and nobody have nobody other than these so called volunteer have be convict since have be execute since we be talk about we be talk about a constitutional recusal rule which would have very serious consequence so if it be even if it be not absolutely necessary that that rule be very clear certainly it be highly desirable that it be very clear so that everybody can determine with a degree of certainty when the time when the decision be make whether recusal be constitutionally require or not and i really do not see a clear rule that would encompass this situation other than a rule that say that a judge may be require by the constitution to recuse in any case in which the judge have personal participation as a prosecutor anything other than that seem to me to be pretty fuzzy but that would be a pretty far reach rule so can you think of one that be less that be not as far reach as that but nevertheless be clear if we talk about the number of year that pass or how significant the how significant the issue be or thing of that nature those be all go to be subject to a lot of uncertainty and debate in in well i in this case do the other justice of the pennsylvania supreme court know about the recusal motion at the time of the decision well this may be an extreme case but if we do not say any personal participation require recusal under the constitution what other clear line can you give us ,323.46,Roberts Court,"Feb 29, 2016",Terrance Williams,Pennsylvania,15-5040,"Oct 1, 2015","Jun 9, 2016",112,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

2015,Kansas v. Carr,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, would this second jury have been present for the -- for the guilt phase? Do you think that the desire to spare Holly from having to testify more than once is a relevant factor here? And if so, how could that be -- how do you -- how would you propose to accommodate them? You would have -- the State would have to put on, basically, its guilt phase case again at the penalty phase, right? Well, I am sure you'd like to stipulate to all the facts that were proven at the guilt phase, but I doubt that the State is going to want to stipulate to those. Isn't it true, General Schmidt, that it makes a big difference whether this is done under the Federal Constitution or under Kansas law? And presumably, the Kansas Supreme Court understood that it had the capability of basing its decision on Kansas law. But if -- if it did that, it would have to take responsibility for the decisions in these cases, which involve some of the most horrendous murders that I have seen in my 10 years here. And we see practically every death penalty case that comes up anywhere in the country. These have to rank as among the worst. So it didn't take responsibility for that. It said it's the Eighth Amendment, and we have to apply the Federal Constitution. Now, it may be they will say, well, we're going to say that Kansas law requires this, but then it's their responsibility; isn't that true? Well, I wasn't speculating on why they did what they did, but the consequences of basing it on the Federal Constitution. One of the consequences of basing it on the Federal Constitution is that they don't have to take responsibility for it. But would it not be true that the Kansas issue -- the Kansas law issue could be raised in a State collateral proceeding? Why is a remand necessary? In the ordinary case, let's say a State Supreme Court decides an issue. They make no -- they make no reference whatsoever to State law. They based it on the Federal Constitution. It comes up here; we reverse. We would not remand and say, well, you didn't say anything about State law, but it's possible that you might want to find that the same rule applies under State law. We wouldn't do it in that situation, would we? In every case like that we would remand? Well, is that what we have done in such cases? We've remanded all of those for them to say, well, you didn't mention State law, but maybe you want to think about State law? All right. If we assume for the sake of argument that we would not do that in every case, then what you are proposing is that we do it here because you think there's a sufficient -- there's sufficient uncertainty about the basis for the decision. And then we're going to add that into the situation in all of these cases of deciding, is there enough? Well, they cited some State cases, they might -- we're going to have to be making these decisions in every one of these cases. Well, I have the same question. Suppose the jury is instructed you -- mitigators do not have to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. And then the jury sends a question, well, what is the burden of proof on mitigators? How should the trial judge answer that? If were on a -- I'm sorry. Finish the sentence. If -- if I were on a jury and I were told that the burden -- that mitigators do not have to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, I would find that confusing because then I would ask what is the -- the burden of proof on mitigators? And I don't think there's any way, really, to answer that question. So maybe this is a situation like trying to define reasonable doubt where less is more. It's better not to get into the question of burden of proof at all. And let me -- just to finish this -- this suggestion, and maybe it's misdirected, but you mentioned the mitigator of -- of child abuse. What would -- if there is any burden of proof, what would be the fact as to which it would apply? The overall category that this person had a bad childhood or that the -- the individual was beaten by his mother or beaten by his father or subjected to sexual abuse or was around people who were using drugs? Unless you define what the mitigators are, which can't be done, I don't see how you can apply any kind of burden of proof. What does it mean to say there's no burden of proof? Every juror decides individually? ",well would this second jury have be present for the for the guilt phase do you think that the desire to spare holly from have to testify more than once be a relevant factor here and if so how could that be how do you how would you propose to accommodate them you would have the state would have to put on basically its guilt phase case again at the penalty phase right well i be sure you would like to stipulate to all the fact that we be prove at the guilt phase but i doubt that the state be go to want to stipulate to those be not it true general schmidt that it make a big difference whether this be do under the federal constitution or under kansa law and presumably the kansa supreme court understand that it have the capability of base its decision on kansa law but if if it do that it would have to take responsibility for the decision in these case which involve some of the most horrendous murder that i have see in my year here and we see practically every death penalty case that come up anywhere in the country these have to rank as among the bad so it do not take responsibility for that it say it be the eighth amendment and we have to apply the federal constitution now it may be they will say well we be go to say that kansas law require this but then it be their responsibility be not that true well i be not speculate on why they do what they do but the consequence of base it on the federal constitution one of the consequence of base it on the federal constitution be that they do not have to take responsibility for it but would it not be true that the kansa issue the kansa law issue could be raise in a state collateral proceeding why be a remand necessary in the ordinary case let us say a state supreme court decide an issue they make no they make no reference whatsoever to state law they base it on the federal constitution it come up here we reverse we would not remand and say well you do not say anything about state law but it be possible that you might want to find that the same rule applies under state law we would not do it in that situation would we in every case like that we would remand well be that what we have do in such case we have remand all of those for them to say well you do not mention state law but maybe you want to think about state law all right if we assume for the sake of argument that we would not do that in every case then what you be propose be that we do it here because you think there be a sufficient there be sufficient uncertainty about the basis for the decision and then we be go to add that into the situation in all of these case of decide be there enough well they cite some state case they might we be go to have to be make these decision in every one of these case well i have the same question suppose the jury be instruct you mitigators do not have to be prove beyond a reasonable doubt and then the jury send a question well what be the burden of proof on mitigators how should the trial judge answer that if we be on a I be sorry finish the sentence if if i we be on a jury and i we be tell that the burden that mitigators do not have to be prove beyond a reasonable doubt i would find that confuse because then i would ask what be the the burden of proof on mitigators and i do not think there be any way really to answer that question so maybe this be a situation like try to define reasonable doubt where less be more it be well not to get into the question of burden of proof at all and let me just to finish this this suggestion and maybe it be misdirect but you mention the mitigator of of child abuse what would if there be any burden of proof what would be the fact as to which it would apply the overall category that this person have a bad childhood or that the the individual be beat by his mother or beat by his father or subject to sexual abuse or be around people who we be use drug unless you define what the mitigators be which can not be do i do not see how you can apply any kind of burden of proof what do it mean to say there be no burden of proof every juror decide individually ,259.6,Roberts Court,"Oct 7, 2015",Kansas,Jonathan and Reginald Carr,14-449,"Mar 30, 2015","Jan 20, 2016",112,1.0,1.0,0.0,1

So suppose you win here, and the State then examines what happened in each of these clinics and comes up with evidence showing that in quite a few instances, the closure was due to other factors. And so then they would -- then could they take the position, well, the decision of this Court holding that the law is facially unconstitutional is not binding on us by res judicata, and so you would have to sue them again, and they would be able to make the same argument you're making now. Is that correct? What's the difference? Was it that -- was that their burden? As to how many, of the total that you claim closed, do you have direct evidence about the reason for the closure? Yeah. And as to how many -- how many are you claiming total closed as a result of the law? And of the 20, how -- as to how many do you have direct evidence? Because if -- if you go through this -- now we're not talking about a huge number of facilities. I really don't understand why you could not have put in evidence about each particular clinic and to show why the clinic closed. And as to some of them, there is -- there's information that they closed for reasons that had nothing to do with this law. Now, maybe when you take out all of those, there still would be a substantial number, and enough to make your case. But I -- I don't understand why you didn't put in direct evidence. I mean, I could give you examples: Planned Parenthood Center for Choice, Bryan, Texas. Is that one of the ones you're talking about? Okay. There's a news report. Planned Parenthood and -- and the Huffington Post reported that this was closed as a result of the 2011 Texas Women's Health Program bill, which cut funding for family planning services. It's not the law that we're talking about here. Well, I understand that. And you put quite a bit of evidence that's not in the record in your brief. But my point is why is there not direct evidence about particular clinics? Is it correct that the number of ambulatory surgical centers performing abortion has increased by 50 percent since this law went into effect? Well, one -- one quick question about capacity. I don't want to take your rebuttal time. But your co-counsel put in -- is also litigating a case like this in Louisiana. And in that case, the plaintiffs were able to put in evidence about the exact number of abortions that were performed in all of the facilities. Why could that not have been done here? Why wasn't it done here? Is this true of every provision of the -- of the ASC law? Not the regulations -- yes, in the regulations. Every single provision. Then why was the whole thing held to be unconstitutional? But there are -- there are things that go -- that go -- I haven't checked everything as compared the abortion -- the prior abortion clinic licensing law against the ASC requirements, but there are some where there's an increase in what's required. It seems pretty reasonable. Under the -- under the -- the old -- the old law, there had to be a nurse, but not necessarily a registered nurse. Under the new law, there has to be a registered nurse who has a CPR certificate. So do you think that's unreasonable to say that there has to be a registered nurse who knows how to do CPR? Well, it's all -- It's work, but maybe the district court should have done that work. I mean, I read through this, and I was surprised. I read through these regulations. I was surprised by how many are completely innocuous. And many of them have nothing to do -- they have to do with basic safety. They don't even have anything to do, in particular, with abortion. So the entrances to the clinic have to be at grade level. You have to have an elevator. The -- the corridors have to be wide enough so that you could bring in a stretcher if somebody has to be taken to the hospital. And -- and things of that nature -- I don't know why things couldn't have been severed out, if there were some that were -- There is no evidence -- there's no evidence of the actual capacity of these clinics. And why was that not put in? Particularly since, if we look at the Louisiana case, we can see that it's very possible to put it in. And some of the -- some of the numbers there are quite -- quite amazing. There's one -- a doctor there performed 3,000 abortions in a year. So we don't really know what the capacity of these -- of these ASC clinics -- -- are. Yeah. But what is it based on? It's based -- you know, he -- it's not based on any hard -- any hard statistics. Well, common sense -- He said that -- that the number of -- the percentage of abortions at the ASCs went down by 4.4 percent, and there was an increased demand for abortion. But there's no statistic showing that there actually was an increased demand for abortion in Texas. Would it not be the case that -- would it not be the case that a State could increase the -- the standard of care as high as it wants so long as there's not an -- an undue burden on the women seeking abortion? So, you know, if they could -- if they could increase the standard of care up to the very highest anywhere in the country and it wouldn't be a burden on the women, well, that would be a benefit to them. Would there be anything unconstitutional about that? Isn't it true -- General, as to -- as to rogue facilities, which Justice Kagan just mentioned, one of the amicus briefs cites instance after instance where Whole Woman's facilities have been cited for really appalling violations when they were inspected: Holes in the floor where -- where rats could come in, the lack of any equipment to adequately sterilize instruments. Is that not the case? These are not stories -- These are, as I understand it, actual reports of -- of inspections of those facilities. Gosnell. And as to the -- the clinics where there is direct evidence, does the direct evidence show whether the cause was the admitting-privileges requirement or the ASC requirement or both? Do you think that Federal district judges or this Court is well qualified to determine whether there is a different risk, regard -- with respect to abortion, as compared to other procedures, that may or may not have to be required -- may or may not have to be performed in an -- in an ASC? ",well there be very little specific evidence in the record in this case with respect to why any particular clinic close basically your argument be that the law take effect and after that point there be a decrease in the number of clinic so suppose you win here and the state then examine what happen in each of these clinic and come up with evidence show that in quite a few instance the closure be due to other factor and so then they would then could they take the position well the decision of this court hold that the law be facially unconstitutional be not bind on us by re judicata and so you would have to sue them again and they would be able to make the same argument you be make now be that correct what be the difference be it that be that their burden as to how many of the total that you claim close do you have direct evidence about the reason for the closure yeah and as to how many how many be you claim total close as a result of the law and of the how as to how many do you have direct evidence because if if you go through this now we be not talk about a huge number of facility i really do not understand why you could not have put in evidence about each particular clinic and to show why the clinic close and as to some of them there be there be information that they close for reason that have nothing to do with this law now maybe when you take out all of those there still would be a substantial number and enough to make your case but i i do not understand why you do not put in direct evidence i mean i could give you example plan parenthood center for choice bryan texas be that one of the one you be talk about okay there be a news report plan parenthood and and the huffington post report that this be close as a result of the texas woman s health program bill which cut funding for family planning service it be not the law that we be talk about here well i understand that and you put quite a bit of evidence that be not in the record in your brief but my point be why be there not direct evidence about particular clinic be it correct that the number of ambulatory surgical center perform abortion have increase by percent since this law go into effect well one one quick question about capacity i do not want to take your rebuttal time but your co counsel put in be also litigate a case like this in louisiana and in that case the plaintiff we be able to put in

2015,Foster v. Chatman,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","What if the State supreme court wrote a very short opinion and said, We're not going to determine whether there was, in fact -- the only issue we're going to determine is whether there's any arguable merit to this? And then you say that the whole issue of whether it was a correct application in Batson is -- is the issue that we have to decide? Could I ask you another -- a question about another preliminary issue before you get to the -- the -- the underlying question in the case? The Superior Court said, on page 175 of the Joint Appendix, that the issue of the Batson violation was not reviewable based on the doctrine of res judicata. And then it later said, and this is 192 of the Joint Appendix, that it will review the Batson claim as to whether Petitioner has shown any change in the facts sufficient to overcome the res judicata bar. Now, if you put those two together, you could argue that the superior court decided only a question of State law, namely, whether the situation here was such that there could be review of the Batson claim. What is your response to that? Well, I don't want to belabor the point too much, but you -- are you arguing that Georgia res judicata law is this: If someone comes up with any new fact, the -- the -- the thinnest new fact, that is sufficient to wipe out the res judicata bar and allow the court to get to the merits of the claim? Is that your argument? That's your understanding of Georgia res judicata law? Don't you think this is -- this is a case-by-case thing? Suppose there's one reason that's a killer reason? Like this -- this individual has numerous prior felony convictions, all right? And then the prosecutor says in addition, and this -- this person didn't -- he looked down at the floor in answering the questions and didn't seem to pause and didn't seem to understand some of the questions. So under a circumstance like that, couldn't the Court say, well, the one -- there's one reason here that would -- that is clearly a justification for a peremptory strike? We don't have to determine whether there's evidence that the person was looking down at the floor. Did Mr. Lanier testify -- Well, didn't he also testify -- this is on 14 of the reply brief -- it has come to our attention since the trial of this case that Angela Garrett was arrested? What about the -- what about the giving a reason for dismissing her that she was close in age to the defendant? She was in her 30s. He was 18 or 19. What do you think is Georgia res judicata law? The res judicata goes out the window. What do you make of the statement on 175, ""As a preliminary matter, this court notes that, as cited by the Respondent, the following claims are not reviewable based on the doctrine of res judicata""? And the first one it lists is the Batson claim. Does that suggest maybe the court had two reasons for what it did? It's barred by res judicata, and it would fail even if it were not. Well, I'd like the -- I'm sorry. I'd like counsel -- (Laughter.) ",what if the state supreme court write a very short opinion and say we be not go to determine whether there be in fact the only issue we be go to determine be whether there be any arguable merit to this and then you say that the whole issue of whether it be a correct application in batson be be the issue that we have to decide could i ask you another a question about another preliminary issue before you get to the the the underlying question in the case the superior court say on page of the joint appendix that the issue of the batson violation be not reviewable base on the doctrine of re judicata and then it later say and this be of the joint appendix that it will review the batson claim as to whether petitioner have show any change in the fact sufficient to overcome the re judicata bar now if you put those two together you could argue that the superior court decide only a question of state law namely whether the situation here be such that there could be review of the batson claim what be your response to that well i do not want to belabor the point too much but you be you argue that georgia res judicata law be this if someone come up with any new fact the the the thin new fact that be sufficient to wipe out the re judicata bar and allow the court to get to the merit of the claim be that your argument that be your understanding of georgia re judicata law do not you think this be this be a case by case thing suppose there be one reason that be a killer reason like this this individual have numerous prior felony conviction all right and then the prosecutor say in addition and this this person do not he look down at the floor in answer the question and do not seem to pause and do not seem to understand some of the question so under a circumstance like that could not the court say well the one there have one reason here that would that be clearly a justification for a peremptory strike we do not have to determine whether there be evidence that the person be look down at the floor do mr lanier testify well do not he also testify this be on of the reply brief it have come to our attention since the trial of this case that angela garrett be arrest what about the what about the give a reason for dismiss her that she be close in age to the defendant she be in her he be or what do you think be georgia re judicata law the re judicata go out the window what do you make of the statement on as a preliminary matter this court note that as cite by the respondent the following claim be not reviewable base on the doctrine of re judicata and the first one it list be the batson claim do that suggest maybe the court have two reason for what it do it be bar by re judicata and it would fail even if it we be not well I would like the I be sorry I have like counsel laughter ,193.37,Roberts Court,"Nov 2, 2015",Timothy Tyrone Foster,"Bruce Chatman, Warden",14-8349,"May 26, 2015","May 23, 2016",112,1.0,1.0,1.0,1

2015,Sheriff v. Gillie,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","I don't really see the difference between those two situations. But even to push the point a little bit further, suppose the State created a special seal for the special debt collections program of the State of Ohio or something like that, and they put that at the top of the letterhead. Would that be a violation of the statute? It's the seal of the State of Ohio, and it says ""The Program of Special Debt Collection."" Why would it be misleading? What would the recipient of that letter think that the recipient of the letter would not think if that recipient received the letter from the actual office of the attorney general? I thought Justice Kagan asked you a functional question, and you are responding with a formal answer. And you may win on formal grounds, but if we could go back to the functional point. Let's suppose that I received two letters. One is the letter, and I owe a debt to the State of Ohio. And one is the letter that was sent in this case; the other is a letter that's identical except that it is signed by an assistant attorney general of the State of Ohio. Why do I have a different reaction to the former letter as opposed to the latter? No, you're not answering my question. I wasn't asking you to compare the letter that was sent with a letter that makes no reference to the Attorney General of Ohio. I'm asking you to compare a letter that is sent by an assistant attorney general, identical in all other respects to the letter that was sent in this case with the type of letter that was sent here. What -- is there a difference in the reaction of the average consumer, the least sophisticated consumer, to those two letters? Suppose -- Suppose that the special counsel prepares a letter just like the letter that's -- that was issued in this -- letters issued in this case. But before they send it, they take it to the attorney's office -- attorney general's office. They show it to somebody there. And they say, do you authorize me to send this? And the person says, yes, you're authorized to send it. Would it be misleading under those circumstances? Even though it's approved -- suppose that they -- they take it to General DeWine, and they say, General, I would like to send this. Am I authorized to send it? He says, yes, that's fine. That's still misleading?

2015,Fisher v. University of Texas,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Could I come back to the issue of classroom diversity? Because that does seem to me to be something that could be measured. And maybe there's evidence in the record that measures it. I don't know. So that's what I want to ask you. But the University knows which students, even if -- assuming that the students don't know, this University knows which students were admitted because they were in the top 10 percent and which were not. And presumably they have a record of all of the classes and which students enrolled in which classes. And so it would seem to me to be possible to determine whether the students who were admitted under the 10 percent plan were less likely to choose to enroll in the classes in which minorities are underrepresented than the students who were admitted under holistic review. Now, maybe that's in the record. I haven't found it. Is there anything in the record to show that? Well, the issue in this case is not whether the University can have holistic review. The issue is whether they can have as a component of holistic review after they have taken into account other characteristics that are not dependent on race; they can add race as an additional characteristic. And so if it were -- is there -- would there be any way of determining, if there were a remand, which of the non-top 10 admittees were admitted solely because of race? In other words, these students would not have been admitted taking into account leadership and family, education and socioeconomic background and hardship and everything else. Well, on that point, can you determine which of the holistic admittees would not have been admitted if race was not added to the -- to the determination? That's not really my question. My question was if you look at an individual person, can you tell whether that person was admitted because -- solely because of race? Whether that person would not have been admitted were it not for the fact that the person was an African-American or Hispanic? What -- one of the things I find troubling about your argument is the suggestion that there is something deficient about the African-American students and the Hispanic students who are admitted under the Top 10 Percent Plan. They're not dynamic. They're not leaders. They're not change agents. And I don't know what the basis for that is. It's -- really it's based on a terrible stereotyping that -- What is the basis for that -- Yeah. But what is the basis for saying that? That's what I don't understand. It's kind of the assumption that if the -- if a student -- if a black student or a Hispanic student is admitted as part of the Top 10 Percent Plan, it has to be because that student didn't have to compete against very many whites and -- and Asians. In -- in the high school class, it's a really pernicious stereotype. I don't doubt that that is one of the things that it does, and I would have thought that that would be something that you would regard as beneficial. Wasn't that the -- the reason for adopting affirmative action in the first place because there are people who have been severely disadvantaged through discrimination and -- and lack of wealth, and they should be given a benefit in admission -- -- but that's one -- one of the things that it does, but it's not the only thing that it does. This is a statistic that jumped out at me, which it seems to me contrary to the stereotype on which the Fifth Circuit panel proceeds and on which you proceed. Of the African-American and Hispanic students who were admitted under the Top 10 Percent Plan, 21 percent had parents who had either a bachelor's degree or a four-year degree. And for the holistic admittees, African-Americans and Hispanics, it's 26 percent. This is from a Class of 2008. So there isn't -- it seems to me it refutes the idea that all of these minority students who were admitted under -- or most of them admitted under the 10 percent plan come just from these predominantly overwhelmingly black and Hispanic schools with poor students. It's just -- it doesn't seem to be true. Well, on that subject, I don't know of any -- you haven't mentioned in your briefs anything that the University of Texas has done to increase racial diversity at the classroom level, other than this admissions program. And I mentioned during your -- your friend's argument a way in which you could determine whether the top 10 admittees are any more or less likely to enroll in classes -- small classes where there is a lack of racial diversity than the holistic admittees. And I don't see -- and you haven't made any effort, as far as I can tell, to measure that. But I don't -- you could have determined whether this is -- whether the admission -- the addition of race to the holistic equation has done anything to increase classroom diversity. And you haven't done that. No. As -- as comparing, this goes back to your -- your underlying claim is there's something deficient about the top 10 admittees, and I -- maybe -- if you have -- do you have evidence that they are less likely to -- to enroll in the classes where there's a lack of classroom diversity -- Well, I -- but that's where I'm looking for evidence that that's true. What is it -- what is it -- have you looked at the top 10 percent admittees, for example, to see how many of them are leaders, which is certainly -- and certainly a legitimate factor to look for, students who are leaders. At -- do you say, well, there are -- there are just not very many leaders here; these are students who all they do is study. There's no evidence of that as far as I can tell. I don't know what that -- I don't know what that proves. Sure. I -- I'm sure that there are holistic admittees who were great students. They made a wonderful contribution to the university. I'll -- I don't know whether you're going to be able to determine that they would have not -- they would not have been admitted if race hadn't been taken into account. They probably -- they would have -- many of them would have been. Maybe all of them. But beyond that, what is to say that there are not comparable students who were among the top 10 percent admittees? I bet there are. I -- I could use -- I can use the help. (Laughter.) Well -- well, that's my question. But -- (Laughter.) Well, there's an aspect of the holistic review process done at the University of Texas which may militate against the admission of African-American and Hispanic students for a -- an ostensibly race-neutral reason, and that is, that as I understand it, standardized test scores count pretty heavily in that process. One of the things the University says it's looking for is students with high SAT scores who are not in the top 10 percent of their class. And there are many who think that SAT scores and ACT scores are culturally biased. So if you put less emphasis on that, you might not have the numbers that you just recited. Well, it's rather strange that we -- we construct a process that may disadvantage African-American and Hispanic students for an ostensibly race-neutral reason. So then we have to add race in as a special factor to counteract that. I thought the -- I thought the record showed the Top Ten admittees have a higher grade point average than the holistic African-American and Hispanic admittees. But, I mean, once they get to -- Once they get to -- the SAT is supposed to predict how you are going to do in college. And I thought the record showed that the students who had lower SAT scores but did better as a -- by measure by high school rank did better at the University of Texas; isn't that -- isn't that the case? But do you think that the African-American and Hispanic students who were admitted under the Top 10 Percent Plan make inferior officers when compared to those who were admitted under holistic review? Do you think that the -- that the ROTC graduates from the University of Texas make superior officers to those who -- who graduate from, let's say, Texas A&M or Texas Tech? Now, that's certainly important, but to come back to my first question, is there anything to suggest that the top 10 percent students are less likely to enroll in ROTC or, when they do, they're not as good as the -- as the holistic admittees? ",could i come back to the issue of classroom diversity because that do seem to me to be something that could be measure and maybe there be evidence in the record that measure it i do not know so that be what i want to ask you but the university know which student even if assume that the student do not know this university know which student we be admit because they we be in the top percent and which we be not and presumably they have a record of all of the class and which student enrol in which class and so it would seem to me to be possible to determine whether the student who we be admit under the percent plan we be less likely to choose to enroll in the class in which minority be underrepresented than the student who we be admit under holistic review now maybe that be in the record i have not find it be there anything in the record to show that well the issue in this case be not whether the university can have holistic review the issue be whether they can have as a component of holistic review after they have take into account other characteristic that be not dependent on race they can add race as an additional characteristic and so if it we be be there would there be any way of determine if there we be a remand which of the non top admittees we be admit solely because of race in other word these student would not have be admit take into account leadership and family education and socioeconomic background and hardship and everything else well on that point can you determine which of the holistic admittees would not have be admit if race be not add to the to the determination that be not really my question my question be if you look at an individual person can you tell whether that person be admit because solely because of race whether that person would not have be admit we be it not for the fact that the person be an african american or hispanic what one of the thing i find trouble about your argument be the suggestion that there be something deficient about the african american student and the hispanic student who be admit under the top percent plan they be not dynamic they be not leader they be not change agent and i do not know what the basis for that be it be really it be base on a terrible stereotyping that what be the basis for that yeah but what be the basis for say that that be what i do not understand it be kind of the assumption that if the if a student if a black student or a hispanic student be admit as part of the top percent plan it have to be because that student do not have to compete against very many white and and asian in in the high school class it be a really pernicious stereotype i do not doubt that that be one of the thing that it do and i would have think that that would be something that you would regard as beneficial be not that the the reason for adopt affirmative action in the first place because there be people who have be severely disadvantage through discrimination and and lack of wealth and they should be give a benefit in admission but that be one one of the thing that it do but it be not the only thing that it do this be a statistic that jump out at me which it seem to me contrary to the stereotype on which the fifth circuit panel proceeds and on which you proceed of the african american and hispanic student who we be admit under the top percent plan percent have parent who have either a bachelor s degree or a four year degree and for the holistic admittees african american and hispanic it be percent this be from a class of so there be not it seem to me it refute the idea that all of these minority student who we be admit under or most of them admit under the percent plan come just from these predominantly overwhelmingly black and hispanic school with poor student it be just it do not seem to be true well on that subject i do not know of any you have not mention in your brief anything that the university of texas have do to increase racial diversity at the classroom level other than this admission program and i mention during your your friend s argument a way in which you could determine whether the top admittees be any more or less likely to enroll in class small class where there be a lack of racial diversity than the holistic admittees and i do not see and you have not make any effort as far as i can tell to measure that but i do not you could have determine whether this be whether the admission the addition of race to the holistic equation have do anything to increase classroom diversity and you have not do that no as as comparing this go back to your your underlying claim be there be something deficient about the top admittees and i maybe if you have do you have evidence that they be less likely to to enroll in the class where there be a lack of classroom diversity well i but that be where I be look for evidence that that be true what be it what be it have you look at the top percent admittees for example to see how many of them be leader which be certainly and certainly a legitimate factor to look for student who be leader at do you say well there be there be just not very many leader here these be student who all they do be study there be no evidence of that as far as i can tell i do not know what that i do not know what that prove sure i I be sure that there be holistic admittees who we be great student they make a wonderful contribution to the university I will i do not know whether you be go to be able to determine that they would have not they would not have be admit if race have not be take into account they probably they would have many of them would have be maybe all of them but beyond that what be to say that there be not comparable student who we be among the top percent admittees i bet there be i i could use i can use the help laughter well well that be my question but laughter well there be an aspect of the holistic review process do at the university of texas which may militate against the admission of african american and hispanic student for a an ostensibly race neutral reason and that be that as i understand it standardized test score count pretty heavily in that process one of the thing the university say it be look for be student with high sat score who be not in the top percent of their class and there be many who think that sit score and act score be culturally bias so if you put less emphasis on that you might not have the number that you just recite well it be rather strange that we we construct a process that may disadvantage african american and hispanic student for an ostensibly race neutral reason so then we have to add race in as a special factor to counteract that i think the i think the record show the top ten admittees have a high grade point average than the holistic african american and hispanic admittees but i mean once they get to once they get to the sat be suppose to predict how you be go to do in college and i think the record show that the student who have low sat score but do well as a by measure by high school rank do good at the university of texas be not that be not that the case but do you think that the african american and hispanic student who we be admit under the top percent plan make inferior officer when compare to those who we be admit under holistic review do you think that the that the rotc graduate from the university of texas make superior officer to those who who graduate from let us say texas a m or texas tech now that be certainly important but to come back to my first question be there anything to suggest that the top percent student be less likely to enroll in rotc or when they do they be not as good as the as the holistic admittees ,484.59,Roberts Court,"Dec 9, 2015",Abigail Noel

2015,Mathis v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, there are a lot of reasons why Iowa might want to take the approach that it -- that it does. Suppose the person is convicted -- suppose the evidence involves the burglary of a trailer. So you'd have the rather ridiculous situation of a jury -- if that was -- if those are separate elements, then if six of the jurors thought, well, this trailer is not very movable, so I think it's a house, and the other others say, well, you know, it's possible you could hook it up to a truck and move it, so it's a vehicle. So there couldn't be an agreement, and the defendant would be acquitted. That's a rather strange result that the Iowa legislature might want to avoid. But you want to attribute the same -- you want to -- you want to say the Massachusetts legislature in the case of a houseboat would permit the same thing? You have no Massachusetts case that says that. Well, maybe they have more houseboats in Massachusetts than they do in Vermont. (Laughter.) Well, the point is, what is the Federal -- under your approach, what is the Federal sentencing court supposed to do in the situation like the Massachusetts situation where there is no case, there is no Massachusetts case? So what is the court supposed to do? Now, in -- this Court has said it's -- it's as simple as pie to determine whether something is -- is an element or a means. That's your view, too. But just tell me what the -- what the Federal sentencing court would do in that situation. Which will often be the case. So what -- what happens if there is that State case that says whether this is definitively an element or a means? Well, suppose they -- suppose they don't. So if it looks at a case like Massachusetts, what's the Federal sentencing court supposed to do? Why is that correct, Mr. Fleming? That depends on State pleading law. Are you -- are you telling us that in every State, if something is a -- if you have a category of means, it is impermissible for the charging indictment, whether it's an indictment or an information, to specify the thing that was done, it has to be done in terms of the elements of the statute? You're going to tell us that that is State pleading law in every jurisdiction? Well, then how can you tell from the -- from the charging document that something is an element or a means? What if the charge is one? What if -- in this case, what if the charge -- what if the charging document just charged one? Does that make it an element? What is -- what is the evidence in -- in the -- you said the statutory text. What is the evidence in the statutory text of ACCA that this is what Congress intended? Prior to Apprendi and all this other stuff. What is the statutory evidence? So if someone were explaining what -- what your client pled guilty to, they wouldn't say he was convicted for -- for breaking into a garage? They wouldn't say that? You're seriously arguing that -- you're seriously arguing that all of the States will or should go back and reformulate their burglary statutes so as -- -- to make the conviction? Well, that's what you just said. So if they want them to count as ACCA predicates, no problem. They can just go back and change their burglary statutes. What do you make of the fact that until this case, the Court has never analyzed whether something was an element or a means? Well, you said this has been established for 25 years and the Court has used the term element, element, element, but has it ever before gone into the question of whether what it was talking about in that particular case was in the technical sense, either an element or a means? ",well there be a lot of reason why iowa might want to take the approach that it that it do suppose the person be convict suppose the evidence involve the burglary of a trailer so you would have the rather ridiculous situation of a jury if that be if those be separate element then if six of the juror think well this trailer be not very movable so i think it be a house and the other others say well you know it be possible you could hook it up to a truck and move it so it be a vehicle so there could not be an agreement and the defendant would be acquit that be a rather strange result that the iowa legislature might want to avoid but you want to attribute the same you want to you want to say the massachusetts legislature in the case of a houseboat would permit the same thing you have no massachusetts case that say that well maybe they have more houseboat in massachusetts than they do in vermont laughter well the point be what be the federal under your approach what be the federal sentencing court suppose to do in the situation like the massachusetts situation where there be no case there be no massachusetts case so what be the court suppose to do now in this court have say it be it be as simple as pie to determine whether something be be an element or a mean that be your view too but just tell me what the what the federal sentencing court would do in that situation which will often be the case so what what happen if there be that state case that say whether this be definitively an element or a mean well suppose they suppose they do not so if it look at a case like massachusetts what be the federal sentencing court suppose to do why be that correct mr fleming that depend on state pleading law be you be you tell us that in every state if something be a if you have a category of mean it be impermissible for the charging indictment whether it be an indictment or an information to specify the thing that be do it have to be do in term of the element of the statute you be go to tell us that that be state plead law in every jurisdiction well then how can you tell from the from the charge document that something be an element or a mean what if the charge be one what if in this case what if the charge what if the charge document just charge one do that make it an element what be what be the evidence in in the you say the statutory text what be the evidence in the statutory text of acca that this be what congress intend prior to apprendi and all this other stuff what be the statutory evidence so if someone we be explain what what your client plead guilty to they would not say he be convict for for break into a garage they would not say that you be seriously argue that you be seriously argue that all of the state will or should go back and reformulate their burglary statute so as to make the conviction well that be what you just say so if they want them to count as acca predicate no problem they can just go back and change their burglary statute what do you make of the fact that until this case the court have never analyze whether something be an element or a mean well you say this have be establish for year and the court have use the term element element element but have it ever before go into the question of whether what it be talk about in that particular case be in the technical sense either an element or a mean ,211.79999999999995,Roberts Court,"Apr 26, 2016",Richard Mathis,United States,15-6092,"Jan 19, 2016","Jun 23, 2016",112,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

2015,Voisine v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","But the mens rea of recklessness could apply to the act of touching or to whether the act is offensive. Now, under Maine law, to which of those does it apply? It doesn't necessarily have to apply to both. So if someone recklessly touches another person and that is offensive, that's a battery under Maine law? And what happened in that case? No, I mean what were the facts? What did this person do that was -- involved a reckless touching? Well, that -- that seems like the recklessness there goes to the -- the offensive nature of the touching, not to the touching itself. In other words, there's the act of touching, so he -- he went to shake her but he didn't intend to touch her? I don't really understand the -- the answer. He didn't intend to touch her at all? That was his intent? Okay. Well, that's what I'm saying. They are two different things. Did the -- does the person intend to touch -- does the person intend to touch in an offensive way? And so then it seems like your answer to my question is that it is in the latter that has the mens rea of recklessness. Do you think that prosecutors, when they are State prosecutors, when they are charging these domestic violence offenses, are going to be looking ahead to the consequences of the particular charge for Federal firearms laws? Do you think that's realistic? Well, let me ask you this, which is somewhat unrelated. So Congress passes this statute, and they do not want a person who has been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence to have a firearm. Okay? What was the year when that was passed? Okay. 1996. That's what they want to do. And you agree that a -- that the offense of battery falls within that definition; am I right? All right. What reason is there to think that when Congress did this, they wanted common law battery only? They didn't want battery as it is defined in general by a great many States. At -- at that time, am I not -- is it not correct that by that time a majority of the States had battery offenses that reached reckless conduct? Well, I under -- I understand that, but I thought you agree that ""battery"" in some sense falls within the definite -- falls within the category of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. Yeah. Okay. Well, if you agree with that -- and then your argument is that they just -- all they think about across the street is the common law. So battery -- common law battery, they don't care what the actual statutes are around the country. They are just interested in the offense of common law battery. I mean, is that realistic? I think you're losing me. I thought you were argue -- I thought you were acknowledging that reckless conduct would be sufficient when it is -- when physical injury as opposed to offensive touching is involved; is that right or not? ",but the men rea of recklessness could apply to the act of touch or to whether the act be offensive now under maine law to which of those do it apply it do not necessarily have to apply to both so if someone recklessly touch another person and that be offensive that be a battery under maine law and what happen in that case no i mean what we be the fact what do this person do that be involve a reckless touching well that that seem like the recklessness there go to the the offensive nature of the touching not to the touch itself in other word there be the act of touching so he he go to shake her but he do not intend to touch her i do not really understand the the answer he do not intend to touch her at all that be his intent okay well that be what I be say they be two different thing do the do the person intend to touch do the person intend to touch in an offensive way and so then it seem like your answer to my question be that it be in the latter that have the men rea of recklessness do you think that prosecutor when they be state prosecutor when they be charge these domestic violence offense be go to be look ahead to the consequence of the particular charge for federal firearm law do you think that be realistic well let me ask you this which be somewhat unrelated so congress pass this statute and they do not want a person who have be convict of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence to have a firearm okay what be the year when that be pass okay that be what they want to do and you agree that a that the offense of battery fall within that definition be i right all right what reason be there to think that when congress do this they want common law battery only they do not want battery as it be define in general by a great many state at at that time be i not be it not correct that by that time a majority of the state have battery offense that reach reckless conduct well i under i understand that but i think you agree that battery in some sense fall within the definite fall within the category of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence yeah okay well if you agree with that and then your argument be that they just all they think about across the street be the common law so battery common law battery they do not care what the actual statute be around the country they be just interested in the offense of common law battery i mean be that realistic i think you be lose me i think you we be argue i think you we be acknowledge that reckless conduct would be sufficient when it be when physical injury as oppose to offensive touching be involve be that right or not ,183.10000000000005,Roberts Court,"Feb 29, 2016","Stephen Voisine, et al.",United States,14-10154,"Oct 30, 2015","Jun 27, 2016",112,0.0,1.0,0.0,0

But trial judges do hundreds of things that are not expressly authorized by rule. So what -- we -- we certainly couldn't adopt that rule, a Federal judge -- a trial judge can't do anything unless there's a rule that says the judge can't -- can do it. Trials would come to an end. The other is based on the common law. But there were all sorts of common law procedures, and procedures that continued into the 19th century, that have been abandoned in modern practice. So you want us to say if there was a -- an established practice at common law, and into the -- maybe the late 19th century.

2015,Sturgeon v. Frost,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","What was the basis for Ninth Circuit's decision? Was it limited to navigable waters? What was the basis for the decision? Well, before you get to that, could we begin with what the Ninth Circuit decided? You're entitled to defend the judgment on any ground that you like, but -- that was presented below, but the only issue we have to -- we have to reach is the correctness of the Ninth Circuit's decision. Now, I understand what the Ninth Circuit to have held, to be this, that the hovercraft rule is not barred by the second sentence of Section 103(c) of ANILCA, because the hovercraft rule does not apply only in Alaska, because it applies throughout the country. Is that -- that's a correct understanding of what they held? Well, no. I want to -- I understand the -- the holding -- and I -- I stand ready to be corrected -- to be what I stated: That the hovercraft rule is not barred because it isn't Alaska-specific. And, I mean, you filed a 58-page brief and, as I read it, you didn't get to the reason that the Ninth Circuit based its decision on until page 49, and you devoted exactly a paragraph to it. And why don't you concede that it's wrong? It's a ridiculous interpretation, is it not? (Laughter.) Well, you -- you want to talk about waters, and -- and after this question I won't say anything more on this, but is the Ninth Circuit's holding limited to waters? The -- the State of Alaska on page 20 and 21 of their brief cite a notice in the Federal Register by the Park Service in which they defend the regulation of nonfederal oil and gas activities on the basis of Sturgeon, on the ground that Section 103(c) of ANILCA applies only to Alaska-specific regulations. And since these are not Alaska-specific, those -- those regulations apply. So they understand it to apply to something more than just navigable waters. It's solely to apply to Alaska -- -- within such unit? Solely to apply to nonpublic units to lands in Alaska. What can you do about why this provision that you -- you reproduce on 7a gets around the first section of 103(c)? This -- that provision allows regulation of waters within Service units, but the first section, as I read it, says that nonpublic land within the boundaries of -- of a CSU is not part of the CSU. Let's say that part of a river is within a CSU. And do you read this statute to mean that the --the Park Service could regulate boating 500 miles downstream from that part of the -- on that river, because it's relating to waters that are within the CSU? So if there's a rule that applies to conservation -- it applies to Alaska, and it applies to the National Mall, that would be that you can't have a Hovercraft in Alaska or in the title basin. Under the Ninth Circuit's -- the Ninth Circuit's rationale, that would be 107 -- 103 -- 103(c) wouldn't buy that. ",what be the basis for ninth circuit s decision be it limit to navigable water what be the basis for the decision well before you get to that could we begin with what the ninth circuit decide you be entitle to defend the judgment on any ground that you like but that be present below but the only issue we have to we have to reach be the correctness of the ninth circuit s decision now i understand what the ninth circuit to have hold to be this that the hovercraft rule be not bar by the second sentence of section c of anilca because the hovercraft rule do not apply only in alaska because it apply throughout the country be that that be a correct understanding of what they hold well no i want to i understand the the holding and i i stand ready to be correct to be what i state that the hovercraft rule be not bar because it be not alaska specific and i mean you file a page brief and as i read it you do not get to the reason that the ninth circuit base its decision on until page and you devote exactly a paragraph to it and why do not you concede that it be wrong it be a ridiculous interpretation be it not laughter well you you want to talk about water and and after this question i will not say anything more on this but be the ninth circuit s hold limited to water the the state of alaska on page and of their brief cite a notice in the federal register by the park service in which they defend the regulation of nonfederal oil and gas activity on the basis of sturgeon on the ground that section c of anilca applies only to alaska specific regulation and since these be not alaska specific those those regulation apply so they understand it to apply to something more than just navigable water it be solely to apply to alaska within such unit solely to apply to nonpublic unit to land in alaska what can you do about why this provision that you you reproduce on a get around the first section of c this that provision allow regulation of water within service unit but the first section as i read it say that nonpublic land within the boundary of of a csu be not part of the csu let us say that part of a river be within a csu and do you read this statute to mean that the the park service could regulate boat mile downstream from that part of the on that river because it be relate to water that be within the csu so if there be a rule that apply to conservation it apply to alaska and it apply to the national mall that would be that you can not have a hovercraft in alaska or in the title basin under the ninth circuit s the ninth circuit s rationale that would be c would not buy that ,197.87,Roberts Court,"Jan 20, 2016",John Sturgeon,Bert Frost,14-1209,"Oct 1, 2015","Mar 22, 2016",112,1.0,1.0,0.0,1

As I understand your argument, this provision would apply to sexual abuse involving a minor and also abusive sexual conduct involving a minor. Is there any difference between those two things? So why did Congress put them both in? Well, there's something that jumps out. It's a strange list, aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse. Sexual abuse would include aggravated sexual abuse. So that seems to be -- the reference to aggravated sexual abuse seems to be redundant. And abusive sexual conduct, if understood in ordinary -- in the terms of ordinary language, does seem to duplicate sexual abuse. But there's an explanation that jumps out, and that is that this -- almost this precise terminology appears in Sections 2241, 2242, and 2243. And in those provisions, all those terms are defined so that they mean something different. So it seems to jump out at the reader that that's what Congress was doing in this list. Why is -- what is wrong with that? Well, it could have done it more clearly. That's certainly the answer to this whole case. They could have handled this issue a lot more clearly. But that is the -- the idea that they were picking up the definitions in the Federal provisions is one explanation for this rather -- this list. The other makes the list terribly redundant, and I haven't heard your explanation as to why they would do that. Why include both sexual abuse and aggravated sexual abuse? Why include sexual abuse and abusive sexual conduct? But your -- your argument is that it is just a coincidence that Congress came up with this list of three terms that are redundant and that just so happen to be almost exactly the same three terms in the same order that appear in the Federal provisions. But they used -- they used -- When they use ""sexual abuse"" and ""sexually abusive conduct,"" they were not -- they -- they had in mind the Federal provisions, but they didn't want those terms in this provision to mean the same thing as they mean in the Federal provision, even though, according to you, there is no generally accepted understanding of the difference between sexual abuse and abusive sexual conduct. Sexual abuse is defined, and abusive sexual contact is defined, are they not? Why do you resist -- why -- why do you resist the argument that what Congress was doing was picking up basically the definitions of the Federal offenses that are worded almost identically? If that's what they are doing, then it's understandable what is meant by all three terms. If that's not what they were doing, it's a strange coincidence. And not only is there redundancy, but there's ambiguity about what is meant by sexual abuse as opposed to abusive sexual conduct, and why they had to put in aggravated sexual abuse in addition to sexual abuse. Yes, they could have done it more clearly, of course. The -- the statute is -- is poorly drafted. You know, we give them a ""D"" for their drafting of this statute. But what is the difference between sexual abuse and abusive sexual conduct? Putting aside the definitions of those -- of those terms or similar terms in Chapter 109. So why did they put -- why did they do that? Just catchy phrases that came to their mind? I don't think I actually said anything about the rule of lenity. Well, you -- you are making an argument that an awful lot of this big book is -- is subject to the rule of lenity because a lot of it is very poorly drafted. Let's take a -- an offense as to which there isn't much ambiguity: Rape. All right? Under the -- the ordinary meaning, why would rape in a Federal enclave qualify; rape a few yards away, perhaps, in State territory, not -- not qualify? ",well there be another possible explanation for that because the last item in the list itself involve a great many itself involve a list so the second or could be a substitute for a semicolon but let me ask you another question about the language that you just read as i understand your argument this provision would apply to sexual abuse involve a minor and also abusive sexual conduct involve a minor be there any difference between those two thing so why do congress put them both in well there be something that jump out it be a strange list aggravate sexual abuse sexual abuse sexual abuse would include aggravated sexual abuse so that seem to be the reference to aggravate sexual abuse seem to be redundant and abusive sexual conduct if understand in ordinary in the term of ordinary language do seem to duplicate sexual abuse but there be an explanation that jump out and that be that this almost this precise terminology appear in section and and in those provision all those term be define so that they mean something different so it seem to jump out at the reader that that be what congress be do in this list why be what be wrong with that well it could have do it more clearly that be certainly the answer to this whole case they could have handle this issue a lot more clearly but that be the the idea that they we be pick up the definition in the federal provision be one explanation for this rather this list the other make the list terribly redundant and i have not hear your explanation as to why they would do that why include both sexual abuse and aggravate sexual abuse why include sexual abuse and abusive sexual conduct but your your argument be that it be just a coincidence that congress come up with this list of three term that be redundant and that just so happen to be almost exactly the same three term in the same order that appear in the federal provision but they use they use when they use sexual abuse and sexually abusive conduct they we be not they they have in mind the federal provision but they do not want those term in this provision to mean the same thing as they mean in the federal provision even though accord to you there be no generally accept understanding of the difference between sexual abuse and abusive sexual conduct sexual abuse be define and abusive sexual contact be define be they not why do you resist why why do you resist the argument that what congress be do be pick up basically the definition of the federal offense that be word almost identically if that be what they be do then it be understandable what be mean by all three term if that be not what they we be do it be a strange coincidence and not only be there redundancy but there be ambiguity about what be mean by sexual abuse as oppose to abusive sexual conduct and why they have to put in aggravated sexual abuse in addition to sexual abuse yes they could have do it more clearly of course the the statute be be poorly draft you know we give them a d for their drafting of this statute but what be the difference between sexual abuse and abusive sexual conduct put aside the definition of those of those term or similar term in chapter so why do they put why do they do that just catchy phrase that come to their mind i do not think i actually say anything about the rule of lenity well you you be make an argument that an awful lot of this big book be be subject to the rule of lenity because a lot of it be very poorly draft let us take a an offense as to which there be not much ambiguity rape all right under the the ordinary meaning why would rape in a federal enclave qualify rape a few yard away perhaps in state territory not not qualify ,273.40000000000003,Roberts Court,"Nov 3, 2015",Avondale Lockhart,United States,14-8358,"May 26, 2015","Mar 1, 2016",112,0.0,1.0,0.0,0

If this immunity is analogous, for example, to absolute -- a category of absolute immunity for a government official or qualified immunity for a government official, those are also immunities from suit; and therefore, under the collateral-order doctrine, an adverse ruling could be appealed. Well, no. Because you could test -- you could determine jurisdiction under the Bell v. Hood standard, and then you can move to dismiss the complaint under 12(b)(6) And if you're unsuccessful, you could take appeal under the collateral-order doctrine. Why doesn't that serve interest just as well, without producing some of the unfortunate -- arguably unfortunate collateral consequences of labeling this as jurisdictional, among which is the fact that this Court would have to decide all sorts of questions even if they are not contested by the parties? But what is the basis for that? They're just -- you may waive immunity, but is there a statutory provision that supports what you just said? And what does it say? Would it be -- would it be meaningful to say that when a Bivens action is filed with jurisdiction predicated on the arising under statute, a constitutional right is in issue? Well, this is a curious argument for you to be raising, because your prime -- your lead argument is that the text indisputably supports your position, is it not? You just -- you just said we shouldn't pay that much attention to what the text says. The basis of that, what do you think you would have to prove? That property was taken on the merits, property was taken in violation of a customary international law standard, or that having established that as the jurisdictional predicate, that there was a conversion under the law of whatever jurisdiction is chosen?

What you've just said takes the word ""equal"" out of the standard. Isn't that -- Well, I understand what an equal outcome would be, but I don't understand what an equal opportunity means when an equal outcome is not practical. Do you agree with Mr. Fisher that cost has no place in this calculation? No matter how expensive it would be and no matter what the impact in, let's say, a poor school district would be on the general student population, cost can't be considered? And do you think in the real world, school boards are disregarding costs entirely? Do you -- do you know what percentage of the funds that are spent by school districts for this program are paid by the Federal government? Federal government pays 15 percent? What is frustrating about this case and about this statute is that we have a blizzard of words. And if you -- -- read them literally, it's not clear to me that they mean anything different. Now, ""progress"" benefit. Yeah, I don't see how you can have a benefit unless you're making some progress. ""Significant,"" ""meaningful,"" they're synonyms. If something is significant or meaningful, it's more than de minimis. And if it's more than de minimis, you could say it's significant. It's something that you note. So it's really -- I mean, what everybody seems to be looking for is the word that has just the right nuance to express this thought. What is the difference between ""some benefit"" and ""significant""? And what I'm -- We're going to have to use musical notation to -- and not just words -- to express the -- the idea that seems to be emerging. All right. Would you say -- I'll ask the same thing of Mr. Fisher if he has a chance to address it. If -- if we were to look at what the lower courts have been doing -- we don't see very many of these cases, the lower courts see a lot of them. If we looked at what they have been doing in general, would you say that they are doing -- that they are applying the statute appropriately and consistent with correct interpretation? That sounds very harsh. What's the origin of this phrase, ""more than de minimis""? Who thought this up? I know where ""de minimis"" comes from. (Laughter.)

And I would appreciate it if you would respond to one of the arguments Ms. Sullivan made toward the end, which is that if we issue an opinion that affirms in this case where there were -- which involves the type -- the greatest degree of bad faith in this -- in violating the seal requirement that is really possible to imagine, that will stand for the principal in future cases, that even if an instance in which there was complete bad faith, dismissal is not appropriate. Or a dismissal is -- can -- can properly be rejected. But parties are usually held accountable for the actions of their attorneys. Well, what do you make of the -- how much weight do you think should be given to the fact that the government doesn't think that dismissal is appropriate in this situation? What -- what -- does the statute say that the complaint shall be filed under seal and shall be main -- maintained under seal unless the government waives that? On the issue of harm to the government, did I understand you to say that the question is actual harm and not likelihood of harm at the time of the disclosure? ",well you have two argument one be that dismissal be mandatory the other be that the district court and the court of appeal apply the wrong standard in determine not to dismiss here as to the first what would you say about the case where the disclosure be very limited see by only one person let us say it be inadvertent it be not do in bad faith and it cause no harm you would say dismissal be require even under those circumstance but that do not that do not sound like a per se rule then well if we issue an opinion when we issue an opinion in this case it will change the legal landscape and i would appreciate it if you would respond to one of the argument ms sullivan make toward the end which be that if we issue an opinion that affirm in this case where there we be which involve the type the great degree of bad faith in this in violate the seal requirement that be really possible to imagine that will stand for the principal in future case that even if an instance in which there be complete bad faith dismissal be not appropriate or a dismissal be can can properly be reject but party be usually hold accountable for the action of their attorney well what do you make of the how much weight do you think should be give to the fact that the government do not think that dismissal be appropriate in this situation what what do the statute say that the complaint shall be file under seal and shall be main maintain under seal unless the government waive that on the issue of harm to the government do i understand you to say that the question be actual harm and not likelihood of harm at the time of the disclosure ,118.57,Roberts Court,"Nov 1, 2016",State Farm Fire and Casualty Co.,"United States ex rel.

2016,Lewis v. Clarke,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","When -- when there is a suit against an entity like the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the question is whether that is really a -- a suit -- whether that is a suit against one of the states and, therefore, subject to sovereign immunity, we would look to see who would pay the judgment. So that's Mr. Katyal's argument. Why wouldn't we do the same -- why should we not do the same thing when it is against an employee? Could a State give greater immunity to an Indian tribe than is available under Federal law? So the Connecticut supreme court could do that if it wanted to? So you think it was waived. Was that argument? Waived. Now, on the facts of this case, is there any argument in favor of official immunity? Mr. Clarke is not a member of the tribe. He's driving a limo on I-95 transporting gamblers and he rear-ends Mr. Lewis, who is not a member of the tribe. You think there's any argument in favor of sovereign immunity for Mr. Clarke under the facts of this case? Well, what would happen in all the 1983 actions or all the Bivens actions if there was an agreement by the government employee -- employer to indemnify the individual? The problem -- the problem with that argument is that it -- it seems to suggest that the State's motive will be to provide protection for somebody like Mr. Clarke. But the State of Connecticut has a very strong incentive to -- to be solicitous of the interests of the Mohegan tribe because the State gets an enormous amount of revenue from this casino. Isn't that true? Why should -- why should a -- a tribal employee driving a limo be entitled to official immunity? You say that the purpose of official immunity is to protect, quote, ""the fearless, vigorous, and effective administration of policies of government,"" but you -- you want to have -- you want to encourage limo drivers on I-95 to be fearless in the way they drive? ",when when there be a suit against an entity like the port authority of new york and new jersey and the question be whether that be really a a suit whether that be a suit against one of the state and therefore subject to sovereign immunity we would look to see who would pay the judgment so that be mr katyal s argument why would not we do the same why should we not do the same thing when it be against an employee could a state give great immunity to an indian tribe than be available under federal law so the connecticut supreme court could do that if it want to so you think it be waive be that argument waive now on the fact of this case be there any argument in favor of official immunity mr clarke be not a member of the tribe he be drive a limo on i transport gambler and he rear end mr lewis who be not a member of the tribe you think there be any argument in favor of sovereign immunity for mr clarke under the fact of this case well what would happen in all the action or all the bivens action if there be an agreement by the government employee employer to indemnify the individual the problem the problem with that argument be that it it seem to suggest that the state s motive will be to provide protection for somebody like mr clarke but the state of connecticut have a very strong incentive to to be solicitous of the interest of the mohegan tribe because the state get an enormous amount of revenue from this casino be not that true why should why should a a tribal employee drive a limo be entitle to official immunity you say that the purpose of official immunity be to protect quote the fearless vigorous and effective administration of policy of government but you you want to have you want to encourage limo driver on i to be fearless in the way they drive ,132.42000000000002,Roberts Court,"Jan 9, 2017","Brian Lewis, et al.",William Clark,15-1500,"Sep 29, 2016","Apr 25, 2017",112,1.0,1.0,0.0,1
2016,Moore v. Texas,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, let me ask you -- let me ask you the same question in -- in different terms, and you can tell me that -- whether this is not a fair paraphrase of your question. And I -- if you can give me a yes-or-no answer to this question, I'd appreciate it. Under Hall and Atkins, must a State use current medical standards, for example, DSM-5, as opposed to older standards, for example, DSM-IV? Yes or no. Then I don't know -- -- how you can recover on the question -- you can prevail on the question that you presented to us. Well, I don't understand what you mean by ""prohibit."" You mean prohibit the -- the lower courts from using a standard different from the one that the court of criminal appeals has said is the standard that has to be used everywhere in Texas? So each -- each trial level judge would apply a different standard, whatever that judge thinks is the right one? And you think that this is a question of trial court discretion? A trial court has the discretion to use the newer standards as opposed to the -- as opposed to the standards that the court of criminal appeals says are the appropriate ones? As opposed to the ones that the court of criminal appeals had itself adopted. Mr. Sloan, I don't think you finished answering my question. There are two -- let me rephrase it this way: There are different things in the Briseno or Briseno opinion. One is the -- the medical standards that are taken from the medical publications that were current as of the time of that decision. And then there are these additional considerations, and that's what's regarded as the Briseno factors. But if you -- let's take a -- disregard the latter. The first part are current -- are medical standards that were current at that time, are they not? Well, I think the court's -- would you say something about the adaptive behavior? Because I think that may be a stronger leg. But what was the -- what is the problem with their analysis of that point? Okay. On that one, is there a consensus in the medical community that that's improper? Well, here is an article written by a number of experts, recent article from the Journal of American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law, Assessing Adaptive Functioning in Death Penalty Cases after Hall and DSM-5. One of these experts was cited in the -- in -- in one of the supporting amicus briefs by professional organizations in Hall, which says that any assessment of adaptive functioning must give sufficient consideration to assets and deficits alike. So what -- what do you make of that? That these are just -- these are -- are these quacks? This is Dr. Hagan, Drogin, and Guilmette. If the professional organizations by, I suppose, a majority vote or something like that conclude one thing, and but there are respected experts who disagree, you're saying the State is obligated -- -- as a matter of constitutional law to follow the organizations? Well, General, we are not reviewing Sosa. Could I ask a question about what the court did in this case? Now, on pages 62a and 63a of the petition, the appendix to the petition, it sets out the three factors, and then it discusses those at length, and then on page 89, it says, in addition, our consideration of the Briseno evidentiary factors weighs heavily against the findings. So is it clear that these evidentiary factors actually played an indispensable role in the decision in this case, which is what we were reviewing? Could you just clarify what you said about DSM-IV and DSM-5, because I had a different impression from your initial argument. So if we were to say today every State must adopt DSM-5, and then at some point in the future DSM-6 comes out, would it be your position that those States would all have to go back and reconsider what they're doing? ",well let me ask you let me ask you the same question in in different term and you can tell me that whether this be not a fair paraphrase of your question and i if you can give me a yes or no answer to this question I would appreciate it under hall and atkins must a state use current medical standard for example dsm as oppose to old standard for example dsm iv yes or no then i do not know how you can recover on the question you can prevail on the question that you present to us well i do not understand what you mean by prohibit you mean prohibit the the low court from use a standard different from the one that the court of criminal appeal have say be the standard that have to be use everywhere in texas so each each trial level judge would apply a different standard whatever that judge think be the right one and you think that this be a question of trial court discretion a trial court have the discretion to use the newer standard as oppose to the as oppose to the standard that the court of criminal appeal say be the appropriate one as oppose to the one that the court of criminal appeal have itself adopt mr sloan i do not think you finish answer my question there be two let me rephrase it this way there be different thing in the briseno or briseno opinion one be the the medical standard that be take from the medical publication that we be current as of the time of that decision and then there be these additional consideration and that be what be regard as the briseno factor but if you let us take a disregard the latter the first part be current be medical standard that we be current at that time be they not well i think the court s would you say something about the adaptive behavior because i think that may be a strong leg but what be the what be the problem with their analysis of that point okay on that one be there a consensus in the medical community that that be improper well here be an article write by a number of expert recent article from the journal of american academy of psychiatry and the law assess adaptive functioning in death penalty case after hall and dsm one of these expert be cite in the in in one of the support amicus brief by professional organization in hall which say that any assessment of adaptive functioning must give sufficient consideration to asset and deficit alike so what what do you make of that that these be just these be be these quack this be dr hagan drogin and guilmette if the professional organization by i suppose a majority vote or something like that conclude one thing and but there be respect expert who disagree you be say the state be obligate as a matter of constitutional law to follow the organization well general we be not review sosa could i ask a question about what the court do in this case now on page a and a of the petition the appendix to the petition it set out the three factor and then it discuss those at length and then on page it say in addition our consideration of the briseno evidentiary factor weigh heavily against the finding so be it clear that these evidentiary factor actually play an indispensable role in the decision in this case which be what we we be review could you just clarify what you say about dsm iv and dsm because i have a different impression from your initial argument so if we we be to say today every state must adopt dsm and then at some point in the future dsm come out would it be your position that those state would all have to go back and reconsider what they be do ,246.71,Roberts Court,"Nov 29, 2016",Bobby James Moore,Texas,15-797,"Jun 6, 2016","Mar 28, 2017",112,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2016,"Henson v. Santander Consumer USA, Inc.",112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","And I don't see a problem with -- with (F)(iii) The -- the party is attempting to collect a debt owed or due to someone else, and it concerns a debt which was obtained. And -- and if obtained, it doesn't mean owed. You can obtain a debt that you don't own. I don't see any problem with (F)(iii). Why would they not be covered if they acquired the debt before it went into -- I'm sorry -- after it went into default? They would be collecting a debt owed -- owed or due to someone else. And they acquired the debt after it went into default; therefore, they don't fall into (iii). Why do you have to get into assignments at all? All -- all that's needed to defeat your argument with respect to (iii), is to think of a situation in which a person or an entity is collecting a debt owed to another, and that person or entity obtained the debt at a time when the debt was not defaulted. And that -- it's very easy to think of a situation like that, with respect to the classic debt collector that does nothing but collect other people's debts, if ""obtained"" means getting that debt for collection. Your -- your answer is that's not a reasonable -- that's not the right definition of ""obtained."" So that's what it comes down to, right? No, I'm talking -- I'll take them one at a time. All right. As to Clause (iv), I'm not sure I understood what you said. So let's say your company is owed a debt by other -- to -- other people owe the company a debt. They get a loan. They give the -- the party extending the loan a security interest in that debt, and now there's an effort to collect that debt. Who is owed that debt? Is not -- is it not still owed to the -- the original party? It's not owed to the person with the security interest, is it? Yes. Right. Well, this situation -- I -- I mean, it's possible to think of situations that would fall within that. It may be that they are not things that are -- they are not situations that are very likely to come up in -- in the real world. But the strength of your -- the -- the degree of absurdity that you have to show under (iv), depends on the ambiguity of the phrase due -- ""owed or due,"" and I mean, I think that's not just -- not the first way you'd read that. It's not the fiftieth way you would read that. It's just you're -- you're fighting -- you're really going uphill on that. You need something really strong to overcome that, I would say.

2016,Nelson v. Colorado,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","I thought your argument was -- was this, but what you're saying now and a lot of your brief is much more complicated, but the simple argument I thought was this: This was your client's money. It's a certain amount of dollars. Okay. It was taken away from them as a result of a trial that was flawed and therefore they were deprived of that property without due process of law. I thought that was the argument. Am I right or not? Okay. Now, if that is the argument, there are two complications that I see in your briefing. One is that you concede that they could be denied restitution for equitable reasons. Let's just take that. Where -- where else in the law of due process would something like that come up? The other complication that I see in this make-whole argument, in other words, the State took things away from you, they took property away from you, and when the conviction is reversed, they have to restore you to the position you were in before the prosecution. Is this, the -- the restitution and all of these fees are small in comparison with the main thing that was taken away, and that was -- that was liberty. So if your argument is correct, why shouldn't this -- what -- did -- didn't the State -- the State took away your clients' liberty without due process of law, so would they be automatically entitled to be made whole in that respect? Why not? Well, if tradition -- I mean, if tradition like that can defeat the argument for compensation for time wrongfully spent in prison, then can tradition defeat the argument that you make with respect to the fees and the restitution? Oh, okay. So the argument is tradition could do it if there were such a thing. But we have to look at the tradition. Well, then your -- I think your argument has moved from the simple one I started out with, which is that you're absolutely entitled to be made whole, to the argument that they have to provide -- that we look to tradition and we have -- we have to see what sort of tradition is adequate. So what would be an adequate procedure here? So what is that process after the conviction is reversed? Well, is that true? I mean, I still don't understand the difference between the simple argument that you're required to be made whole and the argument that a court could deny restitution based on equitable considerations as this court has said. So which is your argument? You automatically get it back; that's the end of it. You don't -- no procedure is necessary -- -- or that you could be denied receiving the money back for equitable reasons? Well, what if the State says that you -- that the defendant has the obligation to move for a stay of the judgment of restitution when the defendant takes an appeal, and if the defendant doesn't do that, then the money is not refunded? But your argument is that if -- let's say there's a very substantial judgment of restitution and the money is paid to the victims. Let's say they're victims like the ones in this case, so it's -- it's therapy -- -- for abuse. And then even after the judgment has become final, if there is -- if -- if the defendant is given relief on collateral review, the State would have to -- would have to compensate the defendant for all the money that was paid to the victims. That's your argument? Why does it -- why does it matter who owns this money at this time under Colorado law? This was the defendants' money and it was taken away from them. So if -- at -- you say that at some point it ceased to be their money and it became the state's money. But then you have to show that it was taken away pursuant to due process, and consistent with due process. Well, how can the conviction -- how -- how can the conviction have been reversed if -- if they were convicted consistent with due process? ",i think your argument be be this but what you be say now and a lot of your brief be much more complicated but the simple argument i think be this this be your client s money it be a certain amount of dollar okay it be take away from them as a result of a trial that be flaw and therefore they we be deprive of that property without due process of law i think that be the argument be i right or not okay now if that be the argument there be two complication that i see in your briefing one be that you concede that they could be deny restitution for equitable reason let us just take that where where else in the law of due process would something like that come up the other complication that i see in this make whole argument in other word the state take thing away from you they take property away from you and when the conviction be reverse they have to restore you to the position you we be in before the prosecution be this the the restitution and all of these fee be small in comparison with the main thing that be take away and that be that be liberty so if your argument be correct why should not this what do do not the state the state take away your client liberty without due process of law so would they be automatically entitle to be make whole in that respect why not well if tradition i mean if tradition like that can defeat the argument for compensation for time wrongfully spend in prison then can tradition defeat the argument that you make with respect to the fee and the restitution oh okay so the argument be tradition could do it if there we be such a thing but we have to look at the tradition well then your i think your argument have move from the simple one i start out with which be that you be absolutely entitle to be make whole to the argument that they have to provide that we look to tradition and we have we have to see what sort of tradition be adequate so what would be an adequate procedure here so what be that process after the conviction be reverse well be that true i mean i still do not understand the difference between the simple argument that you be require to be make whole and the argument that a court could deny restitution base on equitable consideration as this court have say so which be your argument you automatically get it back that be the end of it you do not no procedure be necessary or that you could be deny receive the money back for equitable reason well what if the state say that you that the defendant have the obligation to move for a stay of the judgment of restitution when the defendant take an appeal and if the defendant do not do that then the money be not refund but your argument be that if let us say there be a very substantial judgment of restitution and the money be pay to the victim let us say they be victim like the one in this case so it be it be therapy for abuse and then even after the judgment have become final if there be if if the defendant be give relief on collateral review the state would have to would have to compensate the defendant for all the money that be pay to the victim that be your argument why do it why do it matter who own this money at this time under colorado law this be the defendant money and it be take away from them so if at you say that at some point it cease to be their money and it become the state s money but then you have to show that it be take away pursuant to due process and consistent with due process well how can the conviction how how can the conviction have be reverse if if they we be convict consistent with due process ,251.06,Roberts Court,"Jan 9, 2017",Shannon Nelson and Louis Alonzo Madden,Colorado,15-1256,"Sep 29, 2016","Apr 19, 2017",112,1.0,1.0,1.0,1

Suppose it was -- -- in the District of Columbia. But you think that even as narrowly tailored as Justice Ginsburg's example, so it would be a crime for a convicted sex offender -- or let's say someone who was convicted previously of committing a sex offense using the Internet from contacting on the Internet a person who is known -- known by that person to be a minor without the consent of the parents of the minor? That would be a violation of the First Amendment? Oh, I thought you said it wouldn't be. Yeah, the -- the interpretation that Justice Breyer -- the -- the language that Justice Breyer is referring to and other language in this statute, I think, could, for the purpose of avoiding First Amendment problems, be limited to core social networking sites, including Facebook and things like Facebook, Google Plus, that sort of thing, and excluding a lot of the other sites that the electronic frontier says are included, like the New York Times and Betty Crocker and things like that. So it would be limited just to social networking sites. Would you agree that it could be read at -- using constitutional avoidance, it could be narrowed to at least those? Well, just to put it in -- in context. It -- it is important for purposes of an as-applied challenge because if -- what your -- what your client used was a social -- was Facebook, right? Okay. Even if it were limited to -- to those -- You would say it's unconstitutional. Well, you know, you might read this to -- you might read a personal profile to mean something more than just a nickname.

Why don't you read it that way? And if you read it that way, would it include nytimes.com? Well, I'm saying suppose we think that -- that it's a stretch to get to links, but it does require a personal profile, and I wouldn't think that just a nickname. Somebody says my nickname is, I don't know what, Joe, that that's a -- that's a profile? Well, suppose this case had come to us in 2003, before Facebook was created. Would there be alternative channels then? But -- But what I'm asking is whether the existence of alternative channels asks whether these are channels that people like to use or whether if the channels that are affected by the statute are taken away, there are still alternative channels. Now, I know there are people who think that life is not possible without Twitter and Facebook and these things and that 2003 was the dark ages. (Laughter.)

So it makes sense to turn to the other side and say, prove that that's wrong. Prove that the political ends could be served without taking -- without drawing the map that was -- that was before -- that -- that -- that was drawn. No, but the question is, what was the basis for it? Was it politics, as they say, or was it race? So if there isn't -- if no one can point to a way of achieving the political objective, other than through the map that was drawn, then that's evidence that politics was the reason for it. Okay. Well, would you -- Would you accept that a map is necessary, except in a case where there is quite strong evidence -- -- that race was the basis? Well, how much weight do you think the absence of a map is entitled to? I think the -- the evidence with respect to Guilford County is your strongest evidence; but beyond that, the rest of it is not very strong. Well, can I go back to -- to Congressman Watt's testimony? Now, you referred to something other than what I thought you highlighted in your brief. What you highlight in your brief is double hearsay: Congressman Watt said Rucho told him that somebody else told him something, and none of those people is actually the person who drew the map. Now, I don't even know whether any of that is admissible to prove the truth of the matter. But if it is, it's pretty weak evidence. Do you think we should give any consideration to the State court decision, or should we proceed as if it never occurred? But if there's not strong direct evidence, would a map be necessary? ",do they say that that map serve political end to the same degree as the map that be before us if they if they do not say then the fact they we be able to draw another map do not do not really prove anything if if a legislature say this be do on base on politics and there be no way we could have achieve our political objective without do this they can not prove a negative so it make sense to turn to the other side and say prove that that be wrong prove that the political end could be serve without take without draw the map that be that be before that that that be draw no but the question be what be the basis for it be it politics as they say or be it race so if there be not if no one can point to a way of achieve the political objective other than through the map that be draw then that be evidence that politics be the reason for it okay well would you would you accept that a map be necessary except in a case where there be quite strong evidence that race be the basis well how much weight do you think the absence of a map be entitle to i think the the evidence with respect to guilford county be your strong evidence but beyond that the rest of it be not very strong well can i go back to to congressman watt s testimony now you refer to something other than what i think you highlight in your brief what you highlight in your brief be double hearsay congressman watt say rucho tell him that somebody else tell him something and none of those people be actually the person who draw the map now i do not even know whether any of that be admissible to prove the truth of the matter but if it be it be pretty weak evidence do you think we should give any consideration to the state court decision or should we proceed as if it never occur but if there be not strong direct evidence would a map be necessary ,106.99,Roberts Court,"Dec 5, 2016",,,15-1262,"Jun 27, 2016","May 22, 2017",112,0.0,1.0,1.0,0

Suppose we start with race, and the next case involves religion. Now, how would you distinguish religion from race if we were to reach an opposite conclusion in the religious case? Well, is it true with respect to other ethnic groups, or only true with respect to Hispanics? Race is -- race is different for some purposes. But why is it different from other things for Sixth Amendment purposes? What the Sixth Amendment protects is the right to a fair trial -- to an impartial jury. And if we allow the exception that you are advocating, what do you say to the defendant who -- the prisoner who is going to be spending the rest of his life in prison as a result of the jury verdict that was determined by flipping a coin? How does that -- How does that connect with the right to an impartial jury? A jury can be partial for racial reasons. It can be -- -- partial for some other reason. But here we have -- in this case, we have a very blatant statement, but let's consider the standard that now applies on a lot of college campuses as to statements that are considered by some people to be racist. What would happen if one of the jurors has the sensibility of a lot of current college students, and thinks that one of the -- something that's said in the jury room that falls into one of those categories was a racious -- was a racial comment? Even the first time a person says something that is considered improper on a college campus today and another juror thinks that that shows intentional racial bias. Yeah. How will the judge decide -- how will the judge decide whether the statement is -- is racist? The issue of -- of a capital case could involve all sorts of misconduct in the jury room. So suppose it -- it came out later that the jurors at the penalty phase in the capital case said, we don't really care what the law is. We just want to impose capital punishment, or they flipped a coin. Would you -- if there were a special rule for capital cases. Would you draw the distinction based on race? Well, Mr. Fisher, it's not a fear of confronting issues down the road. It's a question of understanding the scope of the rule that you are asking us to adopt. And I'll give you one last chance. You will not tell us today whether your rule applies to discrimination on the basis of -- of religion or gender or sexual orientation or to add another one, political affiliation. So if the jurors -- if it came out the jurors said this person is a Democrat, send him to jail, that would be a different result.

2016,Murr v. Wisconsin,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Do we know -- do we know exactly -- I'm sorry. Do we know exactly how Wisconsin and the county define ""common ownership""? For example, if one lot is owned by an individual in that person's own name, and then the adjacent lot is owned by a wholly-owned corporation or LLC, is that considered to be common ownership? Or if one lot is owned by, let's say, four siblings and the other one is owned by only three of the siblings, would that be common ownership? So if lots are contiguous, that's the end of the question for you; right? Well, let me give you this example. A -- it's not that far from this case. A plumber and his wife buy a small lot, but it's a lot on which you can build houses at that time, and they build a modest house. And they say, you know, we're going to -- there's a lot next door, let's buy that; we can use it as a yard for our children when they're growing up. And then after they're grown, we can sell it, and we'll have some money for retirement. And that's a buildable lot at that time. And then this new regulation is adopted and now the side lot can't be sold at all. And they say: Well, look, you've taken away this valuable asset we were going to use for our retirement. And the answer is: Well, no, because you could -- you could sell your whole property, and somebody who wants to build a big house could build on that property. And they say: Well, that's fine, but we like our little house. We'd like to stay in our little house. Now, what is fair about that situation? What do you mean by they were ""involuntarily merged by government action""? Right. Right. That wouldn't fall under your regulation? And that's a very fine argument, except for the fact that it's completely contrary to the reasoning in Palazzolo. Justice Kennedy's opinion in Palazzolo rejects that. And the debate between Justice O'Connor in concurrence and Justice Scalia in concurrence is about exactly that. And you don't even cite Palazzolo in your brief, do you? Now, which -- If -- if one lot is owned by a wholly owned corporation or an LLC and the other is owned by the owner in the owner's own name, are they considered to be under common ownership under Wisconsin law? No. What -- what about -- Would it matter to you if it were not possible to build a house that bridged the two lots? Suppose one was at the bottom -- one lot is at the bottom of a cliff and the other is at the top of a cliff. Would that matter to you? How can you say that the impact is not -- is categorically not great? If some -- somebody buys a lot next to that person's house with the expectation of selling it at some point in the future to meet real needs that come up then, and then the -- a regulation is adopted that says well, sorry, you can't sell it, that there's no hardship there? Well, that's fine except that, in order to realize the value of the two lots put together, they would have to move away. Now, they think that's irrelevant. I thought the -- I thought that what you're saying is we have to look at what's fair and just, and now you say, well, we disregard the situation of -- of the particular people who are involved. Suppose you have lots that are not contiguous but they're very close to each other. Now, under your flexible approach with all these different dimensions, are they ruled out as a single parcel? That can easily be taken care of by making the rule look to the -- the lots as defined at the time of the acquisition rather than something that was done prior to -- prior to the time when -- when a rule would be -- would be applied. But, you know, it's fine to say that there are all these dimensions and they should be nuanced and who can be opposed to something that's nuanced. But what are we looking for? What are we looking for? We're looking at all these dimensions to determine what? Could you just say as precisely as you can what we would -- we should be looking for in defining what is the property that is taken using all of the different dimensions that are relevant in your view? And is it the economic impact on these particular owners or on some category of hypothetical owners? But what if a lot -- but what if a lot was -- was preserved? What if it was bought for the purpose of selling it at some point in the future and/or it was preserved for that purpose so that nothing was built on it so that it could readily be sold? Well, why wouldn't they be determinative? I thought you said it was we look to legitimate expectations. There, their expectations are completely frustrated. Well, that comes back to my -- but -- but you're saying that they have to move. They can't afford to build a big house here, which is what everybody wants. They don't want these little modest houses anymore. They want McMansions. They -- they have to move. That's what you're saying. ",do we know do we know exactly I be sorry do we know exactly how wisconsin and the county define common ownership for example if one lot be own by an individual in that person s own name and then the adjacent lot be own by a wholly own corporation or llc be that consider to be common ownership or if one lot be own by let us say four sibling and the other one be own by only three of the sibling would that be common ownership so if lot be contiguous that be the end of the question for you right well let me give you this example a it be not that far from this case a plumber and his wife buy a small lot but it be a lot on which you can build house at that time and they build a modest house and they say you know we be go to there be a lot next door let us buy that we can use it as a yard for our child when they be grow up and then after they be grown we can sell it and we will have some money for retirement and that be a buildable lot at that time and then this new regulation be adopt and now the side lot can not be sell at all and they say well look you have take away this valuable asset we we be go to use for our retirement and the answer be well no because you could you could sell your whole property and somebody who want to build a big house could build on that property and they say well that be fine but we like our little house we would like to stay in our little house now what be fair about that situation what do you mean by they we be involuntarily merge by government action right right that would not fall under your regulation and that be a very fine argument except for the fact that it be completely contrary to the reasoning in palazzolo justice kennedy s opinion in palazzolo reject that and the debate between justice oconnor in concurrence and justice scalia in concurrence be about exactly that and you do not even cite palazzolo in your brief do you now which if if one lot be own by a wholly own corporation or an llc and the other be own by the owner in the owner s own name be they consider to be under common ownership under wisconsin law no what what about would it matter to you if it we be not possible to build a house that bridge the two lot suppose one be at the bottom one lot be at the bottom of a cliff and the other be at the top of a cliff would that matter to you how can you say that the impact be not be categorically not great if some somebody buy a lot next to that person s house with the expectation of sell it at some point in the future to meet real need that come up then and then the a regulation be adopt that say well sorry you can not sell it that there be no hardship there well that be fine except that in order to realize the value of the two lot put together they would have to move away now they think that be irrelevant i think the i think that what you be say be we have to look at what be fair and just and now you say well we disregard the situation of of the particular people who be involve suppose you have lot that be not contiguous but they be very close to each other now under your flexible approach with all these different dimension be they rule out as a single parcel that can easily be take care of by make the rule look to the the lot as define at the time of the acquisition rather than something that be do prior to prior to the time when when a rule would be would be apply but you know it be fine to say that there be all these dimension and they should be nuanced and who can be oppose to something that be nuanced but what be we look for what be we look for we be look at all these dimension to determine what could you just say as precisely as you can what we would we should be look for in define what be the property that be take use all of the different dimension that be relevant in your view and be it the economic impact on these particular owner or on some category of hypothetical owner but what if a lot but what if a lot be be preserve what if it be buy for the purpose of sell it at some point in the future andor it be preserve for that purpose so that nothing be build on it so that it could readily be sell well why would not they be determinative i think you say it be we look to legitimate expectation there their expectation be completely frustrate well that come back to my but but you be say that they have to move they can not afford to build a big house here which be what everybody want they do not want these little modest house anymore they want mcmansions they they have to move that be what you be say ,279.15,Roberts Court,"Mar 20, 2017","Joseph P.

2016,McWilliams v. Dunn,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Mr. Bright -- As I understand your position -- and you'll correct me if I'm wrong -- you seem to be arguing that what the defendant is entitled to is an expert who will function, more or less, like the kind of expert who would be retained by the defense, if the defense were simply given funds to -- to hire an expert. Am I right in -- in thinking that? But I -- but in terms of what this expert would do, you'd want an expert who would function more or less like that. Right. Yeah, well, that's what I'm -- -- that's what I'm getting at. I don't see how an expert who is chosen by the court and paid by the court can ever function in anything like that capacity for a defendant. And one thing that is perfectly clear from the opinion in Ake, is that the court would pick the expert, and it's one -- the court will pick one expert and that's it; the defense has to live with it. And I just -- if you could explain how that kind of an expert can ever function like an expert retained by the defense. It is different from a lawyer, because a lawyer -- you know, a lawyer doesn't have to believe in the client's innocence. The lawyer has a professional duty, within the bounds of -- of professional responsibility, to do everything that can be done to advance the interests of the client. But an expert who's going to write a report and is going to testify, presumably, if the person acts in good faith, is going to give an honest opinion. Am I wrong? So what would you say to this court-appointed -- you -- you get one expert that's appointed -- what do you say to this expert? Now, I don't really want you to give your neutral opinion. I want to give you -- I want you to give your most defense-friendly opinion on this? Well, no, I understand. That really wasn't my question. I -- of course you could ask the expert, you know, give me the -- give me whatever is most favorable, give me advice that is most favorable to my client. But when it comes down to giving an opinion about whether the individual is sane or -- or something that's relevant to mitigation, I don't see how you can ask the expert to do anything other than to give the expert's honest professional opinion. So it doesn't -- it's -- I'm having difficulty seeing how an expert who is appointed by the court -- you get one -- could ever function that way. And I -- I read the oral argument transcript in this case, and there are several places in the oral argument transcript when -- where the court and the attorney for Ake equates an -- an expert who is appointed by the court with a neutral expert. And that seems to be what that kind of an expert would be, a neutral expert, not an expert who is really part of the defense team. Mr. Brasher, I thought the question on which we granted cert was whether somebody with the status of Dr. Goff sat -- whether it was clearly established that somebody with the status of Dr. Goff did not satisfy Ake, not whether Dr. Goff, given his status, did the things that he was supposed to do under Ake. No that's true. There have been a lot of lower courts, a lot of smart judges have read Ake and they found it ambiguous. And I wonder if this may have been what went on in their minds. We know what's -- what was going on in Ake because we have written opinions like that, and we have joined opinions like that. This is an opinion that is deliberately ambiguous, because there was probably disagreement among the members of the majority about how far they wanted to go. Do you think that's a reasonable hypothesis? ",mr bright as i understand your position and you will correct me if I be wrong you seem to be argue that what the defendant be entitle to be an expert who will function more or less like the kind of expert who would be retain by the defense if the defense we be simply give fund to to hire an expert be i right in in thinking that but i but in term of what this expert would do you would want an expert who would function more or less like that right yeah well that be what I be that be what I be get at i do not see how an expert who be choose by the court and pay by the court can ever function in anything like that capacity for a defendant and one thing that be perfectly clear from the opinion in ake be that the court would pick the expert and it be one the court will pick one expert and that be it the defense have to live with it and i just if you could explain how that kind of an expert can ever function like an expert retain by the defense it be different from a lawyer because a lawyer you know a lawyer do not have to believe in the client s innocence the lawyer have a professional duty within the bound of of professional responsibility to do everything that can be do to advance the interest of the client but an expert who be go to write a report and be go to testify presumably if the person act in good faith be go to give an honest opinion be i wrong so what would you say to this court appoint you you get one expert that be appoint what do you say to this expert now i do not really want you to give your neutral opinion i want to give you i want you to give your most defense friendly opinion on this well no i understand that really be not my question i of course you could ask the expert you know give me the give me whatever be most favorable give me advice that be most favorable to my client but when it come down to give an opinion about whether the individual be sane or or something that be relevant to mitigation i do not see how you can ask the expert to do anything other than to give the expert s honest professional opinion so it do not it be I be have difficulty see how an expert who be appoint by the court you get one could ever function that way and i i read the oral argument transcript in this case and there be several place in the oral argument transcript when where the court and the attorney for ake equates an an expert who be appoint by the court with a neutral expert and that seem to be what that kind of an expert would be a neutral expert not an expert who be really part of the defense team mr brasher i think the question on which we grant cert be whether somebody with the status of dr goff sit whether it be clearly establish that somebody with the status of dr goff do not satisfy ake not whether dr goff give his status do the thing that he be suppose to do under ake no that be true there have be a lot of low court a lot of smart judge have read ake and they find it ambiguous and i wonder if this may have be what go on in their mind we know what be what be go on in ake because we have write opinion like that and we have join opinion like that this be an opinion that be deliberately ambiguous because there be probably disagreement among the member of the majority about how far they want to go do you think that be a reasonable hypothesis ,227.79999999999995,Roberts Court,"Apr 24, 2017",James E.

What if the legislature says, look, we want to follow all the traditional districting, applying all the traditional districting factors. However, one thing we absolutely do not want is to be held to have violated Section 5 or Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. So we have these 12 majority-African-American districts, and we don't want to do anything to them that results in liability under the Voting Rights Act. Is that predominance? I didn't really understand the answer to the question. If the court says -- if the State says, the one thing we absolutely do not want is to be found to violate the -- the Voting Rights Act, that is not -- that -- that is not necessarily predominance, in your view? Wasn't there a primary in 2005 in that district where Representative Tyler won over a white candidate by less than 300 votes? But these -- these districts are going to last for a decade, are they not? And -- and there's no guarantee that these same candidates are going to be running throughout that decade. So you think they have to take into account this very complicated analysis: Well, it was the -- the person is an incumbent, and therefore is going to have the incumbent's advantage, and -- Well, I mean, that gets to an interesting point. What -- to what -- what degree of confidence that it will remain a -- a majority-minority district is necessary to have a strong basis in evidence? I don't want to take up your response.

There's no way -- And -- and maybe there's no way around this; but this is all, as you -- as you lay it out, very, very complicated.

2016,Expressions Hair Design v. Schneiderman,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Can I go back to -- -- Justice Kagan's hypothetical. It doesn't address the situation where dual prices are posted, but it addresses a situation where there is a dual-price regime. Some consumers are going to pay more; some consumers are going to pay less. And in her hypothetical, she says the sticker price is the higher price. And then when the cash purchaser comes to the cash register, the purchaser gets a pleasant surprise. No, you are going to be charged less. But I thought your argument was that this -- if that is the correct interpretation of the statute, and -- and I don't really know what the statute means and we don't have a definitive interpretation. But if that is the correct interpretation of the statute, what New York State has done is to force the merchant to say -- to post a particular sticker price -- namely, the higher sticker price -- as opposed to the lower sticker price. So that is mandated speech. Isn't that your argument? Well, under that interpretation, if it's okay to post the higher price and nothing more, and if the higher price is the credit card price, they are -- they are forcing the merchant to speak in a particular way. I'm going to say when I first read this statute without knowing anything about the background with the Federal statute or reading the briefs or the Second Circuit opinion, I interpreted it the way Justice Sotomayor did, that it mandates a single price. Now, that may be a -- an uninformed interpretation, but I feel somewhat uncomfortable about ruling on the constitutionality of this statute without knowing how the court of appeals, New York court of appeals would interpret the statute. So why shouldn't we certify that question of interpretation to that court before we plunge into this First Amendment issue? Could I just ask you a preliminary question about the division of litigation authority in New York State? Does the attorney general or the solicitor general have the authority under New York law to bind all of the district attorneys in the State to an interpretation of this statute? And has the attorney general issued a -- an official interpretation so that all of the district attorneys will be required to -- to enforce this in the same way? Yeah. But, see, that's a -- That's a problem for me. How many district attorneys are there in New York State? There are many. So you tell us how you interpret this, but how do we know how all of these other district attorneys are going to interpret the statute? They may interpret it differently. Then why didn't New York -- I mean, New York adopted this against the backdrop of a lot of consideration at the Federal level. Why did it not adopt the Federal definitions? Well, if I had the authority to interpret the New York statute, which I really don't, and I saw that they copied part of a prior statute, but they deliberately omitted other parts of the prior statute, I would be tempted to infer that they had a reason for omitting the definitions. And that was that they didn't want to be bound by that, so they wanted something different. Does this apply -- Does this apply to all merchants? Anybody who sells anything? I mean, suppose some kids have a lemonade stand or they're washing cars and they say a glass of lemonade, $1 and then somebody comes up to them and says I'd like to buy that with a credit card. It might happen today. I have -- I have never seen anybody younger than me buy anything with cash. But that would be a violation if they put the $1 there on the assumption that everybody is going to pay cash for their lemonade. These are tech savvy kids so they can -- could process a credit card purchase if they wanted to?

Would there be anything -- suppose a trustee or the attorney for a debtor said, I am going to -- let's say this case is in Alabama. The statute of limitations for the collection of debt in Alabama is six years. I am going to object to every -- any claim for a debt that was incurred more than six years ago. Would -- would that be inconsistent with the duties of the trustee or the attorney? Well, I'll -- I'll ask Mr. Geyser the same question, but it -- I can't understand why a trustee or an attorney wouldn't take that -- wouldn't take that approach -- -- automatically object to anything that is over the -- the statute of limitations. May I ask you the question that I -- I asked your -- your adversary. Why -- why do these time-barred claims slip through? I mean, that's a big part of your argument. Why don't trustees and attorneys for the debtor automatically object to any claim that is beyond the number of years set out in the statute of limitations? Why is there a big cost in -- in filing an objection? I can't believe you couldn't even have -- you could have a computer program that does this automatically. I can't understand why it would be very difficult. But how many of these would there be in the typical Chapter 13? I find this is a very difficult case because if -- if your description of Midland's business model is correct, it doesn't seem to me that it has much, if any, social utility. On the other hand, I have real a problem with your -- with fitting your argument into the concept of an affirmative defense. I thought an affirmative defense was a rule of law that may allow the defendant to prevail if the defendant asserts the defense. But you want to switch -- you're switching that over to the side of the plaintiff or the person filing the claim. It seems inconsistent with the whole idea of an affirmative defense. The idea of an affirmative defense -- let's take statute of limitations. The idea is that the defendant may escape liability based on the statute of limitations, but only if a defendant asserts the defense and, if necessary, proves it. And if a defendant doesn't do that, then the law is perfectly content with having a recovery on a claim that would have otherwise been time barred. Do you think this good faith defense is objective or subjective? It's objective? And you said -- take the case of -- this was the third debt collection act. You're just talking about debt collectors. So -- but let's under bankruptcy, you have a single creditor, a person who owns a sandwich shop has a claim. It's -- it turns out that it's clearly barred by the statute of limitations, files that claim. That's sanctionable conduct? As legal matter, it would be under your interpretation. Subjective. They were acting in perfect good faith subjectively, but not objectively.

2016,Lee v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","But is that -- I don't think that's -- Mr. Bursch, I don't think that's a manageable standard. I -- I see a number of possible standards that could be used here. One is purely subjective: What would this defendant have done? I understand the concept; it creates a lot of practical difficulties. Another objective standard would be, is there a reasonable probability of a better outcome if the defendant had gone to trial? That's manageable. That's standard Strickland. But if the test is, would a rational defendant have in -- have gone to trial given the -- the sentence that would be -- that the defendant might face if convicted discounted by the probability of conviction versus the consequences of -- of deportation, I -- I don't know how to do that. It's -- it's -- because it -- it depends on how a particular person values those two things. Isn't it -- is it irrational to try to climb Mount Everest without oxygen? I mean, is it irrational to swim with sharks or perform on a tightrope without a net? I mean, I wouldn't do those things, but people do it. I can't say they're irrational. They're much less risk averse and they value things differently. I -- I think -- -- it's an unmanageable standard. Well, I -- you have very sympathetic facts, but suppose we change the variables a bit. You know, they both can -- they both are a sliding scale. So you have a much more serious -- the potential for a much more serious sentence. Let's say, if the person is convicted, the person will serve eight years. And you have a person who has many more ties to the country to which the person would be removed. Now, how do you make that -- how do you decide whether that's rational? At what point does it become irrational? But that points to a purely subjective test, which, as I said, is conceptually coherent, but creates a lot of practical difficulties, because then the Court is going to have to try to recreate what the defendant would have done. And, of course, after the defendant has been in prison for a while and is facing deportation, the person -- the person, I mean, I don't know, may have second thoughts. It's very hard to recreate that. But is that what you're asking us to do, to adopt a purely subjective standard? You say no. What is -- All of that -- -- all of that is true on the facts of this case. But I have to ask the same question -- I don't want to beat a dead horse, but you can change the facts. So you have a defendant with more ties to Korea. He didn't come here as a young man. He came here when he was 25 years old. He still has some relatives and friends in Korea. The sentence that he faces here is much higher. Let's say it's five years or it's eight years or it's ten years. At what point -- how do you decide whether it's rational. Well -- Well, what would you do as a district -- how would you evaluate that as a district court judge? Well, that -- That's a purely subjective test. What happens if there's overwhelming evidence that this defendant, that the defendant in the case would have gone to trial if the defendant knew about the deportation consequences, overwhelming subjective evidence, statements before the plea was entered, but also, virtually no chance of acquittal had the defendant gone to trial. What happens then? Because defendant -- No, I -- finish your sentence. I'm sorry. No, no, that's fine. I -- I understand the argument that the test should be purely subjective. What would this defendant have done? There's language in Hill that supports that. The language that says is it rational under the circumstances is contrary to that, as I read it, because rationality is not a matter of -- is not a subjective thing. It's objective. But let's say it is a purely subjective question. Then I think it's a question of historical fact. So you have to have a finding of fact by somebody, presumably the judge, in the 2255, and that would be reviewed for clear error. Would that -- wouldn't that follow? No, I'm not proposing that test, but I'm -- I'm suggesting that that is the consequence of our saying that the test is purely subjective. We can't decide that this defendant would have, as a matter of fact, gone to trial had he been properly advised. That's a -- that's a factual question, purely historic fact. It would have to go back to a judge to make a finding of fact on that question. In this case or in any case. ",but be that i do not think that be mr bursch i do not think that be a manageable standard i i see a number of possible standard that could be use here one be purely subjective what would this defendant have do i understand the concept it create a lot of practical difficulty another objective standard would be be there a reasonable probability of a good outcome if the defendant have go to trial that be manageable that be standard strickland but if the test be would a rational defendant have in have go to trial give the the sentence that would be that the defendant might face if convict discount by the probability of conviction versus the consequence of of deportation i i do not know how to do that it be it be because it it depend on how a particular person value those two thing be not it be it irrational to try to climb mount everest without oxygen i mean be it irrational to swim with shark or perform on a tightrope without a net i mean i would not do those thing but people do it i can not say they be irrational they be much less risk averse and they value thing differently i i think it be an unmanageable standard well i you have very sympathetic fact but suppose we change the variable a bit you know they both can they both be a sliding scale so you have a much more serious the potential for a much more serious sentence let us say if the person be convict the person will serve eight year and you have a person who have many more tie to the country to which the person would be remove now how do you make that how do you decide whether that be rational at what point do it become irrational but that point to a purely subjective test which as i say be conceptually coherent but create a lot of practical difficulty because then the court be go to have to try to recreate what the defendant would have do and of course after the defendant have be in prison for a while and be face deportation the person the person i mean i do not know may have second thought it be very hard to recreate that but be that what you be ask us to do to adopt a purely subjective standard you say no what be all of that all of that be true on the fact of this case but i have to ask the same question i do not want to beat a dead horse but you can change the fact so you have a defendant with more tie to korea he do not come here as a young man he come here when he be year old he still have some relative and friend in korea the sentence that he face here be much high let us say it be five year or it have eight year or it be ten year at what point how do you decide whether it be rational well well what would you do as a district how would you evaluate that as a district court judge well that that be a purely subjective test what happen if there be overwhelming evidence that this defendant that the defendant in the case would have go to trial if the defendant know about the deportation consequence overwhelm subjective evidence statement before the plea be enter but also virtually no chance of acquittal have the defendant go to trial what happen then because defendant no i finish your sentence I be sorry no no that be fine i i understand the argument that the test should be purely subjective what would this defendant have do there be language in hill that support that the language that say be it rational under the circumstance be contrary to that as i read it because rationality be not a matter of be not a subjective thing it be objective but let us say it be a purely subjective question then i think it be a question of historical fact so you have to have a finding of fact by somebody presumably the judge in the and that would be review for clear error would that would not that follow no I be not propose that test but I be I be suggest that that be the consequence of our say that the test be purely subjective we can not decide that this defendant would have as a matter of fact go to trial have he be properly advise that be a that be a factual question purely historic fact it would have to go back to a judge to make a finding of fact on that question in this case or in any case ,267.07000000000005,Roberts Court,"Mar 28, 2017",Jae Lee,United States,16-327,"Dec 14, 2016","Jun 23, 2017",112,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

2016,Hernandez v. Mesa,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","I mean, we can take -- -- your test point by point and -- and ask you whether it would apply in a situation where each of those factors was a little bit different. So the -- your client was 15. What if he was 19? Would that be different? So the rule would apply there. All right. What if he was armed, but he had his hands up? What if he wasn't in this culvert, but he was 200 yards beyond in Mexico. Would it be different then? And what if the officer was not standing in the United States, but actually ran a short distance across the border into Mexico? That would seem to be worse, wouldn't it? But would you say the rule would be different there? Right. So suppose he violates that rule. He -- he -- -- crosses into Mexico and then he shoots the -- -- the Mexican nationals. No, I understand that. But as Justice Breyer said, we have to articulate a rule that applies. We can't just say that in -- that -- that on the particular facts here, there was -- the -- Mr. Hernandez's -- the -- the Petitioner's have a -- have a Bivens claim and -- and they're -- it states a violation of the Fourth Amendment. We have to have a rule to -- that can be applied in other cases. And I don't know what the rule -- what rule you want us to adopt other than to say you win. And, of course, that's what you -- you need to do for your client. But you need to give us a principle that is workable. Is it -- is your rule that if the U.S. agent commits on foreign soil an action that would be a violation had it occurred within the United States, there is a Bivens claim and there is a Fourth Amendment violation? Is that your rule? Could I ask you to go back to Justice Kagan's question? If the -- if the officer here was a State or a local officer, would you be able to file a claim for damages in the United States in a Federal court? Oh, well, put that aside. Let's assume this is in Mexico. Plainly in Mexico. Would -- would you have a claim against a State or a local officer? And if not, isn't it anomalous for us to say that you have a claim under Bivens? Well, what would the government -- What would the government of Mexico say if we wrote an opinion that says because the United States spent a lot of money to pave this culvert, we think that the United States' authority with respect to the culvert is basically the same as the authority that we have in Guantanamo. ",i mean we can take your test point by point and and ask you whether it would apply in a situation where each of those factor be a little bit different so the your client be what if he be would that be different so the rule would apply there all right what if he be arm but he have his hand up what if he be not in this culvert but he be yard beyond in mexico would it be different then and what if the officer be not stand in the united state but actually run a short distance across the border into mexico that would seem to be bad would not it but would you say the rule would be different there right so suppose he violate that rule he he cross into mexico and then he shoot the the mexican national no i understand that but as justice breyer say we have to articulate a rule that applies we can not just say that in that that on the particular fact here there be the mr hernandez s the the petitioner s have a have a bivens claim and and they be it state a violation of the fourth amendment we have to have a rule to that can be apply in other case and i do not know what the rule what rule you want us to adopt other than to say you win and of course that be what you you need to do for your client but you need to give us a principle that be workable be it be your rule that if the us agent commits on foreign soil an action that would be a violation have it occur within the united state there be a bivens claim and there be a fourth amendment violation be that your rule could i ask you to go back to justice kagan s question if the if the officer here be a state or a local officer would you be able to file a claim for damage in the united state in a federal court oh well put that aside let us assume this be in mexico plainly in mexico would would you have a claim against a state or a local officer and if not be not it anomalous for us to say that you have a claim under bivens well what would the government what would the government of mexico say if we write an opinion that say because the united state spend a lot of money to pave this culvert we think that the united state authority with respect to the culvert be basically the same as the authority that we have in guantanamo ,150.26999999999995,Roberts Court,"Feb 21, 2017","Jesus C.

2016,Weaver v. Massachusetts,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","So what -- what you're saying, and I -- I think this is true -- is that there are circumstances in which closing the courtroom can have an effect on the outcome of the -- of the trial. But, conversely, is it your position that it's never possible for there to be a violation of the right without there being an effect on the trial; that it's never possible to show that this could not have had any effect on the outcome? As a practical matter -- As a practical matter, it's never possible to show that it -- there -- it would -- there would be no outcome -- no effect on the outcome? So in this -- In -- in this case, what's your best theory about how this could have affected the trial? What happened here? Well, suppose the two people who couldn't get in were members of the public, but not the defendant's mother and her pastor. Well, it's not a question of putting two wrongs together. I mean, the Commonwealth's argument and the argument of the United States is that there is no violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel unless the -- the counsel's performance deprived the defendant of a -- a fair trial. It's -- this is not a Sixth Amendment speedy trial -- I'm sorry -- public-trial act issue. It's a right-to-counsel issue. And prejudice is built into the Sixth Amendment Strickland standard because the defendant had an attorney. So on what theory was the defendant deprived of an attorney? Well, the theory is, although there was somebody sitting next to that defendant and asking questions and pretending to be an attorney, that attorney was so bad that he might as well not have had an attorney. So it's built right in. And so, ultimately, there has to be the determination for there to be a Sixth Amendment right-to-trial violation that there was prejudice. Now, you can make the argument that it's impossible to tell whether there was prejudice, but it's built right into the speedy -- into the -- a right to counsel. And -- and you have to say that that's always true, or it's -- it's true in such a high percentage of the cases that there's no point in even making that an issue, no matter how steep the burden that the prosecution might have to satisfy. Let's put this label aside for a minute. You really think that it's impossible, that there can never be a case where a violation like the one that took place here had no effect on the outcome of the trial? It's impossible to ever -- for there ever to be such a case -- Well, that's a different -- I mean, that's a different situation. Suppose the only people who wanted to go -- the only members of the public who wanted to be in this -- in the courtroom were the family and the friends of the victims of a crime. So it would be a hostile audience. Unless it's a -- unless the fact that it's a structural error is fatal, then in the situation -- in -- in the hypothetical Justice Ginsburg provided, wouldn't it be open to you to prove that it was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt? Is there a distinction between the -- the examples that you gave where -- where it would appear that the issue would be a question of harmless error, and the situation here, where the question is whether there's a constitutional error at all? No. But that's not the error that's -- that is before us. The error -- the alleged error that's before us is a violation -- -- of the right to trial -- the right to counsel. Okay. It was probably not very clear. The error -- what we are being asked to address is the right to counsel; am I right? And there is no violation of the right to counsel based purely on deficient performance; isn't that right? So there has to be -- the prejudice prong has to be satisfied. So your -- your examples were ineffective assistance of counsel cases, not just Batson cases. ",so what what you be say and i i think this be true be that there be circumstance in which close the courtroom can have an effect on the outcome of the of the trial but conversely be it your position that it be never possible for there to be a violation of the right without there be an effect on the trial that it be never possible to show that this could not have have any effect on the outcome as a practical matter as a practical matter it be never possible to show that it there it would there would be no outcome no effect on the outcome so in this in in this case what be your best theory about how this could have affect the trial what happen here well suppose the two people who could not get in we be member of the public but not the defendant s mother and her pastor well it be not a question of put two wrong together i mean the commonwealth s argument and the argument of the united state be that there be no violation of the sixth amendment right to counsel unless the the counsel s performance deprive the defendant of a a fair trial it be this be not a sixth amendment speedy trial I be sorry public trial act issue it be a right to counsel issue and prejudice be build into the sixth amendment strickland standard because the defendant have an attorney so on what theory be the defendant deprive of an attorney well the theory be although there be somebody sit next to that defendant and ask question and pretend to be an attorney that attorney be so bad that he might as well not have have an attorney so it be build right in and so ultimately there have to be the determination for there to be a sixth amendment right to trial violation that there be prejudice now you can make the argument that it be impossible to tell whether there be prejudice but it be build right into the speedy into the a right to counsel and and you have to say that that be always true or it be it be true in such a high percentage of the case that there be no point in even make that an issue no matter how steep the burden that the prosecution might have to satisfy let us put this label aside for a minute you really think that it be impossible that there can never be a case where a violation like the one that take place here have no effect on the outcome of the trial it be impossible to ever for there ever to be such a case well that be a different i mean that be a different situation suppose the only people who want to go the only member of the public who want to be in this in the courtroom we be the family and the friend of the victim of a crime so it would be a hostile audience unless it be a unless the fact that it be a structural error be fatal then in the situation in in the hypothetical justice ginsburg provide would not it be open to you to prove that it be harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt be there a distinction between the the example that you give where where it would appear that the issue would be a question of harmless error and the situation here where the question be whether there be a constitutional error at all no but that be not the error that be that be before us the error the allege error that be before us be a violation of the right to trial the right to counsel okay it be probably not very clear the error what we be be ask to address be the right to counsel be i right and there be no violation of the right to counsel base purely on deficient performance be not that right so there have to be the prejudice prong have to be satisfy so your your example we be ineffective assistance of counsel case not just batson case ,218.26999999999995,Roberts Court,"Apr 19, 2017",Kentel Myrone Weave,Commonwealth of Massachusetts,16-240,"Jan 13, 2017","Jun 22, 2017",112,0.0,1.0,0.0,0
2016,Goodyear Tire v. Haeger,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","I think it's pretty easy to think of hypotheticals and how they might be unrealistic, in which the eventual disclosure of some piece of information that should have been disclosed a lot earlier is so fatal to the defense that the case would be settled as soon as that came to light. You think it's impossible to imagine something like that? Suppose there were some internal Goodyear document here that said, you know, we are going to sell this. We are going to market this to RVs, but we know it's really not suitable for RVs. And so if people put it on an RV and they are driving around in a hot climate, the tire is going to explode. I mean, if you had an internal document like that, it wouldn't be very hard to say, wow, once this comes out, we are going to have no option but to settle the issue of liability. Well, if you're not -- and I -- I thought you admitted earlier that it wouldn't be appropriate for us to say that could never happen, or maybe I misunderstood your answer. But suppose we think that there could be circumstances in which a court could say this would have settled based on the fatal nature of the disclosure. This would have settled sooner, had it been properly disclosed. You would have to fall back on a rule that says this is never -- it -- although a court is sometimes permitted to do this, legal rule has to be it has to be done only in the clearest of cases or something like that. You -- you just said, I thought, that the Ninth Circuit accepted a causation requirement. Did you just say that? I didn't read the -- the Ninth Circuit opinion that way. I'm looking at page 32A of the appendix of the petition. The Ninth Circuit reads Chambers to mean that all attorneys' fees may be awarded once the sanctionees begin to flout their clear discovery obligations and engage in frequent and severe abuses of the judicial system, and then it goes on to say that -- that the district court -- that there wasn't -- that the Supreme Court expressly rejected the linkage argument made by the sanctionees. So that doesn't seem to me to be accepting any kind of causation requirement; rather, to say where you've got very frequent and -- and pervasive abuse, you get everything. The Ninth Circuit did not hold that there was a waiver, did it? What does that mean? Is that different from saying that it caused everything? To say that it permeated everything, is that the same thing as saying that it -- it caused everything?

2016,Kindred Nursing Centers Limited Partnership v. Clark,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","What about if the category were fundamental rights that implicate the -- the individual's life or health, so that you would have to have an express provision giving the attorney-in-fact authorization to consent to various procedures that a terminally ill person might undergo, and if this were put in that category? Well, in this case, what's involved here is care for a -- a person who is unable to look after that -- that person's own care, an elderly person, a disabled person in a -- in a nursing facility. So what if that were lumped together with consent to surgery, consent to terminate feeding, or -- or breathing for a terminally-ill patient. All of those could be put into a category that implicate life or health. But the -- But the context here seems different from the arbitration cases that we've had in recent years. This doesn't involve an -- an arbitration about the amount that you were charged for your cable bill or for your telephone bill. This involves a situation where an elderly person needs care. And as Justice Kennedy's hypothetical mentioned, it may be that the only facility that's available, or all of the facilities, require the signing of an -- an arbitration agreement which prevents the assertion of tort claims and the -- the elimination of the deterrents that they provide may really implicate the care of someone who is vulnerable. So this seems like something that is close to or that it falls squarely within the police power of a State. Now, I suppose that there's a connection here to interstate commerce, I don't know what exactly it is, but on the assumption that everything is connected to interstate commerce, I assume that this falls within the FAA. But you see the problem? This is really taking the arbitration precedence that we have handed down in recent years into a different category of interests. Well, what about the Wellner -- the Wellner documents. As I read what the court said in the first part of its discussion about that, it just interpreted the power of attorney as not reaching arbitration. So there it was just exercising its ordinary powers of contract interpretation. Well, do you think every time a State court incorrectly interprets a power of attorney relating to -- as it relates to arbitration, that that raises an FAA preemption issue?

2016,County of Los Angeles v. Mendez,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Can I ask a follow-up question on that? Isn't -- if, in Justice Kennedy's hypothetical that there had been an application for a warrant, isn't it entirely possible, particularly under the facts that he hypothesized, that the judge would say you don't need an arrest warrant in this situation? You can ask the defendant's attorney to bring the defendant in and surrender. I know that that's happened quite a few times. That's -- that was a different context. It had to do with an exception to the warrant requirement. But the problem with your test, as you articulate it, and as I understand it, is that you start out with something that is said to be unreasonable, but it is not a violation of the Fourth Amendment. And you impose liability for that decision, not for the ultimate decision to use deadly force. And -- and this has come up in a situation like Sheehan where there's a dispute about whether it's reasonable for -- you have a -- a mentally disturbed person and let's say the person has a hostage in a house or there's an innocent person there and the mentally disturbed person is acting in a way that seems to present a serious threat to the -- the innocent person in the house. And there's a dispute about whether it's reasonable for the police to enter as opposed to waiting for a -- a psychological expert or -- or they only have negotiations for a short period of time before they enter and it's argued that wasn't reasonable, that's not good police practice, they should have waited a longer period of time, and you end up imposing liability. And then once they go in, then they're in a -- in a life-threatening situation and they use force. You end up imposing liability for what is arguably a violation of best police practices, or something that is recommended by experts in this situation. That's what's anomalous about the rule that you've -- that you've suggested. Well, but that's a different way of looking at the situation. And I agree, that that's a -- you know, that's -- that's the question that you would think you would address under the Fourth Amendment. You start out with the Fourth Amendment violation, and then you say, did it proximately cause the use of deadly force? But not the rule that you suggested where you start out with something that isn't a violation of the Fourth Amendment, whether or not it represents best police practices or not. Well, it may very well be a seizure. If they -- if they interfere with the liberty of the person who they approach, then it's a -- then it's a seizure, it's a stop. And that would be the situation in the hypothetical that Justice Sotomayor mentioned, which was presented in your brief, where the police officer jumps in front of a car and doesn't allow the driver enough time to stop. And then as the driver is approaching the police officer, the police officer shoots. That's a seizure. And so you look at the entire seizure, the jumping in front of the car, plus the ultimate shooting to determine whether it's reasonable. But the Fourth Amendment doesn't prohibit unreasonable interactions. What it prohibits is unreasonable searches and seizures. So it's entirely appropriate to look at the whole seizure, but not this chain of interactions that includes a lot of things that happened before there ever is conduct that implicates the Fourth Amendment. Well, let me give you two situations. Situation A: The officers get a warrant, they go to the residence, they knock on the door. The resident opens the door. They say: We have a search warrant. We're going to search your house. All right? Situation B: They don't get a search warrant. They think they have exigent circumstances. They knock on the door. And they -- in both cases, they're uniformed police officers. They say: We're police officers. We're here; we're going to search your house. We don't have a warrant. We think we have -- we can search your house without a warrant because we have an exception to the warrant requirement. Now, is there more -- is it more likely that there's going to be violence in the second situation than in the first situation? I -- I -- I don't see why there is. Well, then, then I don't see where there's proximate cause. Yeah. And in my hypothetical, the -- what I -- I neglected to say but should have said was that there weren't exigent circumstances. So the -- the entry was unlawful, but they had a warrant -- they -- they -- but you still have those two situations. In one case, they have a warrant. The other case, they say: We think -- and they turn out to be wrong -- that we don't need a warrant. But I don't -- I asked you whether there's a greater risk of violence in one than the other, and I -- I'd like to hear your -- your answer. Why would there be a greater risk of violence in the situation where the -- the resident knows that it's -- that they are police officers and they're going to conduct a search, as opposed to the situation where there's -- where there's a warrant? Any -- any violence that the resident directs at the police officer is illegal in both situations; right? It's not justified for them to attack the police. They -- ""Well, I know"" -- ""You know, I know -- I know you're a police officer, but I don't think you really have an exception to the warrant requirement, so I'm going to shoot you."" They can't do that, can they? So -- ",can i ask a follow up question on that be not if in justice kennedy s hypothetical that there have be an application for a warrant be not it entirely possible particularly under the fact that

2016,Kokesh v. SEC,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, this case puts us in a rather strange position, because we have to decide whether this is a penalty or a forfeiture. But in order to decide whether this thing is a penalty or a forfeiture, we need to understand what this thing is. And in order to understand what it is, it would certainly be helpful and maybe essential to know what the authority for it is. So how do we get out of that -- out of that situation? How do we decide whether it is a penalty or a forfeiture without fully understanding what this form of this remedy or this, whatever it is, where it comes from and -- and its exact nature? Well, why don't we take it as we find it in this particular case? So is there any difficulty in identifying the victims in this particular case and ensuring that the money that was misappropriated from them by your client goes to them and not into the government's coffers? But, again, we don't know. How do we know that the government has the authority to direct it wherever it wants? Are there any time -- are there any time limits, and if so, where do they come from?

2016,Advocate Health Care Network v. Stapleton,112,"Samuel A.

The -- the -- the hypothetical would be like this case, or this case would be like the hypothetical. If the requirement that the plan be established by the church was absolutely critical, as the requirement that the -- the individual have a disability is absolutely critical in the hypothetical, which gets to the question: What is the significance, in practical terms, of a plan's being established by a church? Now, Mr. Feldman says that an entity that establishes a plan is financially responsible for paying benefits under the plan if the plan is unable to do that with its assets. But you say that's not correct; is that right? Can you -- can you tell me what provision of ERISA -- and I'll ask Mr. Feldman the same thing if I have the chance -- what provision of ERISA explains which entity, if any, is responsible for paying benefits if, for example, a defined benefit plan is unable to do that with the assets in the plan? Well, wasn't Ms. Blatt incorrect when she said that the complaints seek billions of dollars in penalties? What is the answer to my question? Well, they -- if you figured out the penalties, would they be billions of dollars? Then how can you say that this is primarily about forward-looking things? I understand that. But, I mean, you said that this is primarily -- oh, don't worry about the penalties; this is primarily about forward-looking things. And yet the complaints asked for the penalties. Are you willing on behalf of your clients to disavow any requests for penalties? Then how can you say that it's primarily about forward-looking. -- remedies. Well, they had to -- -- whatever -- whatever reliance was reasonable based on these hundreds of letters, that's one thing. How about relying on the literal meaning of the central statutory provision? Well, I'm talking about -- -- the literal language of (C)(i), and you're now talking about everything else. The literal language of (C)(i) says: A plan established and maintained by a church includes a plan that is maintained by a principal-purpose organization. And it's as simple as that, that read literally, it is not required that it be established -- -- by a church. Now, you have other arguments, but -- Well, in the situation where the church establishes the plan and then turns over the maintenance of the plan to a principal-purpose organization, the audits would be the books of the principal-purpose organization. There wouldn't be very much to look for in the records of the church. So if that's the -- if that was the purpose of it, I don't see what the establishment requirement -- But you say -- where -- where do I look to find that? And where do I look to find the provision that says what you say, which is that the entity that establishes the plan is financially responsible? It's -- it's responsible -- it's responsible to the extent the plan makes it responsible? Is that the answer? But where is the provision that -- But where is the provision of ERISA that supports what you said, which is -- it seems to me to be a significant point, that the entity that establishes the plan is financially responsible for the plan. What is the provision of ERISA -- -- that says that? Are you saying that the only purpose of the amendment was to avoid the sunset provision? All right. So the -- that avoiding the sunset provision was not the only purpose. I think that's what you just said a couple minutes ago. Because they honestly would have to do something else, right?

Because the vacated conviction may be worthless for a reason that is irrelevant to the point that Justice Kagan was making, which seems to be the situation here. It's -- it's a wrongful conviction because an element was missing, but that doesn't undermine the argument that the two verdicts were inconsistent. They lack legal effect, but it is a historical fact that it occurs. So surely they can be used to prove a historical fact. For example, suppose there's a case in which the -- in which the question is whether a witness who testified for the prosecution was bribed. Surely the -- the conviction could be used in that situation, right? Well, does that position extend to anything that affects the evidence in the case, so that if any prosecution evidence is improperly admitted or any defense evidence is improperly excluded, the same would follow? I thought your answer to Justice Ginsburg was that if there was a particular kind of error that resulted in the reversal, then the conviction could not be used to show inconsistency in the verdicts. Did I misunderstand your answer? The question on which we granted review refers to a vacated unconstitutional conviction. But is that what we have here? Is this an unconstitutional conviction? Well, it was an erroneous instruction, so it was instructional error. Is that a constitutional error? Sorry. Is every instructional error a constitutional error? So if there were a harmless error issue in this case, what would the standard be? It would have to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because it's a constitutional error?

Isn't -- wasn't that your answer? And doesn't that show that Congress, although it generally conferred on district courts the authority under those provisions to determine what is a reasonable sentence in light of the enumerated factors, withdrew that discretion with respect to the component that is covered by 924(c)? So if that's what the -- if that's what Congress was doing, then why shouldn't that entire sentence be ruled out in determining the sentence that is reasonable under the count that is not governed by 924(c)?

So any interlocutory order could then -- could then be appealed. Well, what -- what -- -- would be the definition of a ruling -- well, what is decimate the merits? What does that mean? It is odd that the panel that decided the case, finally decided the case, apparently thought that this -- there was a proper ground for this to go forward as a class -- as a class action, right?

The panel -- the -- the final decision of the Ninth Circuit was that there had been an error by the district court regarding -- -- class action certification. No. That -- I -- I understand all that.

But -- and you've spoken a lot about Ninth Circuit precedent.

Well, it's one thing when a party who suffered a very serious adverse ruling on an interlocutory order says: Okay, we give up; go ahead and enter judgment for the other side. That's one thing. It's quite another thing, possibly, when the party that has suffered this ruling moves for a voluntary dismissal. An order cannot be final unless it defeats every thing that you asked for.

Well, if -- I mean, if -- this isn't the issue that we -- that we took cert to decide, but it does raise the question whether there's really anything at stake here.

And in a way, it seemed to me that what was being debated in the district court was the wrong issue about whether to charge the jury on materiality, because materiality is not in this statute. But as you have refined the argument, the issue is the meaning of the term ""procure"" -- -- which may or may not mean exactly the same thing as ""materiality."" Within your brief, you, I -- I think, have possibly tried to read more into ""procure"" than you can, because in a number of spots you seem -- you argued that it means ""but for causation."" Now, this morning you have said that's not your argument. It's not -- you don't have to prove that, but for the -- the false statement in the immigration proceeding, the person would not have been naturalized. Well, I -- I don't know whether you can get that out of ""procured."" Let me give you this example. Let's say there is a -- a municipal ordinance that says that it is illegal to buy or sell a scalp's ticket within 200 feet of the entrance of a stadium or a concert hall, and I buy -- knowingly buy a scalped ticket within 199 feet of the entrance of this facility. Now, in order for me to have procured that ticket contrary to law, would it be necessary to prove that I couldn't have purchased this from another scalper around the other side who was outside of the 200 feet, or I couldn't have gotten a ticket if I had waited in line at the box office?

I mean, you can say it should be but-for but I -- I'll win if it's anything. What is your -- do you have a firm position or -- Well, that's -- I mean, that's awfully hard, because then you have to go back and determine, even if somebody says something that has a real potential to affect the naturalization decision, you still would have to go back and show that in this case it actually did make the difference. That's the same question. It may be the same question in a -- in a different form. Just give me a sentence that has this pattern. Jane Doe procured something. Jane Doe procured X contrary to law, where the thing that she procured had no potential -- I'm sorry -- where the thing that she did had no potential to help her get X.

2016,"Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer",112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Mr. Cortman, do we know what Missouri -- how Missouri interprets the term ""church"" in its constitution? It speaks about church. Does it have to be -- is this a matter of the form of the ownership of a facility? Is this playground considered to be -- by the State to be part of the church because of its proximity to the church? What if it was a -- what if we had a -- a religiously affiliated school that was not adjacent to a church and it had a playground. Would they consider that to be part of -- would they consider that to fall within the prohibition? So if it's controlled. And Mr. Cortman, I don't know whether we -- excuse me. I don't know whether we need to get into the history of this particular amendment here. I tend to think we don't need to, but at the beginning of the line of questioning that Justice Sotomayor just finished, she began with the suggestion that perhaps this amendment reflects an admirable historical tradition that should be respected. Do you think that that is the proper way to analyze this question? Well, Mr. Layton, you said you don't want to -- you don't want to have a program that makes physical improvements to -- to churches. And I just wanted to ask you about some Federal laws that are highlighted in the amicus brief filed by the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations, and get your reaction whether a program like that would be permissible under the Missouri constitution. So one of them is a Federal nonprofit security grant program providing grants through the Department of Homeland Security to harden -- harden nonprofit organization facilities that are deemed to be at high risk for terrorist attacks. So if you have a -- a synagogue that is at high risk for an attack by an anti-Semitic group or a mosque that is considered to be at high risk for attack by an anti-Muslim group, would the Missouri constitution permit the erection of bollards like we have around the court here? Okay. Here's another one. I have two more, if you'll indulge me. This is a Federal program that provided grants for the repair of buildings near the Federal building in Oklahoma City that were damaged by the bombing there. Would that be permitted? Okay. Last one. This is a New York City program that provides security -- money for security enhancements at schools where there's fear of shooting or other school violence. So what is the definition of a church? So a religiously-affiliated school is not a church under the -- under the Missouri constitution? But why -- Why would that be so? Oh. So suppose you -- we have the -- a school that's run by the Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia. And then next to it we have a -- a Jesuit elementary and secondary school. One would be eligible, one would not be eligible? But even though they're equally controlled by a religious organizations? And -- and so long as the money is granted based on neutral criteria that are faithfully applied, I don't know how you can draw a distinction between a program that's open to everybody and a selective program. I mean, suppose Missouri offered 50 full college scholarships every year to students who achieved certain academic criteria -- who satisfied certain academic criteria, and this was open to public school students and private school students. But, you know, after a few years, the school saw -- the State saw that a disproportionate number of these were going -- among those given to the religiously affiliate, to the private schools, a disproportionate were -- a number of the scholarships were going to students at schools that are affiliated with a particular faith. Would it be, then, justified to say, well, we better not -- we better disqualify every student who went to a religiously affiliated school so there aren't any hard feelings? So what's the difference between that situation and this situation -- -- as far as the difference between selective and nonselective? No. I'm not talking about equal protection. You -- you said there's -- that it matters that this is selective as opposed to not selective. And what is the basis for drawing that distinction? I thought that -- I thought your asserted basis was it prevents the perception of favoritism.

2016,Matal v. Tam,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Substantial First Amendment issue.

Do you deny that trademarks are used for expressive purposes? I -- I wonder if you are not stretching this, the -- the concept of a government program, past the breaking point. The government provides lots of services to the general public. And I don't think you would say that those fall within the government program line of cases that you're talking about, like providing police protection to the general public or providing fire protection to the general public. Those cost money and those are government programs. Can the government say, well, we're going to provide protection for some groups, but not for other groups? Mr. Connell, don't you think that Congress could deny a trademark registration for something that fit within the narrow, historically recognized category of libel and slander which have never been regarded as having First Amendment protection? I want to come back to the -- the Chief Justice's question. I really have difficulty separating the expressive from the commercial aspect of a trademark. Let me give you an example. I think that Nike's phrase ""Just Do It"" is a registered trademark. Now, is that commercial or is that expressive? Well, if they're inexplicably intertwined, then I -- I don't understand how we can separate them and apply to the expressive part a more rigorous test than we would apply to the commercial part. All right. Do you think that viewpoint discrimination is always prohibited in commercial speech? For example, could the government say -- and maybe it already has said -- that a manufacturer of cigarettes could not place on a package of cigarettes ""Great for your health. Don't believe the surgeon general""? Mr. Stewart, you really think that speech can be restricted by the government on the ground that foreign countries may object to it? Could -- could the government do that with copyright? I mean, an awful lot of things are copyrighted in this country that are deeply offensive to some foreign countries, and yet, the FBI enforces the copyright laws.

2016,Davila v. Davis,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","What concerns me about your position is that it seems to blast an enormous hole in the doctrine of procedural default. Unlike Martinez and unlike Trevino, which were cabined, it -- it seems to me, and you'll correct me if I'm wrong, that if we agree with your position, then anything that -- that an attorney in Federal habeas can examine the trial record, and if that attorney finds anything that seems to be an error, it can be raised in Federal habeas, even if there was no objection at the time of trial, it wasn't raised on direct appeal, it wasn't raised in a State collateral proceeding. That's where this is going. And if it's an -- if the underlying error is ineffective assistance of counsel, well, whatever it is, all of that will be evaluated by the Federal habeas court outside of AEDPA. That's where this is going. So this is an enormous hole. Am I not -- isn't that where this -- isn't that what this means? Because the -- the argument in Federal habeas would be there was cause because counsel was ineffective at the collateral -- State collateral proceeding, and this counsel was ineffective at the State collateral proceeding because there was ineffective assistance on direct appeal. And then counsel on direct appeal was ineffective because there was an error at trial. So the Federal habeas court has to make all of those determinations, and if the court -- the -- which means the court is going to have to look at whether or not there was an error at trial and, in doing that, it is not going to be asking whether a -- whether a State court reasonably rejected the claim because it was never presented to the State court. So it's going to be de novo review. Well, they'd have to find something that they can argue in the Federal habeas was an error, but procedural default would be out the window. Right. And the Federal habeas court is going to have to analyze that, which means the Federal habeas court is going to have to analyze all of these alleged trial errors that were never previously raised in the State court. But Martinez concerned ineffective assistance of counsel in a limited number of States, and Trevino arguably extended it to a few additional States. But if we accept your argument, it applies everywhere, and it's not limited to ineffective assistance of counsel. It is -- it applies to every single -- every single type of error that could occur at trial. Yeah. But the ineffective assistance of appellate counsel would be based on any type of error that occurred at trial. So here you have a jury instruction error. But if we agree with you, it would apply to the erroneous introduction of evidence, to the -- to improper statements made in closing, to any type of trial error, any type of constitutional trial error you can dream of. So whatever the statistics are on Martinez, this goes way, way, way beyond Martinez. And Trevino. Why will it be a small thing? If you can identify looking back that there was an objection that should have been granted, and it might have -- might have led to a different result at trial but it wasn't raised on direct appeal, then there's going to be ineffective assistance of -- of appellate counsel.

Well, could you address that? We -- we had a similar issue a few terms ago in the Flores-Villar case, but that was a criminal -- there, what was at issue was a criminal conviction. Here, criminal convictions are not at issue. The criminal convictions had nothing to do with alienage; is that correct? The underlying criminal convictions.

And if such a person were to then bring a suit, they would have a strong equal protection claim, would they not? Well, that is true, but isn't it something else when we devise a remedy that deepens and extends an equal protection violation? Have we ever done that? Well, it would be a legitimacy discrimination. The -- the laws that are -- what are they subject to, and the case -- the past cases have involved discrimination against the children of unwed parents. And what has -- what is the standard of review there? And have we ever said there would be a different level of scrutiny if the discrimination was against children who were born to married parents? Would you make that argument? Yeah. But to children who are born to unmarried mothers, but not to children who are born to unmarried fathers, and you would extend the problem. You would have this Court extend the problem. And you think that was Congress' intent in 1952? In 1940 you think that was Congress' intent.

2016,Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Suppose that there were no -- that the definition here -- the phrase here had no criminal application. So it applies purely in immigration; okay? And you're not asking us to overrule Chevron. All right. So why wouldn't this phrase, ""sexual abuse of a minor,"" be a phrase that is sufficiently ambiguous to justify Chevron? Now, in order to get around that, do you have to invoke something like the rule of lenity? So that -- that is not an ambiguous phrase by itself, ""sexual abuse of a minor""? But you think that if we look at this incredible array of State laws, it becomes clear what Congress intended by ""sexual abuse of a minor""? Can I take you back to the -- the argument that Chevron isn't appropriate here because the definition applies in both the criminal and the civil context? And that was the point that Judge Sutton made in his dissent, and it has kind of a -- it's an appealing argument when you say it fast. But the more I think of it, the less sense -- (Laughter.) -- the less sense it makes. Now suppose that a -- there's an ambiguous phrase in an immigration statute, and it applies only in the civil -- it applies only in immigration and has no criminal -- has no criminal applications. And suppose that in that situation it would be appropriate to use Chevron, okay, and then later Congress uses the same phrase in a criminal statute. Does that mean that the Chevron deference that was applied in the civil -- previously in the civil context goes away? I -- I don't see anything odd about having the same phrase interpreted using a different methodology in a civil case and in a criminal case. Well -- but I would like to know why it makes sense, so something other than a citation of cases, why would Chevron deference be appropriate up to the point where Congress decides to use the same phrase in a criminal statute and then it disappears. And this quest for the -- the generic offense of sexual abuse of a minor seems to me to be a -- a meaningless quest. There's no ""there"" there. It's not like burglary where there's a common law definition. You've got some core. This is a phrase that doesn't have a common law counterpart. And if you look at all these State statutes and throw in all the Federal statutes that you can find that have some relation to this, what you have is a -- a big array of very disparate statutes. So this seems to me like a classic example of Congress saying, we have this category sexual abuse of a minor, and we know that there's all this array of State laws. And so you, Attorney General, define what should be within this for immigration purposes. Is it your understanding anything other than -- if a stranger does anything to a minor other than commit a rape, then that would not be sexual abuse of a minor because the person wouldn't be a relative or an acquaintance? I thought your definition was it had to be a relative -- parent, relative, or acquaintance; is that right? ",suppose that there we be no that the definition here the phrase here have no criminal application so it apply purely in immigration okay and you be not ask us to overrule chevron all right so why would not this phrase sexual abuse of a minor be a phrase that be sufficiently ambiguous to justify chevron now in order to get around that do you have to invoke something like the rule of lenity so that that be not an ambiguous phrase by itself sexual abuse of a minor but you think that if we look at this incredible array of state law it become clear what congress intend by sexual abuse of a minor can i take you back to the the argument that chevron be not appropriate here because the definition applies in both the criminal and the civil context and that be the point that judge sutton make in his dissent and it have kind of a it be an appeal argument when you say it fast but the more i think of it the less sense laughter the less sense it make now suppose that a there be an ambiguous phrase in an immigration statute and it apply only in the civil it apply only in immigration and have no criminal have no criminal application and suppose that in that situation it would be appropriate to use chevron okay and then later congress use the same phrase in a criminal statute do that mean that the chevron deference that be apply in the civil previously in the civil context go away i i do not see anything odd about have the same phrase interpret use a different methodology in a civil case and in a criminal case well but i would like to know why it make sense so something other than a citation of case why would chevron deference be appropriate up to the point where congress decide to use the same phrase in a criminal statute and then it disappear and this quest for the the generic offense of sexual abuse of a minor seem to me to be a a meaningless quest there be no there there it be not like burglary where there be a common law definition you have get some core this be a phrase that do not have a common law counterpart and if you look at all these state statute and throw in all the federal statute that you can find that have some relation to this what you have be a a big array of very disparate statute so this seem to me like a classic example of congress say we have this category sexual abuse of a minor and we know that there be all this array of state law and so you attorney general define what should be within this for immigration purpose be it your understand anything other than if a stranger do anything to a minor other than commit a rape then that would not be sexual abuse of a minor because the person would not be a relative or an acquaintance i think your definition be it have to be a relative parent relative or acquaintance be that right ,192.43,Roberts Court,"Feb 27, 2017",Juan Esquivel-Quintana,"Jefferson B.

2016,Turner v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","The alternative perpetrator theory does seem completely inconsistent with the defenses that were put on at trial. I -- I'm not sure how you can say that they could have used both. But in order to convince the jury to accept the alternative perpetrator theory, wouldn't it have been necessary to convince the jury that Alston and Bard pled guilty and were sentenced to substantial prison sentences for crimes that they didn't participate in at all, and that all of the other witnesses who described this group attack, including at least one who doesn't seem to have the -- the 14-year-old boy, who doesn't seem to have impeachment evidence, were perjuring themselves on the stand. That -- that's a pretty substantial burden to overcome, isn't it? But even so, wouldn't it still be difficult to explain how Thomas came up with a theory that would be a complete fabrication. It's not just a -- wouldn't be just a question that he was mistaken about things, or he might have exaggerated or something like that. It would be a complete fabrication with no obvious motive. Wouldn't that be true? Well, lawyers are used to arguing in the alternative, but other people are not. And I -- it's really hard to see how the -- the defense argument could be: This was -- this crime was committed by McMillan and another, and a confederate of his; but if you don't believe that, it was committed by the group, but I wasn't part of the group. That's really hard to -- to do that; isn't it? Okay. Could I ask you a kind of a picky question that relates to the Watts/Luchie evidence. Part of the argument there is that only one or two people could fit in the garage, but I don't see -- why would that be so? If it's big enough for a car, it's big enough for more than one or two people. What about the attack that Mr. Williams described? The McMillan's attack on the council woman.

Well, in the Third Circuit oral argument, it was said over and over, well, we just want to make sure that the law is filed -- is followed. That's what we are interested in. Isn't that right? If you were pressed as to what practical difference the case meant to you and -- and the answer was, we -- you know, we want to uphold the law. But can you point to anything you said in the Third Circuit, in writing or orally, that -- along those lines, that you -- that there was some practical course of action that -- that you -- some tangible thing that you were going to pursue? Can I ask one other -- one other thing? Something strange seems to have happened between the petition stage and the briefing stage in the case. The question that you asked us to take was whether a bankruptcy court may authorize the distribution of settlement proceeds in a manner that violates the statutory priority scheme. And you said there's a square conflict on that issue, with the Second Circuit and the Third Circuit on one side and the Fifth Circuit on the other side. And we took the case. But then the question that you address in your brief refers to ""structured dismissal."" There is nothing about structured dismissal in the question that you asked us to take, and there is no conflict on the question of structured dismissal, is there? Now, you're not asking us to decide the broad question whether there can ever be a structured dismissal. But you are asking us to decide whether the priorities have to be followed in a structural dismissal, and unless the answer to that question follows from the answer to the question that you presented in your petition, you have changed the question that you have asked us to decide. You're saying that -- that there can never be a distribution of estate assets except in compliance with the priorities? One which -- that's not what you just said? What would be your principal basis for distinguishing the exception that Ms. Spinelli outlined at the end of her argument from what happened here? I thought your argument was that the priority scheme applies to everything that happens in a Chapter 7 and a Chapter 11. Ms. Harrington -- Yeah, if I could just -- go ahead. There is another logically prior question. And I don't know what you -- what do you think we should do with the question of whether the bankruptcy court has to approve settlements at all? There is nothing in the Code that says that they have to. What -- What is your response to the argument that your argument regarding Section 103(a) makes the provisions that specifically make the priorities applicable in Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 superfluous? So those are just exception provisions?

2016,Beckles v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, what if the -- the Guidelines themselves said that the term ""crime of violence"" means, among other things, burglary of a dwelling, arson, extortion, involves use of explosives, involves possession of a sawed-off shotgun, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another? Would there be a vagueness problem then? But the Guidelines provisions are the -- are the Commission's words. Now, they borrowed them from a statute, but they didn't have to do that? But they did. So they -- they were their words, and they interpreted their words in the commentary. Let me ask you a more -- let me ask you a more fundamental question. And I don't want to unduly shock the attorneys who are here from the Sentencing Commission, but imagine there were no sentencing guidelines. So you have a criminal provision that says that a person who's convicted of this offense may be imprisoned for not more than 20 years. That's all it says. Now, is that unconstitutionally vague? Well, that seems to be a lot -- a lot vaguer than what we have here. So how do you -- how do you reconcile those two propositions? Are you saying there's more arbitrariness under this provision than there was under the pre-Sentencing Reform Act sentencing system, where a judge would pick a sentence between zero and 20 years based on that judge's personal ideas about retribution, deterrence, and incapacitation? And in practice, there were judges who, under that system, always imposed a very light sentence for a particular offense and other judges who always imposed a heavy sentence for that particular offense. If I go through the Sentencing Guidelines -- I mean, I just opened them at random. I can see provisions that would generate a -- you know, an arguable vagueness challenge if they were in a criminal statute. How about more than minimal planning? Do you think that's sufficiently -- that that's sufficiently clear to satisfy vagueness concerns if, you know, you're -- you're guilty of this offense if it involved more than minimal planning? Or the difference between a serious bodily injury and a permanent or life-threatening bodily injury? And those are just -- I mean, just open this at random. So basically, your argument is that there's a continuum, so that if you have complete judicial discretion, barring the consideration of some impermissible invidious factor, within the statutory guideline range, there's no vagueness problem. On the other hand, if you have mandatory guidelines, you may have to apply vagueness principles to the mandatory guidelines. Now, here it -- so someplace in the middle you get -- you are close enough to the mandatory that that has to apply. That's -- that's your argument? Well, if advisory guidelines are subject to vagueness challenges, then surely mandatory guidelines would be subject to vagueness -- All right. So it's for vagueness purposes. Now, suppose what the Court had said is the Guidelines are purely advisory. Now, you know, they're -- the Sentencing Commission, very respected group, studied the problem; judges, you really ought to read them, you ought to take them into account, but in the end, it's your call, based on the factors that are set out in the Sentencing Reform Act. Would the result be the same? But what will happen ten years from now? Let's say ten years from now when you have -- there's no district judge anymore who even remembers the mandatory guideline regime and there are departures in 85 percent of the cases, and the judges go through the drill. They -- you know, they calculate the Guidelines and all of that, but then they go on and impose the type of sentence that they think adequately serves the legitimate purposes of sentencing. Would your argument be the same then? That's like jurisdiction, that we are bound, we have no choice but to decide retroactivity before deciding anything else. Well, if I think that it's retroactive, should I stop there, should I go on to consider whether it's vague, or should I just accept your concession that it's vague? ",well what if the the guideline themselves say that the term crime of violence mean among other thing burglary of a dwelling arson extortion involve use of explosive involve possession of a saw off shotgun or otherwise involve conduct that present a serious potential risk of physical injury to another would there be a vagueness problem then but the guideline provision be the be the commission s word now they borrow them from a statute but they do not have to do that but they do so they they we be their word and they interpret their word in the commentary let me ask you a more let me ask you a more fundamental question and i do not want to unduly shock the attorney who be here from the sentence commission but imagine there we be no sentence guideline so you have a criminal provision that say that a person who be convict of this offense may be imprison for not more than year that be all it say now be that unconstitutionally vague well that seem to be a lot a lot vaguer than what we have here so how do you how do you reconcile those two proposition be you say there be more arbitrariness under this provision than there be under the pre sentence reform act sentence system where a judge would pick a sentence between zero and year base on that judge s personal idea about retribution deterrence and incapacitation and in practice there we be judge who under that system always impose a very light sentence for a particular offense and other judge who always impose a heavy sentence for that particular offense if i go through the sentence guideline i mean i just open them at random i can see provision that would generate a you know an arguable vagueness challenge if they we be in a criminal statute how about more than minimal planning do you think that be sufficiently that that be sufficiently clear to satisfy vagueness concern if you know you be you be guilty of this offense if it involve more than minimal planning or the difference between a serious bodily injury and a permanent or life threaten bodily injury and those be just i mean just open this at random so basically your argument be that there be a continuum so that if you have complete judicial discretion bar the consideration of some impermissible invidious factor within the statutory guideline range there have no vagueness problem on the other hand if you have mandatory guideline you may have to apply vagueness principle to the mandatory guideline now here it so someplace in the middle you get you be close enough to the mandatory that that have to apply that be that be your argument well if advisory guideline be subject to vagueness challenge then surely mandatory guideline would be subject to vagueness all right so it be for vagueness purpose now suppose what the court have say be the guideline be purely advisory now you know they be the sentence commission very respected group study the problem judge you really ought to read them you ought to take them into account but in the end it be your call base on the factor that be set out in the sentencing reform act would the result be the same but what will happen ten year from now let us say ten year from now when you have there be no district judge anymore who even remember the mandatory guideline regime and there be departure in percent of the case and the judge go through the drill they you know they calculate the guideline and all of that but then they go on and impose the type of sentence that they think adequately serve the legitimate purpose of sentence would your argument be the same then that be like jurisdiction that we be bind we have no choice but to decide retroactivity before decide anything else well if i think that it be retroactive should i stop there should i go on to consider whether it be vague or should i just accept your concession that it be vague ,260.97,Roberts Court,"Nov 28, 2016",Travis Beckles,United States,15-8544,"Jun 27, 2016","Mar 6, 2017",112,0.0,1.0,0.0,0
2017,Minnesota Voters Alliance v. Mansky,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, suppose we think that it would be a different case and that a state could have a law that prohibits the wearing of buttons or any other -- or attire that contains the name of a candidate or refers to a ballot issue or the name of a political party that has candidates running for office in that election. If we thought that that would be consistent with the First Amendment, would that doom your case or would you still have additional arguments? Have we ever said that it would be permissible to ban all political speech on military ground? How many other states have laws that go as far as Minnesota's? And what has been the experience of these other cases -- these other states? Have they had brawls in the -- in the polling place? Have they had disturbances in the polling place? Well, the states that don't have laws that go as far as Minnesota's, what -- what has been the record there? And does the record show how many officials would be making these determinations at a general election in Minnesota and how they're selected? Yeah, the polling officials. So they're selected by the parties. So, if a -- an official from one party thinks that the attire of a particular voter violates this law, what happens? That's the final decision? And who -- I'm sorry. And who selects the head election judge at any particular place? Well, I'll ask -- I guess I'll ask the state. Do you know whether these -- these people have any training? Are they all chosen to be the reasonable observer? Do they, you know, test them to see if they're -- they're the reasonable observer? Do we know? The problem is that so many things have political connotations, and the connotations are in the eye of the beholder. And on Election Day, you're going to have hundreds, maybe thousands of officials in Minnesota, and every one of them probably thinks that he or she is the reasonable observer, and they're making a determination about whether something has political connotations. And in one of your elections, in 2016, I think, you had -- the President was running, members of the House were running, members of the State Legislature were running, State Judges were running. There were local elections. There was one ballot question. So the observer would have to know all of the issues in all of those campaigns and would have to decide whether something had connotations regarding any of those issues. It's -- it's an invitation for arbitrary and -- arbitrary enforcement and enforcement that's not even-handed. And I -- I have no idea where the line lies. Some of the examples that were raised in the Eighth Circuit were really pretty -- and -- and the state said, yes, that would be prohibited. An AFL-CIO shirt, that would be prohibited? Yeah. Well, that makes it worse, that it has to be -- well, it's not only does it have to be a political message, but it has to be well-known. What -- what is well-known? How about a shirt with a rainbow flag? Would that be permitted? How about a shirt that says ""Parkland Strong""? Even though gun control would very likely be an issue? I bet some candidate would raise an issue about gun control. Well, what's the answer to this question? You're a polling official. You're the reasonable person. Would that be allowed or would it not be allowed? Yeah. Okay. How about an NRA shirt? How about a shirt with the text of the Second Amendment? How about the First Amendment? (Laughter.) Yeah, well, this is the problem. How about a Colin Kaepernick jersey? How about ""All Lives Matter""? How about an ""I Miss Bill"" shirt? (Laughter.) An ""I Miss Bill,"" or to make it bipartisan, a ""Reagan/Bush '84"" shirt? I mean, people go to vote after work, before work, in the middle of doing chores for the day, taking kids to school. So somebody goes to the polling place and is wearing a shirt, doesn't say anything about a candidate or a ballot issue, but a particular election judge, one of these people picked by one of the two parties, says, oh, that's political, you -- so now this person has a choice. The person can wear a bathrobe or some kind of coverup to go in and vote. You think that's not kind of humiliating? Or the person can be listed as a bad Minnesotan and, at some point down the road, potentially fined $300, found to have committed a petty offense. That's the situation, right? You -- You exacerbate that problem by opening up the possibility of similarly partisan or seemingly partisan applications of your very broad statute. All right. How is that going to happen? So let's say the -- there's an election judge who's a Republican and this Republican election judge thinks that a particular shirt has political connotations and says, no, you can't go in; you've got to wear -- you've got to cover yourself up or go home and get changed. Okay? And now that person thinks that's unfair. Then what happens? A Democrat -- a Democratic judge intervenes and then you have a -- you have an argument between these two judges? And who's the head election judge? Let me ask you about one of the interests that you assert in your brief, and this is on page 46 of your brief. ""A voter could well feel confused or intimidated if she walked into a polling place and discovered that every other voter held the opposite point of view on any number of controversial political issues related to electoral choices, as evidenced by the political messages displayed on other voters' apparel."" Do you think that's a compelling state interest? Do you think that's even a legitimate state interest? Now how would an as-applied challenge work on -- on Election Day? You're not going to have an as-applied challenge when somebody goes to vote. Suppose a group of people want to make a statement about a political issue, not a political candidate but a political issue, and they say we're going to do that by wearing all white on Election Day when we go to the polls. Would that be allowed? That doesn't express a view on a political issue? So, if a shirt has ""#metoo"" that would be allowed or not allowed? So if people want -- So -- so, if a group said, well, okay, we're not going to be able to wear our -- our ""Me Too"" shirt, but we're going to convey the same message by wearing all white, that would be okay? ",well suppose we think that it would be a different case and that a state could have a law that prohibit the wearing of button or any other or attire that contain the name of a candidate or refers to a ballot issue or the name of a political party that have candidate run for office in that election if we think that that would be consistent with the first amendment would that doom your case or

what have be the experience of these other case these other state have they have brawl in the in the polling place have they have disturbance in the polling place well the state that do not have law that go as far as minnesota s what what have be the record there and do the record show how many official would be make these determination at a general election in minnesota and how they be select yeah the polling official so they be select by the party so if a an official from one party think that the attire of a particular voter violate this law what happen that be the final decision and who I be sorry and who select the head election judge at any particular place well I will ask i guess I will ask the state do you know whether these these people have any training be they all choose to be

the eye of the beholder and on election day you be go to have hundred maybe thousand of official in minnesota and every one of them probably think that he or she be the reasonable observer and they be make a determination about whether something have political connotation and in one of your election in i think you have the president be run member of the house we be run member of the state

bathrobe or some kind of coverup to go in and vote you think that be not kind of humiliating or the person can be list as a bad minnesotan and at some point down the road potentially fin find to have commit a petty offense that be the situation right you you exacerbate that problem by open up the possibility of similarly partisan or seemingly partisan application of your very broad statute all right how be that go to happen so let us say the there be an election judge who be a republican and this republican election judge think that a particular shirt have political connotation and say no you can not go in you have get to wear you have get to cover yourself up or go home and get change okay and now that person think that be unfair then what happen a democrat a democratic judge intervenes and then you have a you have an argument between these two judge and who be the head election judge let me ask you about one of the interest that you assert in your brief and this be on page of your brief a voter could well feel confuse or intimidate if she walk into a polling place and discover that every other voter hold the opposite point of view on any number of controversial political issue relate to electoral choice as evidence by the political message display on other voter apparel do you think that be a compelling state interest do you think that be even a legitimate state interest now how would an as applied challenge work on on election day you be not go to have an as applied challenge when somebody go to vote suppose a group of people want to make a statement about a political issue not a political candidate but a political issue and they say we be go to do that by wear all white on election day when we go to the poll would that be allow that do not express a view on a political issue so if a shirt have metoo that would be allow or not allow so if people want so so if a group say well okay we be not go to be able to wear our our me too shirt but

2017,McCoy v. Louisiana,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Your answer is that -- this is fairly simple. The -- the defense attorney cannot concede any element of the defense -- of -- of the offense. Now, Mr. Waxman -- Mr. Waxman, let me -- Well, could I ask you about -- Mr. Waxman, could I ask you about, because I want to understand where the -- the line is here. So let's imagine a case where the evidence of the actus reus is overwhelming, there's not a chance in the world that the defense is going to be able to convince a jury that the defendant did not commit the actus reus, but there's a plausible defense, maybe a pretty good defense, on mens rea. So -- but the client insists: I didn't do it, I did not commit the actus reus. Now, two ways of -- of approaching this on the part of the defendant -- defense attorney, and I want you to explain whether one is required or whether -- whether both are permissible or only one is permissible. One is for the attorney to concede in the opening, yes, he committed the actus reus, but there's a good mens rea defense, and develop that. I take it you would say that's not permissible? But could the attorney open by saying: Now, they have to prove he committed certain acts but also that he had a certain mental state, and our defense here is going to be that he didn't have the requisite mental state, and everything that's done during the trial is directed toward that. There's no attempt to put the government to its proof, to try to poke holes in the witnesses who are going to be called to establish the actus reus. Is the latter permitted? So long as he doesn't say the magic words he actually committed the -- the -- the physical acts charged, it's okay? I -- I understand that. I -- I -- I -- I understand your -- I understand -- -- your position, but what is the answer -- I want to understand where the line is. What is the answer to my question? But you were drawing -- At that time -- No, go ahead. Well, in -- when the Sixth Amendment was adopted, there was not a right to appointed counsel. So I imagine that somebody in Mr. English's position would simply say: I'm not going to be part of this farce that you want to put on. I'm just withdrawing. And Mr. McCoy would be -- would either have to come up with another attorney very quickly or go ahead without an attorney. So I don't know -- -- how much you can read into the -- into the original understanding because the situation here is dictated -- is dominated by the fact that now there is the right to have an appointed attorney. But -- When we got to this -- -- we got to this -- -- the situation here occurred. It's an extreme situation, and a -- and a difficult one -- but it -- it only occurred because of a number of prior steps, many of which I think are debatable. One, the -- the -- the decision that McCoy is competent to handle -- to stand trial. The second, the -- the judge's ruling, I understand the reason, that English couldn't withdraw. The decision that there couldn't be a continuance so that McCoy could find another attorney, if he could find one who would put on his far-fetched alibi defense. And McCoy's refusal to waive his right to counsel and represent himself. Now, if any of those had gone differently, the situation wouldn't have been presented. So what about the issue of -- what about the issue of competence and allowing English to withdraw? If a -- if somebody like McCoy really sincerely believes that he did not commit these physical acts, but it was all done by -- as part of an elaborate conspiracy, is he -- is he capable of assisting in his own defense? All right. If I could -- -- just move on to the -- the other part of it. So, if English says to the judge, look, Your Honor, I can't be part of -- and I don't want to be part of this farce, it -- and this farce that has the predictable result of sending this -- my client to a death sentence, I want to withdraw, why shouldn't the judge let him withdraw? ",your answer be that this be fairly simple the the defense attorney can not concede any element of the defense of of the offense now mr waxman mr waxman let me well could i ask you about mr waxman could i ask you about because i want to understand where the the line be here so let us imagine a case where the evidence of the actus reus be overwhelming there be not a chance in the world that the defense be go to be able to convince a jury that the defendant do not commit the actus reus but there be a plausible defense maybe a pretty good defense on men rea so but the client insist i do not do it i do not commit the actus reus now two way of of approach this on the part of the defendant defense attorney and i want you to explain whether one be require or whether whether both be permissible or only one be permissible one be for the attorney to concede in the opening yes he commit the actus reus but there be a good men rea defense and develop that i take it you would say that be not permissible but could the attorney open by say now they have to prove he commit certain act but also that he have a certain mental state and our defense here be go to be that he do not have the requisite mental state and everything that be do during the trial be direct toward that there be no attempt to put the government to its proof to try to poke hole in the witness who be go to be call to establish the actus reus be the latter permit so long as he do not say the magic word he actually commit the the the physical act charge it be okay i i understand that i i i i understand your i understand your position but what be the answer i want to understand where the line be what be the answer to my question but you we be draw at that time no go ahead well in when the sixth amendment be adopt there be not a right to appoint counsel so i imagine that somebody in mr english s position would simply say I be not go to be part of this farce that you want to put on I be just withdrawing and mr mccoy would be would either have to come up with another attorney very quickly or go ahead without an attorney so i do not know how much you can read into the into the original understanding because the situation here be dictate be dominate by the fact that now there be the right to have an appoint attorney but when we get to this we get to this the situation here occur it be an extreme situation and a and a difficult one but it it only occur because of a number of prior step many of which i think be debatable one the the the decision that mccoy be competent to handle to stand trial the second the the judge s ruling i understand the reason that english could not withdraw the decision that there could not be a continuance so that mccoy could find another attorney if he could find one who would put on his far fetch alibi defense and mccoy s refusal to waive his right to counsel and represent himself now if any of those have go differently the situation would not have be present so what about the issue of what about the issue of competence and allow english to withdraw if a if somebody like mccoy really sincerely believe that he do not commit these physical act but it be all do by as part of an elaborate conspiracy be he be he capable of assist in his own defense all right if i could just move on to the the other part of it so if english say to the judge look your honor i can not be part of and i do not want to be part of this farce it and this farce that have the predictable result of send this my client to a death sentence i want to withdraw why should not the judge let him withdraw ,248.48000000000005,Roberts Court,"Jan 17, 2018",Robert McCoy,State of Louisiana,16-8255,"Sep 28, 2017","May 14, 2018",112,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

The districts in both are compact. The territory is contiguous.

Now, in your view, that's unconstitutional, I gather? Yes. The answer to my question is yes?

2017,Ayestas v. Davis,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Could I ask you a question about the jurisdictional issue that your adversary has raised? Do you think that appellate courts have jurisdiction over disputes about the amount of funding? And what would those circumstances be? So any -- any time there's a -- that the attorney is dissatisfied with the amount of funding, I assume, that would mean that there could be an appeal? Yeah. Well, that's -- that was the situation I had in mind. So the attorney asks for $20,000 to investigate and the court grants $5,000 to investigate. There could be an appeal about that? I mean, what about -- I'm sorry. I mean, one other jurisdictional question. Is it true that the director of the Administrative Office of the Courts can under some circumstances review a funding grant, and, if that is so, how can the funding grant be the exercise of judicial power? Well, I would think the most relevant language is the language of the statute, ""reasonably necessary."" And I really struggled with that, and also with the phrase ""substantial need."" But taking ""reasonably necessary,"" if it just said necessary, that would be a pretty tough standard. Would you accept the interpretation of reasonably necessary to mean that this is something that a reasonable attorney would think is necessary? But the -- but the attorney, the reasonable attorney still has to think that it is necessary, which is pretty tough. Unless necessary doesn't mean necessary. It's like the necessary and proper clause. It doesn't mean that it's really necessary. (Laughter.) You really know what they were thinking? (Laughter.) Okay. What is the difference between ""reasonably necessary"" and ""substantial need""? I have been racking my brain trying to think of something that it is reasonably necessary for me to obtain but as to which I do not have a substantial need. And I can't think of an example. Maybe you can give me an example. No don't -- - no, don't do that, because one is the statutory language and the other is the language that's used by the Fifth Circuit. And that's what we have to deal with, no matter what the various courts of appeals have said about this. Yeah, okay. All right. Well, picking up on what Justice Breyer just said and trying this one last time, I thought the issue that we had agreed to decide was whether the Fifth Circuit's formulation of ""substantial need"" is different from ""reasonably necessary,"" which is the statutory standard. And I still don't understand what the difference is between those two formulations. It seems possibly like just a matter of words. So explain to me what is the difference between those -- those two formulations? Right. Would a reasonable lawyer think it's necessary? Right. Why? I mean, if you have -- if it's a reasonable attorney -- you know, reasonably necessary, would a reasonable attorney think there was a substantial need for it? It -- it just -- it seems to me like you're not really arguing the question that we granted. You're -- what you're saying is that if we take a look at everything that the Fifth Circuit's been doing in this area in lots of cases that are not before us, it's not doing the right thing. That seems to be your argument. Not that there really is a difference between these two verbal formulations. A reasonable attorney with finite means might devote those finite means to an avenue of investigation that has very, very little chance of success because there is so much at stake. So I don't understand how that can be the test here, where the statutory language is reasonably necessary. That seems clearly -- whatever necessary means, it -- it means some degree of importance. It has -- the evidence has to be -- has to meet some level of importance in order for the standard to be met. I don't see how you can get around it. And to say the test is whether -- what would a reasonable attorney with finite means do, I -- it seems to me quite meaningless. And I thought you agreed with that standard. ",could i ask you a question about the jurisdictional issue that your adversary have raise do you think that appellate court have jurisdiction over dispute about the amount of funding and what would those circumstance be so any any time there be a that the attorney be dissatisfy with the amount of funding i assume that would mean that there could be an appeal yeah well that be that be the situation i have in mind so the attorney ask for to investigate and the court grant to investigate there could be an appeal about that i mean what about I be sorry i mean one other jurisdictional question be it true that the director of the administrative office of the court can under some circumstance review a funding grant and if that be so how can the funding grant be the exercise of judicial power well i would think the most relevant language be the language of the statute reasonably necessary and i really struggle with that and also with the phrase substantial need but take reasonably necessary if it just say necessary that would be a pretty tough standard would you accept the interpretation of reasonably necessary to mean that this be something that a reasonable attorney would think be necessary but the but the attorney the reasonable attorney still have to think that it be necessary which be pretty tough unless necessary do not mean necessary it be like the necessary and proper clause it do not mean that it be really necessary laughter you really know what they we be think laughter okay what be the difference between reasonably necessary and substantial need i have be rack my brain try to think of something that it be reasonably necessary for me to obtain but as to which i do not have a substantial need and i can not think of an example maybe you can give me an example no do not no do not do that because one be the statutory language and the other be the language that be use by the fifth circuit and that be what we have to deal with no matter what the various court of appeal have say about this yeah okay all right well pick up on what justice breyer just say and try this one last time i think the issue that we have agree to decide be whether the fifth circuit s formulation of substantial need be different from reasonably necessary which be the statutory standard and i still do not understand what the difference be between those two formulation it seem possibly like just a matter of word so explain to me what be the difference between those those two formulation right would a reasonable lawyer think it be necessary right why i mean if you have if it be a reasonable attorney you know reasonably necessary would a reasonable attorney think there be a substantial need for it it it just it seem to me like you be not really argue the question that we grant you be what you be say be that if we take a look at everything that the fifth circuit s be do in this area in lot of case that be not before us it be not do the right thing that seem to be your argument not that there really be a difference between these two verbal formulation a reasonable attorney with finite mean might devote those finite mean to an avenue of investigation that have very very little chance of success because there be so much at stake so i do not understand how that can be the test here where the statutory language be reasonably necessary that seem clearly whatever necessary mean it it mean some degree of importance it have the evidence have to be have to meet some level of importance in order for the standard to be meet i do not see how you can get around it and to say the test be whether what would a reasonable attorney with finite mean do i it seem to me quite meaningless and i think you agree with that standard ,250.84,Roberts Court,"Oct 30, 2017",Carlos Manuel Ayestas,"Lorie Davis, Director, Texas Department of Criminal Justice (Institutional Division)",16-6795,"Apr 3, 2017","Mar 21, 2018",112,1.0,1.0,1.0,1

Well, maybe you could talk about the text. It's not a class? Doesn't 11 -- doesn't 1182(f) say whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens -- -- or any class of aliens. So put class aside, although I don't really see why people who are nationals of a particular country don't constitute a class. What about any aliens? Well, does this proclamation do anything like that? Does this proclamation purport to establish a new permanent immigration policy for the United States? What is your basis for saying that it is perpetual? Can -- can you imagine any situation in which the threat of the infiltration of the United States by terrorists was so severe with respect to a particular country that the other measures that you have mentioned could be deemed by a President to be inadequate? You cannot imagine any such situation? Mr. Katyal, would any reasonable observer reading this proclamation, with -- without taking into account statements, think that this was a Muslim ban? I mean, there are -- I think there are 50 predominantly Muslim countries in the world. Five -- five countries -- five predominantly Muslim countries are on this list. The population of the -- of the predominantly Muslim countries on this list make up about 8 percent of the world's Muslim population. If you looked at the 10 countries with the most Muslims, exactly one -- -- Iran, would be on that list of the top 10. So would a reasonable observer think this was a Muslim ban? No, I -- I understand that. And it is one of our fundamental values that there is religious freedom here for everybody in that, number -- adherence to every religion are entitled to equal treatment. My only point is that if you look at what was done, it does not look at all like a Muslim ban. There are other justifications that jump out as to why these particular countries were put on -- on the list. So you -- it seems to me the list creates a strong inference that this was not done for that invidious purpose.

2017,"Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, Council 31",112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Does -- does the Constitution require states to demand that unions provide services for nonmembers? For example, is there a constitutional requirement for a union to handle the grievances of nonmembers, or is that something that's imposed by state law? Well, no, we're talking about state law. Yeah, I understand that. Are they -- is that constitutionally required? There are -- there are numerous differences between Pickering and the situation here, but let me just ask you about one. Do you think there are any limitations on the authority of the State of Illinois to compel its employees to say what the state wants them to say? And if there are limitations, what are they? No, if it's not a function of their official duties. I understand you could not -- you probably agree with the position you're arguing, but if you didn't, coming here representing the State of Illinois, you couldn't just argue what you like. That's right. (Laughter.) I know. I understand that and in that situation. But aside from your official duties, are there any limitations? What are they? Well, let me ask you, I'll give you a concrete situation. In Connick, an assistant district attorney -- the Court held that an assistant district attorney could be fired for circulating a writing that suggested that there was a lack of confidence in the supervisors in the office. Okay? It was a limitation on what she could say. Do you think the case would have been the same if the district attorney required the assistant district attorney to appear before a meeting of everybody in the office and say: I love my supervisors; they are the best supervisors anybody could possibly want? No, the Court said that that was a matter of -- that was a -- that was a subject of private concern. Private concern. Private concern. Well, then why won't you answer my question about what the assistant district attorney could be required to do? Throughout history, many people have drawn a line between a restriction on their speech and compelled speech. I'll give you an example that's only -- that's quite different given the nature of the -- of the subject from what's involved here. Do you remember the -- the -- the movie and the play ""A Man For All Seasons""? So Thomas Moore didn't insist on saying that he thought the act of supremacy was wrong, but he drew a line and paid for it with his life because he would not affirmatively say that it was wrong. When you compel somebody to speak, don't you infringe that person's dignity and conscience in a way that you do not when you restrict what the person says? No, they're not a -- it's not ""A Man for All Seasons"" scenario. But I'm just asking you about the point whether you think that compelling somebody to speak is exactly the same thing as saying you may not speak? No. And what if the statute -- what if the state statute says that lobbying is a man -- is a mandatory subject of bargaining? Well, there's no -- is there any limit on what states can make a mandatory subject of collective bargaining? So if the test is whether it's -- whether the -- it's mandated by the -- by the state, the state can make anything it wants a mandatory subject of bargaining. Mr. Frederick, I -- when I -- when I read your brief, I saw something I thought I would never see in a brief filed by a public employee union, and that is the argument that the original meaning of the Constitution is that public employees have no free speech rights. Where do you want us to go with that? Should -- should we adopt that rule? Do you think that's a fair characterization of their argument? Well, if one employee says I deserve a 5 percent raise, is that a matter of public concern or private concern? All right. So, if that's a matter of private concern, if the union demands a 5 percent wage increase for all of the employees it represents, can that be a matter of public concern? It can't? No? So what -- what if the effect of the 5 percent wage increase across the board would push a city to the brink and perhaps over the brink into bankruptcy. Would it then become a matter of public concern? Well, the germaneness rule came out of Abood itself and it was fleshed out in Lehnert. So do you -- are you asking -- you're suggesting we should overrule Abood in part? And didn't Abood talk -- Didn't Abood draw -- talk about germaneness?

So it's only the case where -- that you -- you can say there's no genuine dispute on the issue of the officer's motivation.

2017,Patchak v. Zinke,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","If this is a -- just a jurisdiction-stripping statute, could you just say as succinctly as possible what the rule is that you would like us to adopt? What is the -- the separation-of-powers rule that you would like us to adopt with respect to a purely jurisdiction-stripping statute? Well, on that, suppose, following up on the initial questions, if all that 2(b) said was that an action relating to this land shall not be maintained in a federal court, would you say that is not a jurisdiction-stripping statute? Well, if one of the things that 2(b) does is to strip jurisdiction, and if ""shall not"" -- ""shall not be maintained"" is a jurisdiction-stripping provision, then I don't see how you can win unless you have a rule that applies to a jurisdiction-stripping statute. Maybe there are other things in this statute that are vulnerable, so they could be severed. So, to go back to the question I asked, if this is a statute that takes away federal court jurisdiction, what is your separation-of-powers rule? Yeah, but when -- as succinctly as you can, Congress violates the separation of powers when it deprives the federal courts of jurisdiction in this circumstance. And what is the circumstance? But I -- I thought the Chief Justice's examples were instances in which a hypothetical statute deprived the federal court of the opportunity to rule on violations of -- on constitutional -- alleged constitutional violations, the same as the question that Justice Ginsburg gave to you, taking away jurisdiction over cases involving prayer in the schools or jurisdiction over equal protection violations, but this is a statutory case. I mean, it sounds like this is just based on your -- your analysis of Congress's intent. Let's take a case that we -- we had earlier this term under the Alien Tort Statute. I don't know whether you're familiar with it. But it provides jurisdiction in the federal courts for a suit by an alien concerning certain torts. And we have the question whether a -- a corporation can be sued. Suppose Congress were to pass a statute that says that no federal court shall have jurisdiction of an Alien Tort Statute suit where the defendant is a corporation. There are a limited number of cases involving that, pending cases. Would that be unconstitutional? Well, the literal -- Can you point to any case in which we've held there was sovereign immunity where the statute said nothing -- never mentioned either immunity or the United States as a party? Well, how much broader is it? It's somewhat difficult to decide this case without having some idea what ""relating to"" here means. It's hard to believe that this statute means what it literally says -- -- that no -- no action relating to the land -- suppose that -- that the tribe said anybody who has toxic waste any place in the country can bring it here and just dump it in a big pit. Would you say, well, the federal government couldn't bring a lawsuit about that? Okay. So what does ""relating to"" mean? ",if this be a just a jurisdiction strip statute could you just say as succinctly as possible what the rule be that you would like us to adopt what be the the separation of power rule that you would like us to adopt with respect to a purely jurisdiction strip statute well on that suppose follow up on the initial question if all that b say be that an action relate to this land shall not be maintain in a federal court would you say that be not a jurisdiction strip statute well if one of the thing that b do be to strip jurisdiction and if shall not shall not be maintain be a jurisdiction strip provision then i do not see how you can win unless you have a rule that apply to a jurisdiction strip statute maybe there be other thing in this statute that be vulnerable so they could be sever so to go back to the question i ask if this be a statute that take away federal court jurisdiction what be your separation of power rule yeah but when as succinctly as you can congress violate the separation of power when it deprive the federal court of jurisdiction in this circumstance and what be the circumstance but i i think the chief justice s example we be instance in which a hypothetical statute deprive the federal court of the opportunity to rule on violation of on constitutional allege constitutional violation the same as the question that justice ginsburg give to you take away jurisdiction over case involve prayer in the school or jurisdiction over equal protection violation but this be a statutory case i mean it sound like this be just base on your your analysis of congress s intent let us take a case that we we have earlier this term under the alien tort statute i do not know whether you be familiar with it but it provide jurisdiction in the federal court for a suit by an alien concern certain tort and we have the question whether a a corporation can be sue suppose congress we be to pass a statute that say that no federal court shall have jurisdiction of an alien tort statute suit where the defendant be a corporation there be a limited number of case involve that pending case would that be unconstitutional well the literal can you point to any case in which we have hold there be sovereign immunity where the statute say nothing never mention either immunity or the united state as a party well how much broad be it it be somewhat difficult to decide this case without have some idea what relate to here mean it be hard to believe that this statute mean what it literally say that no no action relate to the land suppose that that the tribe say anybody who have toxic waste any place in the country can bring it here and just dump it in a big pit would you say well the federal government could not bring a lawsuit about that okay so what do relate to mean ,188.56,Roberts Court,"Nov 7, 2017",David Patchak,"Ryan Zinke, Sec. of Interior",16-498,"May 1, 2017","Feb 27, 2018",112,0.0,1.0,0.0,0

2017,"U.S. Bank National Association v. Village at Lakeridge, LLC",112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","But what if the definition -- Well, I think you're talking about two separate questions. And it's not your fault that the two are hard to separate because we took one question and we didn't take the other. But the issue here is what is the standard of appellate review with respect to the standard that was applied by the Ninth Circuit. I take it that is the -- the question. And the Ninth Circuit standard has two components. One is whether it was an arm's length transaction. And if the definition of an arm's length transaction is the one that Justice Ginsburg mentioned, which I think comes right out of Black's Law Dictionary, is it the kind of transaction in which strangers would engage? Isn't that a -- a question of fact? Isn't that very close to a question of pure fact? Which entity -- which entity is better positioned based on role and experience to determine whether a particular transaction is the kind of transaction in which strangers would engage, the bankruptcy judge or a panel of the court of appeals? No, I think you have a strong argument on that. But on the -- on the second part, whether it's an arm's length transaction, why is it preferable for a court of appeals panel to decide whether this is the kind of transaction that strangers would engage in? Can I ask you a question of -- drawing on your experience as a practitioner? In this case, and I suppose in other cases where this comes up, what is at issue is whether a plan of reorganization is going to be confirmed or whether the debtor is going to be liquidated. And from the perspective of bankruptcy judges in your experience, what is the dynamic regarding that determination? Do they have a tendency to try to achieve one result or the other? Well, if Bartlett and Rabkin were married, then he would be a statutory insider, would he not? All right. So -- because he would be a relative, and a relative is defined as somebody within the third degree of consanguinity. And I doubt that I remember this from the bar review, but I looked it up, and the third degree of consanguinity includes grandparents-in-law, brother and sister-in-law, grandchild-in-law. Now, how does that square with the test that the Ninth Circuit seems to -- I'm sorry, that the bankruptcy court seems to have applied here? Did they live together? Did they share finances? I mean, they weren't as close -- they were not at least as close as a brother or sister-in-law? I -- I mean, if that's the kind of determination you think we should -- that should be deferred to under the clear error standard, that's not a very good example, is it? Why -- why is that true? Because I have certainly heard it said, as your opponent said in answer to my question, that bankruptcy judges have a very strong tendency to want to get plans confirmed and to do what is necessary to get plans confirmed. And maybe in the heat of that, trying to make sure that the plan can be confirmed, and it doesn't have to preside over a liquidation, there is a tendency to stretch things, as certainly -- I mean, Judge Clifton's opinion in this case is pretty strong that this was -- this was -- at least that this was clear error. What do you say to that? I don't doubt that they act in good faith, but you're saying that they're better -- better situated as an institutional matter. Why is that so? Once all the facts are established, why is it preferable for a bankruptcy judge as opposed to a court of appeals panel to decide whether those facts make the person in question comparable to a statutory insider? But appeals are not always a bad thing. Whether somebody is a -- is an insider seems to be a question of status, whether it's a statutory insider or a non-statutory insider. So, how do you get from a question of status to a question that examines the particulars of a particular -- of a transaction and the motivation and the relationship between the parties? Well, suppose that Dr. Rabkin and Ms. Bartlett had a relationship that was exactly like that of a married couple except that they hadn't gotten married. They lived together for a long time, they shared finances, they had children together. Would the transaction -- would -- would -- could Dr. Rabkin then not be an insider on the ground that the particular transaction was done at arm's length? Does that seem right?

Does it apply only to the -- the latter office that actually prosecutes the case? Suppose the federal -- the -- the -- the federal investigators request the company to bring officers or employees who are located in other parts of the country to a particular office to be questioned, or suppose they ask them to go through the company's records to find certain documents, and the company does that and incurs expenses. Are -- is that covered? I -- I don't quite understand that answer, that if someone at the request of the FBI goes through company records and incurs perhaps quite an expense in doing that, that is not participation in the government's investigation? What are -- what are proceedings related to the offense, other than proceedings in the prosecution of the offense? Well, those -- those would be proceedings in the prosecution. Well, they used the term ""prosecution"" earlier in the provision. If they wanted to limit it to proceedings in the prosecution, why wouldn't they use the same term again? Why would they use this broader formulation, ""related to the offense""? Okay. So you -- maybe you've got the grand jury proceeding, but you have nothing else, right? That's it? If the -- if Congress intended to cover an investigation conducted by a company, wouldn't it -- wouldn't it use a term like ""reasonable,"" reasonable expenses incurred? Well, there's a big difference between necessary -- well, how would you determine whether the scope of an internal investigation is necessary? What does that mean?

2017,National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","But what if it wasn't targeted? What if there were a state law that required every doctor or facility that provides medical treatment for pregnant women to post a notice setting out the full range of options available to those women and where they might obtain services at no cost, if those -- if -- if those are available? Would there be anything wrong with a law like that? What if it did that to -- what if this notice provided for -- set out all of the options and it applied to everybody, so it would apply to pro-life facilities, but it would also apply to clinics that perform abortions? And provide no other form of assistance for pregnant women? Mr. Wall, before your -- -- before your time expires, can I -- can I ask you something about your brief that -- that troubles me and, that is, the government's request that we recognize a new category of speech called professional speech, which is subject to a -- a lesser standard of review. I mean, this case is very important in itself, but adopting this new category of speech would have far-reaching consequences. And I -- I -- I'd like you to explain why that is consistent with Stevens and other cases where the Court has recently said we are not going to recognize any new categories of unprotected speech and how you would define the boundaries of professional speech. And there have been a lot of cases on -- there have been some cases on this in the lower courts. But just to take a couple of examples: Journalists are professionals. So would they be subject to this standard? How about economists? How about climate scientists? How about a fortune teller? The Fourth Circuit said that a fortune teller is a -- is a professional. How about somebody who writes an advice column for parents? I mean, wouldn't we be getting into very dangerous territory if we do this? If you have a law that's neutral on its face, but then it has a lot of crazy exemptions, and when you apply all the exemptions, what you're left with is a very strange pattern and, gee, it turns out that just about the only clinics that are covered by this are pro-life clinics. Do you think it's possible to infer intentional discrimination in that situation? Okay. So let me ask you about some of these exemptions which I think are hard to understand. Why does this apply only to clinics whose primary function is providing service to pregnant women? You could have a small clinic, let's say it's -- it has 30 pregnant women come in a month, but that's the primary thing it does. Then you could have a big clinic that has 100 pregnant women come in a month, but it does so many other things that pregnancy is not the primary concern. Why -- why would -- why does the law apply to one and not the other? Well, I mean, I don't understand that. Why -- how -- why does it apply almost only to for -- to non-profits and not for-profits? If the purpose is to get this information out to poor women, don't you think there are examples of poor women who stumble into a for-profit facility? Wouldn't it be beneficial for them to know that they could get treatment at no cost through the state? Why are most for-profits exempted? What about individual doctors? Why are they exempt? So, when you put all this together, you get a very suspicious pattern. And I don't know that we need to go into statistics about what the percentage of covered clinics are -- are pro-life and -- and -- and what are not, but we do -- we have an amicus brief from a party in the state court case where the state court held that this law is unconstitutional. And according to their statistics, 98.5 percent of the covered clinics are pro-life clinics. Do you dispute that? So what is your position on that? What's the percentage? No, that's not -- that's not -- show me where that is in the statute. If it's a covered facility, then any ad that they put out, including one that just says ""Choose Life,"" has to -- has to include this disclaimer: We're not licensed. Yes, it has to do those things. So you have a facility that offers pregnancy testing and they advertise that they offer pregnancy testing. That's all they do. And they put up a sign, an ad that says ""choose life."" They have to put in the disclaimer? Well, what is the situation for Los Angeles County? This is California law. You should know the answer. Somebody is going to put up an ad. A covered unlicensed facility posts an ad in Los Angeles County. In how many languages must they print the disclosure -- the disclaimer? What kind of ad -- -- if it's -- what kind of an ad would -- as to what type of ad would that not be unconstitutional? ",but what if it be not target what if there we be a state law that require every doctor or facility that provide medical treatment for pregnant woman to post a notice set out the full range of option available to those woman and where they might obtain service at no cost if those if if those be available would there be anything wrong with a law like that what if it do that to what if this notice provide for set out all of the option and it apply to everybody so it would apply to pro life facility but it would also apply to clinic that perform abortion and provide no other form of assistance for pregnant woman mr wall before your before your time expire can i can i ask you something about your brief that that trouble me and that be the government s request that we recognize a new category of speech call professional speech which be subject to a a less standard of review i mean this case be very important in itself but adopt this new category of speech would have far reach consequence and i i I would like you to explain why that be consistent with stevens and other case where the court have recently say we be not go to recognize any new category of unprotected speech and how you would define the boundary of professional speech and there have be a lot of case on there have be some case on this in the low court but just to take a couple of example journalist be professional so would they be subject to this standard how about economist how about climate scientist how about a fortune teller the fourth circuit say that a fortune teller be a be a professional how about somebody who write an advice column for parent i mean would not we be get into very dangerous territory if we do this if you have a law that be neutral on its face but then it have a lot of crazy exemption and when you apply all the exemption what you be leave with be a very strange pattern and gee it turn out that just about the only clinic that be cover by this be pro life clinic do you think it be possible to infer intentional discrimination in that situation okay so let me ask you about some of these exemption which i think be hard to understand why do this apply only to clinic whose primary function be provide service to pregnant woman you could have a small clinic let us say it be it have pregnant woman come in a month but that be the primary thing it do then you could have a big clinic that have pregnant woman come in a month but it do so many other thing that pregnancy be not the primary concern why why would why do the law apply to one and not the other well i mean i do not understand that why how why do it apply almost only to for to non profit and not for profit if the purpose be to get this information out to poor woman do not you think there be example of poor woman who stumble into a for profit facility would not it be beneficial for them to know that they could get treatment at no cost through the state why be most for profit exempt what about individual doctor why be they exempt so when you put all this together you get a very suspicious pattern and i do not know that we need to go into statistic about what the percentage of covered clinic be be pro life and and and what be not but we do we have an amicus brief from a party in the state court case where the state court hold that this law be unconstitutional and accord to their statistic percent of the covered clinic be pro life clinic do you dispute that so what be your position on that what be the percentage no that be not that be not show me where that be in the statute if it be a covered facility then any ad that they put out include one that just say choose life have to have to include this disclaimer we be not license yes it have to do those thing so you have a facility that offer pregnancy test and they advertise that they offer pregnancy testing that be all they do and they put up a sign an ad that say choose life they have to put in the disclaimer well what be the situation for los angeles county this be california law you should know the answer somebody be go to put up an ad a covered unlicensed facility post an ad in los angeles county in how many language must they print the disclosure the disclaimer what kind of ad if it be what kind of an ad would as to what type of ad would that not be unconstitutional ,306.08,Roberts Court,"Mar 20, 2018","National Institute of Family and Life Advocates, et al.","Xavier Becerra, et al.",16-1140,"Nov 13, 2017","Jun 26, 2018",112,1.0,1.0,0.0,1
2017,Hamer v. Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","And why is that? Do you think there is anything that would bar the rules of appellate procedure from altering doctrines like forfeiture, waiver, and exceptional circumstances? Well, this is -- assuming it's not jurisdictional, it is a mandatory claims processing rule. And it -- it comes -- it follows from a version of the statute that did impose a hard time limit, did it not? The prior version of the statute had a time limit. And there's at least some question whether Congress really intended to eliminate that or whether it was done inadvertently or whether it was done on the assumption that a time limit in the rules would also be jurisdictional, as this Court had suggested in some earlier cases. Is all of that -- is any of that untrue? Well, given that this is a mandatory claims processing rule, and you said that you didn't think there was anything that would prevent the rules from altering doctrines like forfeiture and waiver, would it be within the discretion of a Court of Appeals to say that we are going to treat this rule, even though it's not jurisdictional, in some respects as if it were jurisdictional, so that, for example, we will sua sponte raise the question of timeliness under the rule? Well, how is that consistent with your answer that you -- that that doctrine could be changed via a rule? Well, if the doctrine could be changed by rule, could a court of appeals interpret the rule as changing the doctrine? After all, it is a mandatory claims-processing rule. There has to be some teeth in the concept of mandatory. Well, for whose -- for whose benefit do you think something like the 30-day rule was adopted? Solely for the benefit of the -- of the appellee? Ah, well, if it's at least partly for the benefit of the court, then why is the court stuck with whatever the appellee does on the issue of forfeiture? If the appellee is asleep and this rule was supposed at least in part to protect the jurisdiction of the court of appeals, why can't the court of appeals put some teeth in this? Not by treating it as strictly jurisdictional, but as having -- putting a thumb certainly on the scale in -- in applying the doctrines that you're relying on. At what point in time do you think the issue was -- was waived? So not before that? Nothing that occurred in the district court waived the -- When was it -- when was it forfeited? So it wasn't forfeited on the day when the district court entered the order. It was -- because you -- the order didn't preclude the filing of the notice of appeal prior to the expiration of the time in the order. So you -- so you think that the appellee had on pain of forfeiture, they had an obligation to inform the other side and the court just prior to the running out of the time, you know, you're going to run -- you're going to have a problem here under the rule if you don't file your notice of appeal right away? They had that obligation to do that? How is that consistent with the adversary system? I mean, this isn't the other side -- the -- did she have an attorney at that point? Order from which the appeal -- the order from which the appeal had to be taken was summary judgment for the defendant. That's the judgment, right? And the appellee wants an affirmance of that judgment? And that could be affirmed on the grounds that summary judgment was proper. It could also be affirmed on the ground that the -- the notice of appeal was untimely. Every time the party that wins in the district court wins on the merits in the district court, also thinks that it has a jurisdictional argument, they have to file a cross-appeal. All right. A -- a -- a mandatory claims processing argument, they have to file a cross-appeal?

2017,Gill v. Whitford,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Before you get too deeply into the merits, which I -- I assume you'll want to do in a minute, can I just ask you a question about standing along the lines of those asked by my colleagues? Suppose that it was alleged that town officials in someplace in northern Wisconsin where the Republicans predominate were discriminating against the Democratic candidate for a legislative district by, let's say, not allowing that candidate's signs to be put up along the roadsides, but allowing the Republican signs to be put up along the roadsides, or they were pressuring town -- let's just leave it at that. They're discriminating with respect to these signs. Now, who would have standing to raise a First Amendment challenge to that? Would it be just the candidate in that district or maybe voters in that district? Or could a -- a Democratic voter in, let's say, Milwaukee have standing to raise that First Amendment argument? Can I take you back to -- to Justice Kagan's question about the legislators' use of these techniques? Are all the techniques that are used by politicians in order to try to maximize their chances of electoral success scientific? I think they rely a lot on polls, don't they? How scientific have they proven to be? It's not a -- that's not a manageable standard. It's not a manageable standard that you cannot have a law that says draw maps to favor one party or the other. That seems like a perfectly manageable standard. You cannot have that. I don't understand -- Why -- why is it de minimis? It seems to me it's exactly the same thing. If you have a system, let's extend it to many towns that are controlled by the Republicans and they're taking down all the Democratic signs. And if that's an effective strategy, it will mean fewer members of the legislature are Democrats and, therefore, the interests of the Democratic voter in Milwaukee or Madison will be impaired. It seems like exactly the same thing. All right. Well, on the -- let's -- let's look at the race issue. So you have a state where there you have an African American voter in -- in a -- in one part of the state who wants to complain that districts in another part of the state are -- are packed or cracked and, as a result of that, there are going to be fewer African Americans in the legislature than there should be. And that's going to impair that person's interests, including, I would suppose, their right of association. What -- what is the difference between those two situations? Well, Mr. Smith -- Mr. Smith, can I just say something -- ask you a question about the political science? I mean, I -- gerrymandering is distasteful. But if we are going to impose a standard on the courts, it has to be something that's manageable and it has to be something that's sufficiently concrete so that the public reaction to decisions is not going to be the one that the Chief Justice mentioned, that this three-judge court decided this, that -- this way because two of the three were appointed by a Republican president or two of the three were appointed by a Democratic president. Now, it's been 30 years since Bandemer, and before then and since then, judges, scholars, legal scholars, political scientists have been looking for a manageable standard. All right. In 2014, a young researcher publishes a paper, Eric McGhee publishes a paper, in which he says that the measures that were previously -- the leading measures previously, symmetry and responsiveness, are inadequate. But I have discovered the key. I have discovered the Rosetta stone and it's -- it is the efficiency gap. And then a year later you bring this suit and you say: There it is, that is the constitutional standard. It's been finally -- after 200 years, it's been finally discovered in this paper by a young researcher, who concludes in the end -- this is the end of his paper -- after saying symmetry and responsiveness have shown to be -- looked to be inappropriate, ""The measure I have offered here, relative wasted votes, is arguably"" -- arguably -- ""a more valid and flexible measure of -- of partisan -- of partisan gerrymandering."" Now, is this -- is this the time for us to jump into this? Has there been a great body of scholarship that has tested this efficiency gap? It's full of questions. Mr. McGhee's own amicus brief outlines numerous unanswered questions with -- with this theory. What do you do in -- in elections that are not contested? Well, then you have to -- you have to make two guesses. How many people would have voted for the winning candidate if it had been a contested election? How many people would have voted for the losing candidate if it had been a contested election? One of the judges in the court below asks: Why do you calculate EG by map, by subtracting from the votes obtained by the winner, 50 percent of the votes, instead of the votes obtained by the runner up? And Mr. McGhee says: Well, I have an answer to this, and I have a forthcoming paper and I'll answer it in the forthcoming paper. (Laughter.) And there are all of these questions. This is -- 2017 is the time to jump into this? That's a question. Yeah, there is a question there. There are about 10 of them. (Laughter.) Excuse me. Isn't it true that -- Just on that, isn't it true that you could -- you can get very high levels of -- very high EG based on factors that have nothing to do with gerrymandering? The -- the political geography can lead to it; protection of incumbents, which has been said to be a legitimate factor, can lead to a high EG; compliance with the Voting Rights Act can affect that? How are they taken care of at the justification stage? The proposal is to run many -- you know, millions of -- of alternative maps to see whether using some traditional districting requirements, you can produce a map that has a lower -- a lower EG. But my understanding is that when that's done, those maps do not take into account either incumbent protection or compliance with the Voting Rights Act, both of which can have a very big effect. It's just one of the dozens of uncertainties about this whole process. You -- you paint a very dire picture about gerrymandering and its effects, but I was struck by something in the seminal article by your expert, Mr. McGhee, and he says there, ""I show that the effects of party control on bias are small and decay rapidly, suggesting that redistricting is at best a blunt tool for promoting partisan interests."" So he was wrong in that. He's right with the EG. That's the Rosetta Stone, but he's wrong in that. Well, that's what he said. ",before you get too deeply into the merit which i i assume you will want to do in a minute can i just ask you a question about stand along the line of those ask by my colleague suppose that it be allege that town official in someplace in northern wisconsin where the republican predominate we be discriminate against the democratic candidate for a legislative district by let us say not allow that candidate s sign to be put up along the roadside but allow the republican sign to be put up along the roadside or they we be pressure town let us just leave it at that they be discriminate with respect to these sign now who would have stand to raise a first amendment challenge to that would it be just the candidate in that district or maybe voter in that district or could a a democratic voter in let us say milwaukee have stand to raise that first amendment argument can i take you back to to justice kagan s question about the legislator use of these technique be all the technique that be use by politician in order to try to maximize their chance of electoral success scientific i think they rely a lot on poll do not they how scientific have they prove to be it be not a that be not a manageable standard it be not a manageable standard that you can not have a law that say draw map to favor one party or the other that seem like a perfectly manageable standard you can not have that i do not understand why why be it de minimis it seem to me it be exactly the same thing if you have a system let us extend it to many town that be control by the republican and they be take down all the democratic sign and if that be an effective strategy it will mean few member of the legislature be democrat and therefore the interest of the democratic voter in milwaukee or madison will be impair it seem like exactly the same thing all right well on the let us let us look at the race issue so you have a state where there you have an african american voter in in a in one part of the state who want to complain that district in another part of the state be be packed or crack and as a result of that there be go to be few african american in the legislature than there should be and that be go to impair that person s interest include i would suppose their right of association what what be the difference between those two situation well mr smith mr smith can i just say something ask you a question about the political science i mean i gerrymandering be distasteful but if we be go to impose a standard on the court it have to be something that be manageable and it have to be something that be sufficiently concrete so that the public reaction to decision be not go to be the one that the chief justice mention that this three judge court decide this that this way because two of the three we be appoint by a republican president or two of the three we be appoint by a democratic president now it be be year since bandemer and before then and since then judge scholar legal scholar political scientist have be look for a manageable standard all right in a young researcher publish a paper eric mcghee publish a paper in which he say that the measure that we be previously the leading measure previously symmetry and responsiveness be inadequate but i have discover the key i have discover the rosetta stone and it be it be the efficiency gap and then a year later you bring this suit and you say there it be that be the constitutional standard it be be finally after year it have be finally discover in this paper by a young researcher who conclude in the end this be the end of his paper after say symmetry and responsiveness have show to be look to be inappropriate the measure i have offer here relative waste vote be arguably arguably a more valid and flexible measure of of partisan of partisan gerrymandering now be this be this the time for us to jump into this have there be a great body of scholarship that have test this efficiency gap it be full of question mr mcghee s own amicus brief outline numerous unanswered question with with this theory what do you do in in election that be not contest well then you have to you have to make two guess how many people would have vote for the winning candidate if it have be a contested election how many people would have vote for the losing candidate if it have be a contested election one of the judge in the court below asks why do you calculate eg by map by subtract from the vote obtain by the winner percent of the vote instead of the vote obtain by the runner up and mr mcghee say well i have an answer to this and i have a forthcoming paper and I will answer it in the forthcoming paper laughter and there be all of these question this be be the time to jump into this that be a question yeah there be a question there there be about of them laughter excuse me be not it true that just on that be not it true that you could you can get very high level of very high eg base on factor that have nothing to do with gerrymandering the the political geography can lead to it protection of incumbent which have be say to be a legitimate factor can lead to a high eg compliance with the voting right act can affect that how be they take care of at the justification stage the proposal be to run many you know million of of alternative map to see whether use some traditional districting requirement you can produce a map that have a low a low eg but my understanding be that when that be do those map do not take into account either incumbent protection or compliance with the voting right act both of which

2017,Hughes v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, suppose we -- no, you go ahead. Well, Marks has been the -- the law for 40 years, and for better or worse, it has had a big effect, I think, on what we have understood to be the jurisprudence of this Court and what the lower courts have understood to be our precedents and on the way in which justices of this Court go about doing their job. And if we abandon anything like Marks, perhaps it requires -- it certainly could benefit from some clarification and maybe some refinement -- but if we abandon it completely, it could have pretty profound changes. Why should we do that? Well, you know, Professor -- Professor Re wrote an interesting amicus brief in this case arguing that the logical subset approach is illogical. And I think there might be something to that. Let me give you this example. Let's say that nine people are deciding which movie to go and see, and four of them want to see a romantic comedy, and two of them want to see a romantic comedy in French, and four of them want to see a mystery. Now is the -- are the -- are the two who want to see the romantic comedy in French, is that a logical subset of those who want to see a romantic comedy? Well, suppose we know nothing more than that. I mean, if that's a logical subset, I think there's a serious problem with the argument because the four who want to see a romantic comedy might think: I don't want to see anything in a foreign language, particularly in French. I'd rather go see a mystery or something else. Well, can I just ask you this quick question? Suppose that there's a majority of the Court that -- that agrees that a particular party is entitled to relief, but there is no majority as to the provision of the Constitution that provides the relief. What happens in that situation? So that's never a precedent unless one of the two -- and both of these groups feel very strongly that the other is wrong in identifying the constitutional provision. So one of them has to give way or else this issue is never going to be resolved? So the lower courts would then be free to deny relief in -- in all these cases? If we followed the -- your predictive approach, why should we -- could it not be confined to the opinions that concurred in the judgment? Why should we count the dissents? Why -- why not just look at the -- the -- the ones that concurred in the judgment? ",well suppose we no you go ahead well mark have be the the law for year and for good or bad it have have a big effect i think on what we have understand to be the jurisprudence of this court and what the low court have understand to be our precedent and on the way in which justice of this court go about do their job and if we abandon anything like mark perhaps it require it certainly could benefit from some clarification and maybe some refinement but if we abandon it completely it could have pretty profound change why should we do that well you know professor professor re write an interesting amicus brief in this case argue that the logical subset approach be illogical and i think there might be something to that let me give you this example let us say that nine people be decide which movie to go and see and four of them want to see a romantic comedy and two of them want to see a romantic comedy in french and four of them want to see a mystery now be the be the be the two who want to see the romantic comedy in french be that a logical subset of those who want to see a romantic comedy well suppose we know nothing more than that i mean if that be a logical subset i think there be a serious problem with the argument because the four who want to see a romantic comedy might think i do not want to see anything in a foreign language particularly in french I would rather go see a mystery or something else well can i just ask you this quick question suppose that there be a majority of the court that that agree that a particular party be entitle to relief but there be no majority as to the provision of the constitution that provide the relief what happen in that situation so that be never a precedent unless one of the two and both of these group feel very strongly that the other be wrong in identify the constitutional provision so one of them have to give way or else this issue be never go to be resolve so the low court would then be free to deny relief in in all these case if we follow the your predictive approach why should we could it not be confine to the opinion that concur in the judgment why should we count the dissent why why not just look at the the the one that concur in the judgment ,156.31,Roberts Court,"Mar 27, 2018",Erik Lindsey Hughes,United States of America,17-155,"Dec 8, 2017","Jun 4, 2018",112,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2017,"Animal Science Products, Inc. v. Hebei Welcome Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.",112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Suppose there's a case where there's an issue of foreign law, there's also an issue of -- of U.S. law in a U.S. court, and the court receives a submission from the ministry of commerce from the foreign country and also a brief submitted by the United States on behalf of the U.S. Department of Commerce. Are they treated the same way? Well, it's a brief submitted -- it's a brief submitted by the Department of Justice on behalf of the Department of Commerce. It's the official statement of the executive branch of the U.S. government. And you have something comparable from a foreign government. So are they treated the same way? Why not? Well, let me reformulate my question. Suppose the foreign country is just like the United -- it's exactly like the United States, except it's not the United States. It's a foreign country. So the government is exactly the same, exactly the same structure, everything relates to each other in exactly the same way. And you get a brief from the -- the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Department of Commerce from this alter ego-United States. Would they be treated the same way? Yes. Yeah. Is there anything about the fact that one is different -- is a foreign country and one is the United States that would point to different treatment? You don't see a difference -- Mr. Phillips -- -- here are two -- here are two possibilities: One is the Court says we will give respectful consideration to the submission, but in the end, we will decide what the law is. The other is we will consider -- we will determine whether the submission is reasonable, and if it is reasonable, we will regard it as conclusive. Are they the same? Isn't the second what the Second Circuit said? What if the entity that submits the brief on behalf of the foreign country does not have the authority under the law of that country to dictate what the law is? What if the entity is like the executive branch of the government of the United States, which does not have the authority to dictate what the law is? It -- it can express an opinion, and that's generally -- it's very often correct and it's entitled to respectful consideration. Well, why is it not this case? I -- I thought you just told me that if the entity that submitted the brief on behalf of the foreign country does not have the authority to dictate foreign law, then all it should get is respectful consideration but that this case is different. But then you seem to have turned around and said no, the rule across the board is that you follow what the foreign government submits. So which is it? Could this issue ever come up in China -- in the Chinese courts? I don't understand enough about the Chinese legal system, but could this come before the Supreme People's Court? And would they just say, okay, this is what the Ministry of Commerce says; that's the end of the matter? And can you point to something that shows that?

2017,Collins v. Virginia,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","But what if it didn't? So they have a warrant here, let's say, to search for -- they have probable cause to search this thing covered by a -- a tarp. They have a warrant to search this motorcycle because it's been involved in criminal activity. They want to get the vehicle identification number from it. And they see it. Let's say it's parked two feet from the curb. But arguably -- or it's parked where it is here, maybe in the curtilage, maybe not in the curtilage. The -- that warrant would be insufficient? And this is my question about your argument based on the curtilage. We -- we ask whether a search within or outside the curtilage in order to determine whether the Fourth Amendment applies at all. But that's not really the question here because there is probable cause, and there is the motor vehicle exception to the warrant requirement. So the issue is not whether there was a search. Yes, there was a search. And, yes, you know, if it -- if it was the curtilage, then there was -- there -- there was an intrusion on the protected area. But the warrant -- the motor vehicle exception to the warrant requirement, I take it, is based on two things. One is the -- the risk that the vehicle is going to be moved during the time when the warrant is sought and, second, is a consideration on the other side of the risk that if there's not a warrant, the police will be wrong about probable cause and the degree of intrusion on property, on legitimate property interests that occur in that situation. It's a balancing. It's not a consideration of whether it's on the curtilage or not. And it's hard to see why the balance is any different here than it would be if this motorcycle had been parked on the street. The -- the risk that it will be moved seems to be almost exactly the same. And what -- what is the additional invasion of privacy? The invasion of privacy that's involved in walking a few feet up a driveway, and the home is not even Mr. Byrd's home. Why does the balance come out different here? Yeah -- no, I think the privacy interests would be quite different if this was in the house or if it was in the garage, but this is not in either of those places. It's in a spot that's visible from the street, right? So if this motorcycle were parked on the street and it was covered by a tarp, you would say that the motor vehicle exception doesn't apply because it's covered by a tarp? So what's the relevance of the tarp? But the -- Did -- coming back to Justice -- to the -- to the question, did we say in Jardines that the curtilage is to be treated the same as the house for all Fourth Amendment purposes? I thought the issue in Jardines was whether -- was whether officers who did not have probable cause were permitted to walk up to the front of the house, at which point they acquired probable cause. Do you dispute the fact that they had probable cause to believe that the thing that they saw covered by the tarp was the motorcycle they were looking for? Okay. No, it's not like Jardines -- He had probable cause -- you -- I thought you admitted he had probable cause to believe that the thing covered by the tarp was the motorcycle that he -- had eluded him by driving 140 miles an hour. Right? So he has probable cause to search that motorcycle, to find the -- the vehicle identification number, which will tell him the owner of the motorcycle, which will help him arrest the person who committed this crime, right? So the case comes down to this: If the motorcycle were parked on the street or maybe further down the driveway, and, therefore, not in the curtilage, they wouldn't need a warrant. They could search it. But because it was parked a few feet further away, although in a spot that's visible from the street, they could search it in the first instance because of the risk that the motorcycle will be taken away, but in the second instance, moved a few feet further up the driveway, still visible from the street, can't be -- they can't search it because of the additional invasion of privacy that is involved in walking those few feet up the driveway? That's what the case comes down to? I mean, they're -- -- garages. But, Mr. Cox, you know the -- the Fourth Amendment says the people have the right to be secure in their homes, papers, persons, and effects. So in the curtilage -- the curtilage issue goes to the question of whether it is a search of the home. If it's not in the curtilage -- curtilage, then it's not a search of the home, the Fourth Amendment doesn't apply. But once you get beyond that, it is a search of the home, the ultimate Fourth Amendment question is always: Is it a reasonable search? And that's where we are here. Is it reasonable? It's a balancing of interests. That's what reasonableness meant in -- at the end of the 18th century; it's what it means today. And so you have to grapple with the real privacy interests that are involved in the case versus the other considerations; namely, the mobility of the automobile. And that, I understand your argument to be, is why it's reasonable to draw a distinction between an enclosed place like the house or garage and an open place like a driveway, even if it technically falls within the curtilage. ",but what if it do not so they have a warrant here let us say to search for they have probable because to search this thing cover by a a tarp they have a warrant to search this motorcycle because it be be involve in criminal activity they want to get the vehicle identification number from it and they see it let us say it be park two foot from the curb but arguably or it be park where it be here maybe in the curtilage maybe not in the curtilage the that warrant would be insufficient and this be my question about your argument base on the curtilage we we ask whether a search within or outside the curtilage in order to determine whether the fourth amendment applies at all but that be not really the question here because there be probable because and there be the motor vehicle exception to the warrant requirement so the issue be not whether there be a search yes there be a search and yes you know if it if it be the curtilage then there be there there be an intrusion on the protected area but the warrant the motor vehicle exception to the warrant requirement i take it be base on two thing one be the the risk that the vehicle be go to be move during the time when the warrant be seek and second be a consideration on the other side of the risk that if there be not a warrant the police will be wrong about probable because and the degree of intrusion on property on legitimate property interest that occur in that situation it be a balancing it be not a consideration of whether it be on the curtilage or not and it be hard to see why the balance be any different here than it would be if this motorcycle have be park on the street the the risk that it will be move seem to be almost exactly the same and what what be the additional invasion of privacy the invasion of privacy that be involve in walk a few foot up a driveway and the home be not even mr byrd s home why do the balance come out different here yeah no i think the privacy interest would be quite different if this be in the house or if it be in the garage but this be not in either of those place it be in a spot that be visible from the street right so if this motorcycle we be park on the street and it be cover by a tarp you would say that the motor vehicle exception do not apply because it be cover by a tarp so what be the relevance of the tarp but the do come back to justice to the to the question do we say in jardines that the curtilage be to be treat the same as the house for all fourth amendment purpose i think the issue in jardines be whether be whether officer who do not have probable because we be permit to walk up to the front of the house at which point they acquire probable because do you dispute the fact that they have probable because to believe that the thing that they saw cover by the tarp be the motorcycle they we be look for okay no it be not like jardines he have probable because you i think you admit he have probable because to believe that the thing cover by the tarp be the motorcycle that he have elude him by drive mile an hour right so he have probable because to search that motorcycle to find the the vehicle identification number which will tell him the owner of the motorcycle which will help him arrest the person who commit this crime right so the case come down to this if the motorcycle we be park on the street or maybe far down the driveway and therefore not in the curtilage they would not need a warrant they could search it but because it be park a few foot far away although in a spot that be visible from the street they could search it in the first instance because of the risk that the motorcycle will be take away but in the second instance move a few foot far up the driveway still visible from the street can not be they can not search it because of the additional invasion of privacy that be involve in walk those few foot up the driveway that be what the case come down to i mean they be garage but mr cox you know the the fourth amendment say the people have the right to be secure in their home paper person and effect so in the curtilage the curtilage issue go to the question of whether it be a search of the home if it be not in the curtilage curtilage then it be not a search of the home the fourth amendment do not apply but once you get beyond that it be a search of the home the ultimate fourth amendment question be always be it a reasonable search and that be where we be here be it reasonable it be a balancing of interest that be what reasonableness meant in at the end of the th century it be what it mean today and so you have to grapple with the real privacy interest that be involve in the case versus the other consideration namely the mobility of the automobile and that i understand your argument to be be why it be reasonable to draw a distinction between an enclosed place like the house or garage and an open place like a driveway even if it technically fall within the curtilage ,338.92,Roberts

2017,China Agritech v. Resh,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Are you asking for an exception to equitable tolling, or are you argue -- arguing that these claims are not equitably tolled because there was not diligence with respect to them? Well, I don't think they -- I don't think they made that concession. I don't think that's a fair characterization of their argument. And I -- I don't know whether I agree with their argument or not, but I don't think that's the -- that's the argument. The argument is basically this: You've got a statute of limitations. The courts have to follow it, like it or not. Now how does a court justify allowing somebody to file a claim after the statute of limitations has run? And the theory, they say, is that there was this old doctrine of equitable tolling, and when Congress enacted the statute of limitations, it did so with the understanding that it would be subject to the doctrine of equitable tolling. So, in order to allow the -- the case -- the claim to be filed after the statute of limitations has run, it has to fit within the doctrine of equitable tolling. And equitable tolling requires diligence and extraordinary circumstances. So you have to show that those are present in the case where a new class action is filed after the -- the expiration of the statute of limitations. If -- if, you know -- if you proceed from the assumption that their -- they -- that all of the members of the class had claims that were equitably tolled for all purposes, then, of course, your argument is a good one, but they don't proceed on the basis of that. That is not -- they do not concede that premise. You -- you argue that if the second -- let's say class certification is denied in the first case. Then a second case is brought. And the new district judge doesn't -- just says, well, I just think the first district judge was wrong and I don't care about -- I know -- I'm not going to accept that as a matter of comity. Is there any remedy for that? I -- I've never seen this as an enforceable -- you know, as an enforceable doctrine. I would think the second district judge would be perfectly right in saying: Look, I have to apply the law independently. And I'll give respectful consideration to what the first judge did, but if the first judge was wrong, I'm not going to follow what the first -- -- judge did. ",be you ask for an exception to equitable tolling or be you argue argue that these claim be not equitably toll because there be not diligence with respect to them well i do not think they i do not think they make that concession i do not think that be a fair characterization of their argument and i i do not know whether i agree with their argument or not but i do not think that be the that be the argument the argument be basically this you have get a statute of limitation the court have to follow it like it or not now how do a court justify allow somebody to file a claim after the statute of limitation have run and the theory they say be that there be this old doctrine of equitable tolling and when congress enact the statute of limitation it do so with the understanding that it would be subject to the doctrine of equitable tolling so in order to allow the the case the claim to be file after the statute of limitation have run it have to fit within the doctrine of equitable tolling and equitable tolling require diligence and extraordinary circumstance so you have to show that those be present in the case where a new class action be file after the the expiration of the statute of limitation if if you know if you proceed from the assumption that their they that all of the member of the class have claim that we be equitably toll for all purpose then of course your argument be a good one but they do not proceed on the basis of that that be not they do not concede that premise you you argue that if the second let us say class certification be deny in the first case then a second case be bring and the new district judge do not just say well i just think the first district judge be wrong and i do not care about i know I be not go to accept that as a matter of comity be there any remedy for that i I have never see this as an enforceable you know as an enforceable doctrine i would think the second district judge would be perfectly right in say look i have to apply the law independently and I will give respectful consideration to what the first judge do but if the first judge be wrong I be not go to follow what the first judge do ,137.28,Roberts Court,"Mar 26, 2018","China Agritech, Inc.","Michael H.

Well, Mr. Hellman, I -- I mean, I share the -- your -- your concern that if this statute is read in its broadest possible literal sense, it has a really staggering sweep, but I wonder if your interpretation really solves the problem because can't the same sorts of things happen after a proceeding has commenced? Let's say somebody is being audited and eventually the person comes up with the records that the auditor needs, but they're all scrambled up, and it looks like -- and -- and the person is -- is late in providing them and misses meetings and just is very difficult. You could get the same situation there, couldn't you? But before you go on, what do you do with the term ""impede""? Well, I don't know whether it is. The -- the dictionary definition of ""impede"" is: Interfere with or slow the progress of. So anything that makes the work of the IRS more difficult impedes the work of the IRS. Why? Why? Why do you disagree with that? On what basis? You have the mens rea. What do you have besides the mens rea? That's the mens rea. What do you have besides the mens rea? Well, where does this come from in the language of the statute? I mean, this -- that's what troubles me about this. If I read ""impede"" to mean what it means in ordinary language, slow the progress of, you don't even have to impede. It's enough that you endeavor to impede. The only limiting thing I see here is ""corruptly."" And, you know, the old, you know, the old saying, it's lawful for taxpayers to avoid taxes but not to evade taxes. So the line is -- the line can be very -- can be very thin. Well, let me just give you a variation of the hypothetical that's already been given. So somebody -- somebody offers to clean my gutters, and he says $100 cash, $125 if you pay me by check. Is that a violation of this? Why -- why not? What if I -- what if I -- you know, I understand why he's going to give me the discount by paying by cash, because he doesn't want to report it. Why? Why isn't that sufficient in itself? Well, before you move off that point, why should we be comforted by the fact that prosecutorial discretion can be used in applying a statute, if this is a statute, with a really broad reach so that it reaches a lot of rather trivial conduct? Doesn't that make the situation worse rather than better? So then the prosecutors can decide where they want to use this.

2017,Abbott v. Perez,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","What would have happened if you had told the district court, well, fine, you've issued an opinion, but we're going ahead and we're going to conduct elections under the map that was adopted by the state legislature? What would have happened? Do you think we lack jurisdiction if the order doesn't contain the word ""injunction"" or ""order"" but has the practical effect of doing that? Well, as to the district -- as to the congressional districts that are at issue here to start, did the district court simply rubber-stamp what had been presented to it, or did it engage in a pretty thorough, thoughtful analysis of the legality of those districts? Why don't you talk about one of the districts. Why don't we talk about Congressional District 35 and some of the points that the district court made when it initially analyzed this. Is it not true that this -- this -- the concept of this district was recommended by the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund and supported by the Latino Redistricting Task Force? But they recommended this as one of the alternatives, right? Linking -- linking San Antonio and -- and Austin, and they said there was a community of interest. And the district court said that in its initial opinion, did it not? I thought there was evidence that there was racially polarized voting in the district as a whole. You offered evidence about Travis County. At the time it acted, it had the district court's opinion, did it not? Yeah. Isn't what we're looking at? Well, has there -- has there ever been appellate review of the district court's determination -- findings as to the 2011 plan? Do you -- do you think that we should just accept those findings as givens? If you're going to place a lot of weight on them, would we not have to review those? Well, we can ask General Keller that on rebuttal, but I didn't understand them to say that we agree that all of the findings that were made as to the 2011 plan were correct, and we don't wish to -- we -- we -- we accept them all. But what is your evidence that the state adopted the plan previously approved by the court for an invidious reason? The advice -- the advice of what? That it was preliminary? The original opinion was preliminary? Well, this would be very important going forward. You want us to hold that a -- a state can satisfy its Voting Rights Act obligations by creating a district where there is a mathematical majority, but that district would not perform for the election of the minority preferred candidate? Do you want us to hold that? I thought that's what you were just saying. Yeah, and did the district court find that? I thought the district court did not find that you can create two performing districts in Nueces County. Yeah, and to -- -- and to establish liability, is it not necessary to show that you could create another performing district? And did the district court find that you could do that, and is it not true that one of the plaintiffs' experts found that one of these districts, if you split Nueces County in half, would not perform one time in 35 elections and the other one -- in the other, it would perform seven times in 35 elections?

2017,Dahda v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","I -- I tried to -- Yeah, but in that situation, if the -- if there were interceptions beyond the period that's allowed by the statute, then -- then those would be suppressed under, I guess it's Subsection 1, right, so it was acquired illegally? But, you know, if we -- I mean, I tried to figure out where this ""insufficient on its face"" language came from, because it is somewhat curious. And I'm sure that you have probably researched this more thoroughly, but the best I could come up with was that it was taken from old Rule 41(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. So, if that's the case, should we look to the way that rule was applied? I mean, if you -- do you think that if this situation had been presented to the Congress that enacted the -- the 1968 legislation, which was basically anti-crime legislation, that they would have said, yes, in this case, Mr. Dahda can't be convicted even though what happened here had no effect whatsoever on him? If the -- if the -- if you were seeking to use a mobile -- a real mobile interception device, would that appear in the application? I mean, when this statute was enacted in 1968, there were no cell phones. So I would think that -- I'm not sure what -- under what circumstances the order would need to specify where the -- the -- the tap was going to be. It would have to -- it would have to say that you're authorized to tap a particular number which would be registered at a particular place so it would be taken care of otherwise. Would you need to have a -- would there be circumstances at that time where you needed a separate provision of the order specifying where? I mean, our legal system usually does not give a party relief based on a mistake that had absolutely no effect on the party. Now I understand that the provision that's directly at issue here is an exception to that. It is a -- it is a list. It's some kind of a -- there's some requirements that have to be in the warrant, and whether or not they had any effect whatsoever, the statute says that there has to be suppression. But when you have that kind of a rule that is purely a formal rule, would you not expect to find in the statute a very clear specification of the things that have to be in the warrant, a very clear checklist, so that somebody can be certain that all of those steps are -- are covered, even if they have no effect? ",i i try to yeah but in that situation if the if there we be interception beyond the period that be allow by the statute then then those would be suppress under i guess it be subsection right so it be acquire illegally but you know if we i mean i try to figure out where this insufficient on its face language come from because it be somewhat curious and I be sure that you have probably research this more thoroughly but the best i could come up with be that it be take from old rule e of the federal rule of criminal procedure so if that be the case should we look to the way that rule be apply i mean if you do you think that if this situation have be present to the congress that enact the the legislation which be basically anti crime legislation that they would have say yes in this case mr dahda can not be convict even though what happen here have no effect whatsoever on him if the if the if you we be seek to use a mobile a real mobile interception device would that appear in the application i mean when this statute be enact in there we be no cell phone so i would think that I be not sure what under what circumstance the order would need to specify where the the the tap be go to be it would have to it would have to say that you be authorize to tap a particular number which would be register at a particular place so it would be take care of otherwise would you need to have a would there be circumstance at that time where you need a separate provision of the order specify where i mean our legal system usually do not give a party relief base on a mistake that have absolutely no effect on the party now i understand that the provision that be directly at issue here be an exception to that it be a it be a list it be some kind of a there have some requirement that have to be in the warrant and whether or not they have any effect whatsoever the statute say that there have to be suppression but when you have that kind of a rule that be purely a formal rule would you not expect to find in the statute a very clear specification of the thing that have to be in the warrant a very clear checklist so that somebody can be certain that all of those step be be cover even if they have no effect ,161.44,Roberts Court,"Feb 21, 2018","Los Rovell Dahda, et al.",United States of America,17-43,"Oct 16, 2017","May 14, 2018",112,0.0,1.0,0.0,0

Alito, Jr.","I'd like, Mr. Wall, I'd like you to finish your answer, but I have a question I'd like to get in before your time expires, if I could just note that. Yeah, I just wanted to know what the -- what the Government's position is regarding the Norris-LaGuardia Act issue? Is it not before us, is it so closely tied to the NLRA issue that it is appropriate for us to decide it? Did you have an opportunity to brief it? What's your position on this? We have said that with respect to individual arbitration. Have we said that with respect to class arbitration? Well, I'm curious about the -- the point that has been made that the Board doesn't allow class proceedings. There must be a reason -- you must have some explanation for how that can be reconciled with your -- your position, but I'd like to know what it is. And the other question I have is, how do you draw a distinction between a -- an agreement precluding class arbitration and all of the other Rules of Civil Procedure that limit the ability of employees to engage in collective litigation? Well, wait a minute. Why -- you say that -- what is the scope of the -- of the right to engage in concerted activity? Why -- if that's the case, why would it not abrogate any limitation in the rules of procedure that predated the enactment of that? Well, I want to -- So -- so is the argument is that the -- that the -- that restrictions in Rule 23 abrogate Rule -- Section 7 because they were enacted later? Well, then I don't understand your answer. And what if the rules of the arbitral forum say no class arbitration? If that's the -- if that's the -- if that's the rule, you have not achieved very much because, instead of having an agreement that says no class, no class action, no class arbitration, you have an agreement requiring arbitration before the XYZ arbitration association, which has rules that don't allow class arbitration. On the right to -- if the right to engage in concerted activity includes the right to have -- to file a class action in federal court, how can an agreement provide that -- waive that right and require arbitration, even if arbitrations -- even if class arbitration is allowed, or can it not do that?

2017,Class v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Another situation in which we ask whether the -- a defendant is asserting the right not to be tried is in determining whether there's a right to a -- an interlocutory appeal. So would you say that if a right is one that can be protected through an interlocutory appeal, it would fall within this doctrine? That's one that can be appealed in -- in an interlocutory appeal. How about a speech or debate clause claim? That's -- that permits an interlocutory appeal. So, if a member of Congress is charged with a crime and pleads guilty, that member of Congress may then argue on appeal that the prosecution was blocked by the speech or debate clause. This is -- Is the question -- I'm sorry. Is the question what does the defendant implicitly concede by pleading guilty? And so you can understand Blackledge and Menna to say the defendant does not implicitly concede that my conviction is not barred by double jeopardy, for example, but you could understand the plea to implicitly concede I'm guilty of the offense for which I'm charged. And that would include facts and law as set out in -- in the case we were discussing. Now, if that is the proper understanding of Blackledge and Menna, where does your case stand? But the no power formulation doesn't seem to be very helpful for the reasons that are pointed out by -- by Justice Kennedy's question, because if it can be waived, then there's power to do it. So it has to be reformulated, I think, in another way. Well, it doesn't forever preclude him if it's waiveable. And I don't understand that -- your answer to that. At trial, a conviction after trial permits -- if a defendant's conviction after -- after a trial -- convicted after a trial, the defendant can -- can raise on appeal any issue that was preserved.

2017,Wilson v. Sellers,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Suppose that the -- the Georgia Supreme Court in this case had issued an order saying we affirm the decision below; our decision should not be taken as necessarily agreeing or disagreeing with the reasoning in the lower court's opinion. Would look-through be appropriate in that situation? Well, what if -- if that -- So you -- You can't say? So we -- we would -- we would presume that the state supreme court had adopted the reasoning of the lower court even though the supreme court said specifically that it didn't? Well, why would it be -- -- why would it be a ruse? I -- it seems to me that there is a general -- that that is the general practice of appellate courts in the United States. When a court summarily affirms the decision of the lower court, the summary affirmance is not taken as necessarily adopting the reasoning of the lower court. That's the meaning of our summary affirmances. That is the meaning, the established meaning of thousands and thousands of summary affirmances by federal district courts -- by federal courts of appeals. But that's a question of -- that's a question of Georgia law. That's not a question of Ylst -- Well, that's a very debatable -- that's a very debatable and -- and, I think, a dubious reading of both of those decisions. There's nothing in any of those decisions that says in determining, like in Foster, was the -- was -- was there a Batson violation. We didn't say we're going to consider only the things that were said by the lower state court; we're not going to consider anything else. Did we say that? Did it say that, though? Suppose -- suppose that there is a decision by a state intermediate court of appeals, and the majority rejects a claim for certain reasons, and there's a concurrence in the judgment that says we would also reject the claim -- or I would also reject the claim for a different reason, and then that decision is summarily affirmed by the state supreme court. What happens there? To what? Just to the majority? You would assume that the state supreme court relied on the reasoning of the majority and not the reasoning of the concurrence. And that -- and based on what? What would be the basis of that? What about the commonsense, well-known, well-used -- well-understood rule that a summary affirmance by an appellate court is not interpreted in this country as an adoption of the reasoning of the lower court? Well, it said -- didn't it -- I mean, it said a lot. I think it devoted about 30 pages to this. And I -- I suspect you think that some of the things that it said were wrong, but is it fair to say that in general it said, in fact, said over and over one of the reasons why we find no -- why -- why the judge found no prejudice is that taking into account all the evidence that it suggested is mitigating and all of the aggravating evidence -- and there was a lot of it here -- the addition of this mitigating evidence wouldn't change the outcome? Didn't the court say that? No, it wasn't, all right, it wasn't presented at trial, but it was presented to the habeas court. It wasn't mentioned. But does that mean it wasn't considered? I mean, it does seem like -- What is your answer to the argument that what you're asking the federal habeas court to do really is to grade the quality of the opinion that was written? I mean, so what if the -- what the habeas court did was this? They said this is all the evidence that is -- is proffered in mitigation, and this is all the evidence that was provided by the state in aggravation, and taking into account all the -- all the mitigation and all the aggravation, we conclude that there's no reasonable probability that a jury would have returned anything other than a sentence of death? Now, would that be -- would that be unreasonable because there isn't a detailed explanation? That does sound like grading -- -- so let me modify what I -- my hypothetical where there's no explanation, there's just a citation -- there's just a listing of mitigation and aggravation. There's a little bit of explanation. There are three sentences of explanation or there's a half a page of explanation. At what point does it become, would you say, okay, well, that's enough, it's reasonable? Where is the question of -- of Georgia law that is implicated here? It would be one thing if it were generally understood in Georgia that a summary affirmance by the state supreme court does not necessarily adopt the reasoning of the lower court. It would be another thing if it was the rule in Georgia or generally understood in Georgia that the opposite is true. So what do we do with that? Yeah. Because there is no -- is there a specific rule in Georgia? Is there a well-known practice in Georgia? Do we -- -- go that far in this case? I mean, this is not a case where anybody's arguing that the decision of the Georgia Supreme Court is a reasonable one based on some ground that was never raised by anybody below. The -- the contours of the dispute here are very well known. Deficient performance, which has largely dropped out, and the question of prejudice. So it's all about whether there was prejudice under Strickland. Do we have to have a -- do we have to decide in this case what would be the situation where the issue, the ground for affirmance was never raised at all below or where the ground for affirmance that -- that is attributed to the state supreme court is different from the basic ground for affirmance that was addressed by the district court -- by the -- by the lower state court? ",suppose that the the georgia supreme court in this case have issue an order say we affirm the decision below our decision should not be take as necessarily agree or disagree with the reasoning in

2017,Artis v. District of Columbia,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","The statute -- Does -- does ""toll"" and -- do ""toll"" and ""tolling"" mean the same thing? Yeah, well, let's look at the words of this particular statute, ""unless state law provides for a longer tolling period."" So does that refer only to those state statutes that suspend the period, or does it also include those state statutes that simply stop the clock? Well, I don't know it's a debatable -- a debatable position. I think you have to take a position on it because you're making a textual argument. And it's hard to make a textual argument that ""tolled"" means something different from ""tolling."" Most of the state statutes stop the clock. They don't suspend the period. So, unless tolling includes the stop-the-clock statutes, it doesn't do very much. And as Justice Kennedy's question pointed out, if it only includes the ones that suspend the tolling period, it does virtually nothing. Do you admit that there are definitions of the term ""toll"" that are consistent with Respondent's argument? If we look in dictionaries, are there not definitions that are consistent with their argument? Do you think there are any constitutional limitations on Congress's authority to extend state statutes of limitations? But why is your interpretation more appropriate under the necessary and proper clause than Respondent's? But what's notable about your argument so far this morning is that you haven't said one word about why your approach is more appropriate as a -- as a policy matter than the other. And, of course, it's not our job to adopt policy, but in determining, you know, keeping an eye on the Constitution and interpreting this provision, why is your approach more necessary? Why is it more justified under the necessary and proper clause than the Respondent's? What is the necessity in any sense of the word for your approach? Why is it more fitting? But the claim has already been filed in federal court. Why -- why does the -- the plaintiff need all that additional time to refile in state court or in this instance in the District? But is it necessary to your argument to -- that -- that it would be unconstitutional to do this? I -- I -- is federalism not a relevant concern in interpreting this statute in determining whether interpretation A or interpretation B is the correct interpretation? ",the statute do do toll and do toll and tolling mean the same thing yeah well let us look at the word of this particular statute unless state law provide for a longer tolling period so do that refer only to those state statute that suspend the period or do it also include those state statute that simply stop the clock well i do not know it be a debatable a debatable position i think you have to take a position on it because you be make a textual argument and it be hard to make a textual argument that toll mean something different from toll most of the state statute stop the clock they do not suspend the period so unless toll include the stop the clock statute it do not do very much and as justice kennedy s question point out if it only include the one that suspend the tolling period it do virtually nothing do you admit that there be definition of the term toll that be consistent with respondent s argument if we look in dictionary be there not definition that be consistent with their argument do you think there be any constitutional limitation on congress s authority to extend state statute of limitation but why be your interpretation more appropriate under the necessary and proper clause than respondent s but what be notable about your argument so far this morning be that you have not say one word about why your approach be more appropriate as a as a policy matter than the other and of course it be not our job to adopt policy but in determine you know keep an eye on the constitution and interpret this provision why be your approach more necessary why be it more justified under the necessary and proper clause than the respondent s what be the necessity in any sense of the word for your approach why be it more fitting but the claim have already be file in federal court why why do the the plaintiff need all that additional time to refile in state court or in this instance in the district but be it necessary to your argument to that that it would be unconstitutional to do this i i be federalism not a relevant concern in interpret this statute in determine whether interpretation a or interpretation b be the correct interpretation ,145.08,Roberts Court,"Nov 1, 2017",Stephanie C.

2017,United States v. Microsoft Corporation,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Mr. Dreeben, do you think that -- do you think there's anything -- that the Stored Communications Act prevents you from obtaining this information in either of the two conventional ways that you mentioned? One, by getting a grand jury subpoena. If the Stored Communications Act simply doesn't apply here, could you go to a grand jury and get a grand jury subpoena or, two, conduct the kind of search that you just referred to? And if you did that, would Microsoft have any opportunity to contest that search? Could I ask you one other question? What is happening when these orders are sought now outside of the Second Circuit? I mean, there's been talk about leaving things alone, but is the rest of the country going -- are the judges everywhere in the country going to follow what the Second Circuit decided? Are they doing that, or are they continuing to issue the kinds of orders that were issued in the past? What is happening when these district courts outside of the Second Circuit are issuing these orders? The Internet service providers are not appealing? Mr. Rosenkranz, let me -- this is what troubles me. It would be good if Congress enacted legislation that modernized this, but in the interim, something has to be done. So what happens in this situation? I mean, there's an American citizen who's being investigated for crimes committed in the United States. The government shows probable cause that there is evidence of this crime in e-mails that are in the possession of an American Internet service provider. And there they have an urgent need for the information. But the provider has chosen to store the data overseas and, in fact, in some instances, has actually broken it up into shards so that it's stored not just in one foreign country but in a number of foreign countries. Now what -- what happens in that situation? There is no way in which the information can be obtained except by pursuing MLATs against multiple countries, a process that could -- that will take many months, maybe years? What happens? Well, we were told that that's what Gmail does. That's not correct? All right. Well, all right. The service provider has chosen to store it overseas. There's no way to get the information, other than through these -- these very time-consuming MLAT procedures? And what could -- and what could you do about it? What kind of -- -- what kind of suit would that be? But anyway, never mind. Is it correct that we don't know the nationality of the individual who has this e-mail account? Well, if this person is not Irish and Ireland played no part in your decision to store the information there and there's nothing that Ireland could do about it if you chose tomorrow to move it someplace else, it is a little difficult for me to see what Ireland's interest is in this. And I guess the point is when we're talking about this information, which, all right, yes, it -- it physically exists on one or more computers somewhere, but it doesn't have a presence anyplace in the sense that a physical object has a presence someplace. And the Internet service providers can put it anywhere they want and move it around at will. The whole idea of territoriality is strained. Wouldn't you agree with that? No, but, Mr. Rosenkranz -- -- I think the question is this: If this information were in Redmond, Washington, would the magistrate judge be unable to issue the order because Redmond, Washington, is not in New York? That's the question. ",mr dreeben do you think that do you think there be anything that the stored communication act prevents you from obtain this information in either of the two conventional way that you mention one by get a grand jury subpoena if the stored communication act simply do not apply here could you go to a grand jury and get a grand jury subpoena or two conduct the kind of search that you just refer to and if you do that would microsoft have any opportunity to contest that search could i ask you one other question what be happen when these order be seek now outside of the second circuit i mean there be be talk about leave thing alone but be the rest of the country go be the judge everywhere in the country go to follow what the second circuit decide be they do that or be they continue to issue the kind of order that we be issue in the past what be happen when these district court outside of the second circuit be issue these order the internet service provider be not appeal mr rosenkranz let me this be what troubles me it would be good if congress enact legislation that modernize this but in the interim something have to be do so what happen in this situation i mean there be an american citizen who be be investigate for crime commit in the united state the government show probable because that there be evidence of this crime in e mail that be in the possession of an american internet service provider and there they have an urgent need for the information but the provider have choose to store the data overseas and in fact in some instance have actually break it up into shard so that it be store not just in one foreign country but in a number of foreign country now what what happen in that situation there be no way in which the information can be obtain except by pursue mlats against multiple country a process that could that will take many month maybe year what happen well we we be tell that that be what gmail do that be not correct all right well all right the service provider have choose to store it overseas there be no way to get the information other than through these these very time consume mlat procedure and what could and what could you do about it what kind of what kind of suit would that be but anyway never mind be it correct that we do not know the nationality of the individual who have this e mail account well if this person be not irish and ireland play no part in your decision to store the information there and there be nothing that ireland could do about it if you choose tomorrow to move it someplace else it be a little difficult for me to see what ireland s interest be in this and i guess the point be when we be talk about this information which all right yes it it physically exist on one or more computer somewhere but it do not have a presence anyplace in the sense that a physical object have a presence someplace and the internet service provider can put it anywhere they want and move it around at will the whole idea of territoriality be strain would not you agree with that no but mr rosenkranz i think the question be this if this information we be in redmond washington would the magistrate judge be unable to issue the order because redmond washington be not in new york that be the question ,227.80000000000004,Roberts Court,"Feb 27, 2018",United States of America,Microsoft Corporation,17-2,"Oct 16, 2017","Apr 17, 2018",112,1.0,1.0,0.0,1

2017,"Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission",112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","What would you say about an architectural design? Is that entitled to -- not entitled to First Amendment protection because one might say that the primary purpose of the design of a building is to create a place where people can live or work? You mean an architectural design is not protected? You know, General, my -- my colleagues I think go to more elite restaurants than I do, but my -- (Laughter.) I -- I -- I think that if -- If -- if in my -- if in my dreams I could go to a Michelin, I don't know, one-tenth star, I don't know, two-star restaurant, and there was a menu of wonderful dishes created by the chef with -- with great creativity, and I said I really don't want any of these. Here is the recipe. I -- I want you to make this for me. Do you think he'd do that? He's serving up -- he creates something when he makes -- when he devises those dishes and when somebody comes in and asks to buy one, he is just mechanically producing another example of the thing that he created earlier. I mean, one thing that's -- I mean, one thing that's disturbing about the record here, in addition to the statement made, the statement that Justice Kennedy read, which was not disavowed at the time by any other member of the Commission, is what appears to be a practice of discriminatory treatment based on viewpoint. The -- the Commission had before it the example of three complaints filed by an individual whose creed includes the traditional Judeo-Christian opposition to same-sex marriage, and he requested cakes that expressed that point of view, and those -- there were bakers who said no, we won't do that because it is offensive. And the Commission said: That's okay. It's okay for a baker who supports same-sex marriage to refuse to create a cake with a message that is opposed to same-sex marriage. But when the tables are turned and you have a baker who opposes same-sex marriage, that baker may be compelled to create a cake that expresses approval of same-sex marriage. No, but Mr. -- Mr. Phillips -- Mr. Phillips would not -- do you disagree with the fact that he would not sell to anybody a wedding cake that expresses approval of same-sex marriage? No, he didn't say the identity. He said the message. He said the message. But it wouldn't at the time. It did not at the time. That is -- this is very odd. We're thinking about this case as it might play out in 2017, soon to be 2018, but this took place in 2012. So, if Craig and Mullins had gone to a state office and said we want a marriage license, they would not have been accommodated. If they said: Well, we want you to recognize our Massachusetts marriage, the state would say: No, we won't accommodate that. Well, we want a civil union. Well, we won't accommodate that either. And yet, when he goes to this bake shop and he says I want a wedding cake, and the baker says, no, I won't do it, in part because same-sex marriage was not allowed in Colorado at the time, he's created a grave wrong. How does that all that fit together? No -- -- that's not right, Mr. Yarger. It's a disturbing feature of your brief because this case was decided on summary judgment, and, therefore, you have to view the facts in the light most favorable to Mr. Phillips. And the only thing he admitted and what was said in the undisputed -- the list of undisputed facts was he would not create -- he was very careful to use the word ""create."" Is that wrong? And we have a history of -- in the questioning by -- of Petitioners' counsel, we explored the line between speech and non-speech, but as I understand your position, it would be the same if what was involved here were words. Am I wrong? If he would put a particular form of words on a wedding cake, on a cake for one customer, he has to put the same form of words, the same exact words, on a wedding cake for any other customer, regardless of the context? So, if someone came in and said: I want a cake for -- to celebrate our wedding anniversary, and I want it to say November 9, the best day in history, okay, sells them a cake. Somebody else comes in, wants exactly the same words on the cake, he says: Oh, is this your anniversary? He says: No, we're going to have a party to celebrate -- celebrate Kristallnacht. He would have to do that? It's exactly the same words. Are the words on the cake expressive conduct or are they not speech? But you're -- Yeah, but -- What you just said, and -- and -- and I understand Mr. Yarger -- Yarger's position for Colorado to be the same, is that someone can be compelled to write particular words with which that person strongly disagrees. That's your -- that is your position, isn't it? There's a -- there are services, I was somewhat surprised to learn this, but weddings have become so elaborate, that will write custom wedding vows for you and custom wedding speeches. So somebody comes to one of these services and says: You know, we're not good with words, but we want you to write wedding -- a vow -- vows for our wedding, and the general idea we want to express is that we don't believe in God, we think that's a bunch of nonsense, but we're going to try to live our lives to make the world a better place. And the -- the person who's writing this is religious and says: I can't lend my own creative efforts to the expression of such a message. But you would say, well, it's too bad because you're a public accommodation. Am I right? Along the -- Along the same lines as the Chief Justice's question, would you say that Colorado can compel a religious college that -- whose creed opposes same-sex marriage to provide married student housing for a married same-sex couple or allow a same-sex wedding to be performed in the college chapel? That's not pure -- those are not pure speech -- Well, this is not a church. It's an educational -- it's a -- it's an independent educational institution with a religious heritage. And that's what they believe. So your answer is they would be -- -- they would be required to do it?

And that's what we have here. You said it's obtuse. That's flattering. (Laughter.) And we have very smart lawyers here who have come up with creative interpretations, but this is gibberish. It's -- it is just gibberish. It says -- the provision that was read says that the state courts have jurisdiction over federal claims, except as provided in Section 77p, which says nothing whatsoever about jurisdiction for state -- for federal claims. So what are -- what are we supposed to do with this? Do you really think that whoever wrote this removal provision thought about all this stuff that you're telling us now? I mean, they set out to do what you say this does, and they decided this is the way we're going to do it. It is SO far from reality that it really strains credulity. I mean, all the readings that everybody has given to all of these proceedings -- provisions are a stretch. (Laughter.) I'm serious.

What -- what sense does that make? If a plaintiff files a third -- files a claim in state court under a state law cause of action that mirrors the '33 Act in the -- in the respects that are set out in the statute, the state court can't entertain that. Am I right? Okay. Now given that, why in the world would Congress want the state court to be able to entertain the real thing, an actual '33 Act? I thought it -- what it wanted was it to be resolved under federal procedural law? Yeah, they wanted to -- they wanted to resolve in accordance with the PSLRA. Which wouldn't apply in state court. The whole mixed case thing doesn't make the first bit of sense to me, that you've got the federal -- you have the '33 Act claim and you have the prohibited state act claim in state court. So then the state court knows -- has no jurisdiction whatsoever. What's going to happen? The defendant moves to dismiss. The plaintiff says, okay, fine, I dismiss my -- my -- my state act claim. Or the judge is going to say, oh, it's too late. You combined them to start out. The whole thing is dismissed. And then, if the statute of limitations hasn't run, the plaintiff can just come back and file the federal -- the '33 Act claim in state court by itself. Right?

2017,Sessions v. Dimaya,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","If the Court -- if the Court were to hold that 16(b) is unconstitutionally vague in criminal cases, what would the impact -- in criminal cases involving the application of the categorical approach, what would the -- what would the implications of that be? What would be some of the most important examples? Mr. Rosenkranz, could I ask you this: Suppose Congress enacted a statute that said any person who commits a crime of moral turpitude in the District of Columbia or with -- within the special or maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the United States shall be imprisoned for not more than 20 years, would that be unconstitutionally vague? But that seems to me -- I mean, I'm surprised by -- somewhat surprised by your answer. That seems to me to be at least as vague as 16(b) And yet the holding in the Jordan case on which you rely was that that -- that a -- a deportation statute that permitted deportation for a person convicted of a crime of moral turpitude satisfied the applicable vagueness standard there. So -- But, I mean, unless you're willing to say that the criminal statute that I hypothesized would satisfy vagueness standards, I -- I don't see how you can say that the same vagueness standard applies in criminal cases and deportation cases. So why does crime -- then the statute making a crime of saying anyone who commits a crime of moral turpitude sentenced to 20 -- up to 20 years, that would be -- that would satisfy vagueness for a criminal statute? What -- is DUI a crime of moral turpitude? How about failure to file an income tax return? How about unlawful entry into the United States? I mean, if that's your answer, it totally ignores that this is not a criminal case. And it certainly is true that deportation has more severe consequences than the typical civil case. But there are many other civil cases that can have a devastating impact on someone, such as child custody, loss of a professional license, complete destruction of a business, loss of the home. Now, assuming that there is some sort of vagueness standard that applies in civil cases, I would have thought your answer would be that it's a sliding scale and that the -- the standard for civil cases is not the same as the standard for criminal cases. But how much specificity is required in the civil context depends on the severity of the consequences of the case. No. That's not exactly the way the Court -- what the Court said, or at least it's not necessary to read Jordan that way. I think Jordan can be read to say, look, the dissent has raised this new argument, it wasn't briefed, it wasn't argued. The dissent says this is unconstitutionally vague; we are going to apply the criminal standard here and it satisfies the criminal standard. It -- it didn't say assume for the sake of argument, but I think it can certainly be read that way. And if you don't read it that way, you are stuck with a conclusion that a statute making a crime of moral turpitude punishable by a felony term of imprisonment would satisfy the vagueness standard for a criminal statute, which I think is very difficult to defend. Well, would you say the same thing if it didn't -- if this statute did not incorporate a definition that is also used in criminal statutes and simply had the same standard in a purely immigration statute? So no reference to a -- a definition that also applies in criminal cases. I don't think that makes the slightest bit of sense. Suppose there were a criminal statute that says that it is a crime -- it is a felony to charge an unjust rate. And then the -- there was a civil statute that incorporated that, and we would say, well, because you can't make it a felony to charge an -- an unjust rate or price. You can't have that in the civil statute. You can't incorporate it into the civil statute. ",if the court if the court we be to hold that b be unconstitutionally vague in criminal case what would the impact in criminal case involve the application of the categorical approach what would the what would the implication of that be what would be some of the most important example mr rosenkranz could i ask you this suppose congress enact a statute that say any person who commit a crime of moral turpitude in the district of columbia or with within the special or maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the united state shall be imprison for not more than year would that be unconstitutionally vague but that seem to me i mean I be surprise by somewhat surprised by your answer that seem to me to be at least as vague as b and yet the holding in the jordan case on which you rely be that that that a a deportation statute that permit deportation for a person convict of a crime of moral turpitude satisfy the applicable vagueness standard there so but i mean unless you be willing to say that the criminal statute that i hypothesize would satisfy vagueness standard i i do not see how you can say that the same vagueness standard applies in criminal case and deportation case so why do crime then the statute make a crime of say anyone who commit a crime of moral turpitude sentence to up to year that would be that would satisfy vagueness for a criminal statute what be dui a crime of moral turpitude how about failure to file an income tax return how about unlawful entry into the united state i mean if that be your answer it totally ignore that this be not a criminal case and it certainly be true that deportation have more severe consequence than the typical civil case but there be many other civil case that can have a devastating impact on someone such as child custody loss of a professional license complete destruction of a business loss of the home now assume that there be some sort of vagueness standard that apply in civil case i would have think your answer would be that it be a slide scale and that the the standard for civil case be not the same as the standard for criminal case but how much specificity be require in the civil context depend on the severity of the consequence of the case no that be not exactly the way the court what the court say or at least it be not necessary to read jordan that way i think jordan can be read to say look the dissent have raise this new argument it be not brief it be not argue the dissent say this be unconstitutionally vague we be go to apply the criminal standard here and it satisfy the criminal standard it it do not say assume for the sake of argument but i think it can certainly be read that way and if you do not read it that way you be stick with a conclusion that a statute make a crime of moral turpitude punishable by a felony term of imprisonment would satisfy the vagueness standard for a criminal statute which i think be very difficult to defend well would you say the same thing if it do not if this statute do not incorporate a definition that be also use in criminal statute and simply have the same standard in a purely immigration statute so no reference to a a definition that also apply in criminal case i do not think that make the slight bit of sense suppose there we be a criminal statute that say that it be a crime it be a felony to charge an unjust rate and then the there be a civil statute that incorporate that and we would say well because you can not make it a felony to charge an an unjust rate or price you can not have that in the civil statute you can not incorporate it into the civil statute ,250.02,Roberts Court,"Jan 17, 2017","Jefferson B.

2017,Byrd v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","And what if the -- what if the rental agreement said that if any unauthorized person uses the car, we consent to a search by the police? So if -- if they had called Budget and Budget had said it's okay to search our car because Mr. Byrd is not authorized to drive it, that would be all right? Well, if that's the case -- I don't know what Budget's policy is on this. It might well be Budget's policy that we want the police to search a car if they stop it and it's driven by somebody who is not authorized to drive it. Well, you mentioned the rental situation. What about this: A homeowner is going away for a long weekend, arranges with a teenager in the neighborhood to come in and walk and feed the cat and spend quality time with the cat -- (Laughter.) -- but says under no circumstances may you bring anybody else into the house. But the teen -- and the teenager says okay, fine, and then goes ahead and gives the keys to a friend who uses the house to sell drugs, and the police come in and they conduct a search. Can that trespasser claim that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated? I mean, what's the -- what is the difference between the -- the -- the kid who's selling drugs from the house and Mr. Byrd who's using the car to transport drugs? But the problem -- The problem -- go ahead. I mean, the problem with going down this property route is that we go off in search of a type of case that almost never arose, if it ever did arose -- arise at common law, where an unauthorized sub-bailee brings an action for trespass to chattel against a law enforcement officer. When would that ever have happened in 18th-century America? Never. Yeah. It's -- It's hard enough to find the case where it's the stranger, where it's the private-party stranger. But that's not what we have here. We have a party who has lawful rights that no private party had, which was to stop this vehicle. And it's not contested that this was a lawful -- that this was a lawful search. I mean, I'm sorry, a lawful stop. The Constitution uses the word ""property"" numerous times, but the word ""property"" doesn't appear in the Fourth Amendment. It talks about ""effects,"" which is defined by Samuel Johnson's dictionary as ""goods or movables."" So is it your argument that any property interest whatsoever falls within the definition of ""effects"" if we are going to go back to an originalist interpretation of the Fourth Amendment? So would it include contingent interests? Would it include future interests? If somebody has left me a car in a will and the car is searched, do I have the right to bring a Fourth -- does that implicate my Fourth Amendment rights? Well, there was a -- There was a violation of one of the terms of the contract. We asked Mr. Loeb about where he would draw the line. But where would you draw the line in terms of terms -- with regard to terms in the contract? Would you say that every violation of a term of the rental agreement voids the opportunity to make a Fourth Amendment argument? And then what do you do about the cases with the -- the illegal sublessee or the individuals who occupy a rental unit in violation of a provision that specifies the maximum number of people who can stay there? What about other criminal activity? So why do you draw a line between a criminal trespasser and somebody who has an open -- an open bottle of alcohol in the car, or someone who gets in the car intoxicated or someone who is ingesting other control -- controlled substances in the car? Or somebody who doesn't have a license. ",and what if the what if the rental agreement say that if any unauthorized person use the car we consent to a search by the police so if if they have call budget and budget have say it be okay to search our car because mr byrd be not authorize to drive it that would be all right well if that be the case i do not know what budget s policy be on this it might well be budget s policy that we want the police to search a car if they stop it and it be drive by somebody who be not authorize to drive it well you mention the rental situation what about this a homeowner be go away for a long weekend arrange with a teenager in the neighborhood to come in and walk and fee the cat and spend quality time with the cat laughter but say under no circumstance may you bring anybody else into the house but the teen and the teenager say okay fine and then go ahead and give the key to a friend who use the house to sell drug and the police come in and they conduct a search can that trespasser claim that his fourth amendment right we be violate i mean what be the what be the difference between the the the kid who be sell drug from the house and mr byrd who be use the car to transport drug but the problem the problem go ahead i mean the problem with go down this property route be that we go off in search of a type of case that almost never arise if it ever do arise arise at common law where an unauthorized sub bailee bring an action for trespass to chattel against a law enforcement officer when would that ever have happen in th century america never yeah it be it be hard enough to find the case where it be the stranger where it be the private party stranger but that be not what we have here we have a party who have lawful right that no private party have which be to stop this vehicle and it be not contest that this be a lawful that this be a lawful search i mean I be sorry a lawful stop the constitution use the word property numerous time but the word property do not appear in the fourth amendment it talk about effect which be define by samuel johnson s dictionary as good or movable so be it your argument that any property interest whatsoever fall within the definition of effect if we be go to go back to an originalist interpretation of the fourth amendment so would it include contingent interest would it include future interest if somebody have leave me a car in a will and the car be search do i have the right to bring a fourth do that implicate my fourth amendment right well there be a there be a violation of one of the term of the contract we ask mr loeb about where he would draw the line but where would you draw the line in term of term with regard to term in the contract would you say that every violation of a term of the rental agreement voids the opportunity to make a fourth amendment argument and then what do you do about the case with the the illegal sublessee or the individual who occupy a rental unit in violation of a provision that specify the maximum number of people who can stay there what about other criminal activity so why do you draw a line between a criminal trespasser and somebody who have an open an open bottle of alcohol in the car or someone who get in the car intoxicate or someone who be ingest other control control substance in the car or somebody who do not have a license ,255.95999999999995,Roberts Court,"Jan 9, 2018",Terrence Byrd,United States of America,16-1371,"Sep 28, 2017","May 14, 2018",112,1.0,1.0,1.0,1

So what if the court goes through each of the 3553(a) factors and says, well, you know, as to (A), it's a serious offense and it's serious enough to warrant a sentence of 114 months, and we need to have adequate deterrence, and I think 114 months is the amount that you need for adequate deterrence and so forth? Would that be enough? Why would this preclude appellate review? Isn't it pretty obvious what -- or couldn't the court of appeals infer that what the district court did was this: The district court originally thought 135 months was the right sentence -- that was the original sentence, right, 135? All right. And so the district court thought: Well, the -- the range was lowered, and so I'm going to go down to 114, but taking into account the sentencing factors, I don't think it should go below 114. And I think that's the -- I don't know that you need to spell all that out. And if -- if that's what the court said, would that be sufficient? And, if that would be sufficient, why can't there be appellate review, just as -- based on what was done here? Well, why doesn't it tie it to the 3553(a) factors? There's nothing -- there isn't an algorithm that tells you how to put those factors together or to quantify each one. It's the judge takes into account the various factors, the seriousness of the offense, deterrence and so forth, and says this is the right number. What would be the minimum that would suffice here? Well, you're asking us to impose a standard. And -- and you could -- I -- I think it's entirely fair to ask you what would be the minimum that would be required. So you gave me an answer.

2017,Currier v. Virginia,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, what to default -- To sort of bracket this problem, what about a jurisdiction like the U.S. courts, where severance is not required, where there's -- says nothing about severance? All right. Well, take the -- take the -- the model of the jurisdiction that says nothing about severance of -- of -- of this claim -- of charges like these. But there is no issue preclusion clause in the Constitution. There's the -- the double jeopardy provision of the Fifth Amendment, which says that no ""person shall be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb."" So isn't Ashe -- doesn't Ashe simply provide one definition of the same offense? Yeah, but in Jeffers, the Court held that when the second trial involves the same offense under the Blockburger test and the defendant consents, the second trial can go forward. So why should it not follow that when the defendant consents, if, in fact, that is done, and the second trial involves the same offense under Ashe, this rule should be the same? But wouldn't it be odd to say that the defendant in Jeffers has a lesser double jeopardy right when what he is asserting is consistent with what the Double Jeopardy Clause was originally understood to mean, whereas, in a situation like this, what the defendant is asserting is something that was developed by our cases in the modern era but was not what the Double Jeopardy Clause was originally intended to mean. So, when the defendant is asserting the core double jeopardy right and says, I want a second trial, there can be a second trial, but when the defendant is asserting this new elaboration of the right, there can't be a second trial. Isn't that rather odd? But do you think the result -- I'm sorry. Finish your sentence. Is -- is there anything to indicate that the result would be different -- would have been different in Jeffers if the first trial had been an acquittal? Yeah. He said -- He said it later. But the Double Jeopardy Clause doesn't draw a distinction between convictions and -- and acquittals, does it? And the Commonwealth could have proved the second offense without making any reference to the breaking and entering of the residence or the theft of the safe. They could have called Wood and they say: Where were you on such and such a date, such and such a time? I was by the river. And what were you doing? I had a safe with guns and money. And was -- were you by yourself? No. Petitioner was with me. And what did he do? He took out the guns and he was possessing the guns. They could have done that. But I bet if they had done -- I don't think Mr. Fisher would say that that would be okay. I think he would say that would still be barred by -- by issue preclusion. And if that is the case and the defense understood at the time when they agreed to the second trial that the prosecution would not be able to prove the second offense in that way, then I don't see why they didn't understand the consequences of agreeing to the second trial with respect to issue preclusion to exactly the same extent as they understood the consequences with respect to a -- a second trial in the Jeffers situation. But could the -- could the Commonwealth have proven the second charge the way that I suggested during the prior argument -- -- by making no reference to the breaking and entering or the larceny -- Well, why would it not -- -- why would it not? It proves all the elements of the offense. I think what you just said, I don't want to belabor the point, but it does seem to me inconsistent with the Second Circuit's opinion in Kramer that you relied on pretty heavily. No, I read it. But you could have -- they could have proven the -- the -- the second offense without making any reference to what had happened in the other -- in the other offense. ",well what to default to sort of bracket this problem what about a jurisdiction like the us court where severance be not require where there be say nothing about severance all right well take the take the the model of the jurisdiction that say nothing about severance of of of this claim of charge like these but there be no issue preclusion clause in the constitution there be the the double jeopardy provision of the fifth amendment which say that no person shall be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb so be not ashe do not ashe simply provide one definition of the same offense yeah but in jeffers the court hold that when the second trial involve the same offense under the blockburger test and the defendant consent the second trial can go forward so why should it not follow that when the defendant consent if in fact that be do and the second trial involve the same offense under ashe this rule should be the same but would not it be odd to say that the defendant in jeffers have a lesser double jeopardy right when what he be assert be consistent with what the double jeopardy clause be originally understood to mean whereas in a situation like this what the defendant be assert be something that be develop by our case in the modern era but be not what the double jeopardy clause be originally intend to mean so when the defendant be assert the core double jeopardy right and say i want a second trial there can be a second trial but when the defendant be assert this new elaboration of the right there can not be a second trial be not that rather odd but do you think the result I be sorry finish your sentence be be there anything to indicate that the result would be different would have be different in jeffers if the first trial have be an acquittal yeah he say he say it later but the double jeopardy clause do not draw a distinction between conviction and and acquittal do it and the commonwealth could have prove the second offense without make any reference to the breaking and entering of the residence or the theft of the safe they could have call wood and they say where we be you on such and such a date such and such a time i be by the river and what we be you do i have a safe with gun and money and be we be you by yourself no petitioner be with me and what do he do he take out the gun and he be possess the gun they could have do that but i bet if they have do i do not think mr fisher would say that that would be okay i think he would say that would still be bar by by issue preclusion and if that be the case and the defense understood at the time when they agree to the second trial that the prosecution would not be able to prove the second offense in that way then i do not see why they do not understand the consequence of agree to the second trial with respect to issue preclusion to exactly the same extent as they understand the consequence with respect to a a second trial in the jeffers situation but could the could the commonwealth have prove the second charge the way that i suggest during the prior argument by make no reference to the breaking and entering or the larceny well why would it not why would it not it prove all the element of the offense i think what you just say i do not want to belabor the point but it do seem to me inconsistent with the second circuit s opinion in kramer that you rely on pretty heavily no i read it but you could have they could have prove the the the second offense without make any reference to what have happen in the other in the other offense ,233.79999999999995,Roberts Court,"Feb 20, 2018",Michael N.

2017,Husted v. A. Philip Randolph Institute,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Why do you need the -- Why do you need the proximate cause argument at all? What the statute says is that you -- someone may not be removed from the list by reason of the person's failure to vote. It can't mean but-for cause because then it would run -- because the -- the statute itself takes failure to vote into account in (d). That's one of the things that is necessary in order for someone to be removed from the list under (d). So it can't be but-for. And in the HAVA, Congress used the term ""solely."" So why isn't the best interpretation of this that one cannot be removed from the list solely because of failure to vote? And I'm looking at -- I'm listening -- And I'm missing -- I'm sorry. Well, wasn't it -- wasn't it itself considered to be a ground for being removed? It wasn't necessarily -- these states didn't regard it necessarily as a proxy for anything else. They just took the position that it was use it or lose it. If you didn't vote for a certain period of time, that was grounds for taking your name off the eligibility list. Well, your argument is that failure to vote is not one of the listed grounds for being removed, right? That's -- that's the argument you just made. But is that what Ohio does? Does it say the failure to vote is a ground for removal, or does it say that moving out of the district is a ground for removal, and failure to vote plays a part in the determination of whether a person has moved out of the district? It's evidentiary. It's not the -- the ground for removal in and of itself. Yeah, I understand that. My -- I wonder what your answer would be to this: Suppose the state statute said that if you have not voted for 20 years, then we're going to send out the notice. Would you say that that violates this Act? You think that if somebody hasn't voted for 20 years, that doesn't raise an inference that the person has moved or died? In and of itself, but, I mean, that isn't enough even to spark an inquiry by sending a -- a postcard saying if, in fact, you've just decided you didn't want to vote for 20 years, but you really want to keep your name on the list, and you're still in the district, send this back. That would be illegal? But if not getting the notice back tells you nothing, why did Congress make that part of the determination? I mean, this is a very -- it's a very important subject. It's a sensitive subject. There are -- as a policy matter, there are strong arguments on both sides. Congress had struck a compromise. What we have before us is a question of statutory interpretation, not a question of what we think would be the ideal system for achieving the result of removing people who have moved from the voter lists. And you haven't said very much about the language of the statute. How do you get -- if ""by reason of a person's failure to vote"" is not but-for cause, how do you get around the language of (b)(2)? But that actually isn't what (b)(2) says. It does not say you can't use failure to vote as a reason for removing someone, except that you can do what is set out in --- in (c) and (d). What it says is that the principle that you can't use failure to vote as a reason for removing someone may not be construed to prohibit. So the -- it -- it tells you how to interpret the first part of (b)(2). It is not an exception to the first part of (b)(2). It says -- it says that -- that it's all right if you followed either (c) or (d). And what -- Well, it says -- you think you have to follow (c) and (d)? That's not what it says. You just told me that it doesn't matter how many years is required by the trigger. It could be 10. It could be 20. Well, where does the -- where does the statute say that? And -- -- and not voting for 20 years isn't good reason to think that they've moved? So what is your standard of causation? It's not -- it's not solely, it's not proximate cause. The only thing I can think of that's left is but-for. What's the difference -- Well, in HAVA, Congress used the term ""solely."" Could you say something about -- about that provision of -- of HAVA? That says that states shall include provisions. It's mandatory. To have a system of file maintenance that makes a reasonable effort to remove ineligible voters, and goes on to say, under this system, ""registrants who have not responded to a notice and who have not voted in two consecutive general elections for Federal office shall be removed from the official list of eligible voters."" By itself, that seems pretty clear. How do you get around that? Except -- but it -- it goes on to say: ""except that no registrant may be removed solely by reason of failure to vote."" Now, under Ohio's system, is someone removed solely because of failure to vote? So the notices -- there's no requirement -- if somebody doesn't vote forever but returns that notice, the person would be removed from the list? No, I understand that, but I don't see how that -- how that's solely. If somebody returns the notice, they never vote, but they return the notice, are they removed from the list? ",why do you need the why do you need the proximate because argument at all what the statute say be that you someone may not be remove from the list by reason of the person s failure to vote it can not mean but for because because then it would run because the the statute itself take failure to vote into account in d that be one of the thing that be necessary in order for someone to be remove from the list under d so it can not be but for and in the hava congress use the term solely so why be not the best interpretation of this that one can not be remove from the list solely because of failure to vote and I be look at I be listen and I be miss I be sorry well be not it be not it itself consider to be a ground for be remove it be not necessarily these state do not regard it necessarily as a proxy for anything else they just take the position that it be use it or lose it if you do not vote for a certain period of time that be ground for take your name off the eligibility list well your argument be that failure to vote be not one of the listed ground for be remove right that be that be the argument you just make but be that what ohio do do it say the failure to vote be a ground for removal or do it say that move out of the district be a ground for removal and failure to vote play a part in the determination of whether a person have move out of the district it be evidentiary it be not the the ground for removal in and of itself yeah i understand that my i wonder what your answer would be to this suppose the state statute say that if you have not vote for year then we be go to send out the notice would you say that that violate this act you think that if somebody have not vote for year that do not raise an inference that the person have move or die in and of itself but i mean that be not enough even to spark an inquiry by send a a postcard say if in fact you have just decide you do not want to vote for year but you really want to keep your name on the list and you be still in the district send this back that would be illegal but if not get the notice back tell you nothing why do congress make that part of the determination i mean this be a very it be a very important subject it be a sensitive subject there be as a policy matter there be strong argument on both side congress have strike a compromise what we have before us be a question of statutory interpretation not a question of what we think would be the ideal system for achieve the result of remove people who have move from the voter list and you have not say very much about the language of the statute how do you get if by reason of a person s failure to vote be not but for because how do you get around the language of b but that actually be not what b say it do not say you can not use failure to vote as a reason for remove someone except that you can do what be set out in in c and d what it say be that the principle that you can not use failure to vote as a reason for remove someone may not be construe to prohibit so the it it tell you how to interpret the first part of b it be not an exception to the first part of b it say it say that that it be all right if you follow either c or d and what well it say you think you have to follow c and d that be not what it say you just tell me that it do not matter how many year be require by the trigger it could be it could be well where do the where do the statute say that and and not vote for year be not good reason to think that they have move so what be your standard of causation it be not it be not solely it be not proximate because the only thing i can think of that be leave be but for what be the difference well in hava congress use the term solely could you say something about about that provision of of hava that say that state shall include provision it be mandatory to have a system of file maintenance that make a reasonable effort to remove ineligible voter and go on to say under this system registrant who have not respond to a notice and who have not vote in two consecutive general election for federal office shall be remove from the official list of eligible voter by itself that seem pretty clear how do you get around that except but it it go on to say except that no registrant may be remove solely by reason of failure to vote now under ohio s system be someone remove solely because of failure to vote so the notice there be no requirement if somebody do not vote forever but return that notice the person would be remove from the list no i understand that but i do not see how that how that be solely if somebody return the notice they never vote but they return the notice be they remove from the list ,313.49,Roberts Court,"Jan 10, 2018",Jon Husted,A.

If an inter partes review is instituted and not dismissed under this chapter, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board shall issue a final decision with respect to the patentability of any patent claim challenged by the petitioner. What is ambiguous about that? Well, that really wasn't my question. If we look at that language by itself, where is there ambiguity? You think that's -- you think that is a serious interpretation of this challenge -- they challenged it in a discussion in their office. They challenged it in a discussion in a bar. It means challenged it in this proceeding. What else could it mean? You think it's not hard? You think that's not a hard question at least? If Congress wanted to say what you think this means, why in the world would they phrase it the way it is phrased in 318(a)? Why wouldn't they say with respect to the patentability of any claim found by the director to have at least some likelihood of success? Or any claim on which review was granted? Why in the world would they say any patent claim challenged by the petitioner? But you think ""challenged by the petitioner"" is narrower than -- I'm sorry, any change -- ""any patent claim challenged by the petitioner"" is narrower than the -- the words that are used in 314? Is there anything in the statute that would prevent the Board, if it is required to render a final decision on all claims initially challenged by the Petitioner, from instituting a streamlined procedure for dealing with the claims that were found at the outset to have no likelihood of success?

2017,Jennings v. Rodriguez,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Assuming -- assuming that there is a constitutional limit of the type that's been discussed, is that -- do you think that can be addressed in a class action, or is it something that can be addressed only in individual habeas cases? Are you making a statutory argument? And the Ninth Circuit's decision was based on the -- an interpretation of the statute, wasn't it? So are you making a statutory argument or are you making a constitutional argument? Well, I understand that. But to me, at least, it makes a difference whether we're interpreting the statute or whether we're interpreting the Constitution. And I'll tell you, on the language of the statute, I think you have a pretty tough -- you have a pretty tough argument. Well, you can't -- you're -- is that a constitutional argument or a statutory argument? Constitutional avoidance isn't just sort of, well, we really don't think we can interpret the statute this way, but we don't have the guts to say that it's unconstitutional. So we're going to put the two things together and say, well, by constitutional avoidance -- -- is what it means -- this is what it means. So are you saying that 1226(a), the Patriot Act provision, makes the government's interpretation of 1226(c) superfluous? Well, there -- there are different -- there are quite noticeable differences between the two provisions, so I don't know how far this argument can go. For one thing, the -- the list of -- in 1226(a) -- (a) -- (a)(3)(A), there are listed one, two, three, four, five, six categories, and four of those are not included in the Patriot Act provision; isn't that right? That's one thing -- Yes. Okay. That's one thing. Under 1226(c)(1), the Attorney General shall take any -- shall take into custody any alien who under then sub (d) of that is inadmissible or deportable. So the person must be inadmissible or deportable. And under 1226(a), the Attorney General -- (a)(1)(A), the Attorney General -- well, what is it, (a)(3)(A), the Attorney General has reasonable grounds to believe. So it's a different standard. Well, but the decision of the Ninth Circuit was based on interpretation of this statute, and you want to go -- you want to -- you want to affirm on an alternative ground, which is that it's unconstitutional, so I don't know how far you can get with that argument. But we could -- if you want to be very strict about what's before us, we could simply say the Ninth Circuit's interpretation of the statute is wrong and remand for further proceedings to the Ninth Circuit. Do you think that the flight risk and danger to the community are both continuums? Well, so if you have the situation where the person is litigating in -- for -- in a -- there has been lengthy litigation, but the judge can't say this is done in bad faith or it's dilatory, it's just very lengthy and it keeps going on and on and on and on, and then you have a flight risk that's someplace on this scale and you have a risk to the community that's someplace on this scale, how can you address how something like that can come out -- should come out with any kind of a categorical role?

2017,Carpenter v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","How would you distinguish Miller? Why is it more -- why is it more sensitive? Why is cell site location information more sensitive than bank records, which particularly today, when a lot of people don't use cash much, if at all, a bank record will disclose purchases? It will not only disclose -- everything that the person buys, it will not only disclose locations, but it will disclose things that can be very sensitive. Yeah, I understand that. But why is that more sensitive than bank records that show, for example, periodicals to which a person -- to which a person subscribes or hotels where a person has stayed or entertainment establishments -- establishments that a person has visited -- -- and all sorts of other things. Well, you know, Mr. Wessler, I -- I agree with you that this new technology is raising very serious privacy concerns, but I need to know how much of existing precedent you want us to overrule or declare obsolete. And if I could, I'd just like to take you back briefly to -- to Miller and ask on what grounds that can be distinguished. You don't say we should overrule it, and you had -- you said the information here is more sensitive. We maybe could agree to disagree about that. I don't know. But what else? What -- on what other ground can Miller possibly be distinguished? Well, I mean, that's a debatable empirical point whether people realize what's -- what's going on, and there's reason to think maybe they do. I mean, people know, there -- there were all these commercials, ""can you hear me now,"" our company has lots of towers everywhere. What do they think that's about? The contract, the standard MetroPCS contract seems to say -- and I guess we don't have the actual contract in the record here -- does seem to say that -- advise the customer that we can disclose this information to the -- to the government if we get a court order. So I don't know whether that will hold up. And even if it were to hold up today, what will happen in the future if people -- everybody begins to realize that this is -- this is provided? If you have enough police TV shows where this is shown, then everybody will know about it, just like they know about CSI information. Except as provided by law. Suppose that in this -- suppose that in this case there was a subpoena for the -- the numbers called from the cell phone. Would there be a problem with that in your opinion? You think the numbers called, the people that somebody is calling is -- is less -- that's less sensitive than the person's location? How -- how are we going to judge the sensitivity of -- of information like this? Yeah, Mr. Dreeben, along those lines, I was trying to think of an example of a situation in which a person would have a property right in information that the person doesn't ask a third-party to create, the person can't force the third-party to create it or to gather it. The person can't prevent the company from gathering it. The person can't force the company to destroy it. The person can't prevent the company from destroying it. And according to Petitioner, the customer doesn't even have a right to get the information. Yeah, Mr. Dreeben, I would read the -- the -- the phrase ""customer proprietary information"" to mean that it is proprietary to the cell phone company and, therefore, not to the customer. It's customer information, but it's proprietary information about the cell phone company because, if you got that information in the aggregate, you could tell a lot about the company's operation. I assume that -- that that kind of information would be available to the FCC. And so, if the FCC obtained it, they would have to treat it as proprietary information of the company. Am I wrong in that? Well, if it were proprietary to the customer, in what sense is it proprietary to the customer, since it has all of those attributes that I mentioned? Now, yeah, Mr. Dreeben, in order to understand the issue here and to see the difference between this case and Jones, isn't it necessary to go back to old Supreme Court cases that describe -- that explain how the Fourth Amendment applies to a subpoena? Asking another -- asking a party or ordering a party to produce documents is not a search in the literal sense of the word, nor is it a seizure in the literal sense of the word, but cases going back to Boyd, and Hale versus Henkel, old cases say that it's a -- it's a constructive search. But in the situation where there's this constructive search, then the Fourth Amendment standards that apply to a literal search, what the Court called an actual search, are different. Isn't that -- so it's a fundamentally -- -- different framework. That's certainly true, but you'd want to -- so this is -- this would be revolutionary, to fundamentally change the understanding of the application of the Fourth Amendment to subpoenas. Do you want us to do that? No, I understand that, but you said in your brief that the -- that the companies wouldn't comply. Could I just ask you this question: Is any of this going to do any good for -- for Mr. Carpenter? (Laughter.) Is he going to get anything suppressed? Because under Illinois versus Krull, if -- if a search is conducted in reliance on a statute authorizing the search in accordance with a certain procedure, the exclusionary rule doesn't apply. No, I understand that. Just -- ",how would you distinguish miller why be it more why be it more sensitive why be cell site location information more sensitive than bank record which particularly today when a lot of people

2017,Rosales-Mireles v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","I mean, if we said that an error is plain if it creates a risk that the defendant will serve a longer sentence than the defendant would have otherwise served, I don't know what's left of the plain error rule in criminal cases. You -- you seem to be equating -- you seem to -- your argument seems to be that an error is plain unless it's harmless -- unless it is not harmless, isn't that right? Well, what is left of it in this context? I mean, you cite three examples in your brief. One is when the defendant has waived an objection to the guideline -- to the sentence in -- in a plea agreement. The other is when the defendant has already completed the sentence, in which case I think the case would be -- would be moot. There would be no opportunity to get relief in a direct appeal. And the other is when the -- the defendant is serving a concurrently running sentence. Do you have others? Okay. So, if there's any chance that the guideline error affected the sentence, then the error is plain? That's your argument? Okay. Now, if we were to apply that in other contexts, what would be left of the plain error rule in criminal cases? Okay. Error -- evidence is erroneously admitted at trial. It's hear -- it's hearsay and it's -- it's inadmissible hearsay. It's admitted. So there's an error. But the reviewing court says that the -- the harmless error standard for non-constitutional errors is met. But there is a chance that it had an effect on the -- on conviction. So why wouldn't that be a plain error? But you're changing the standard. You're changing the harmless error standard when you say that, aren't you? Well, my inquiry is what is the difference between the plain error rule and the harmless error rule as you understand them? And you just told me, as I -- what I think you just told me was that the court would have to say it's uncontroverted, that this had no effect, otherwise it would be plain error? Yeah, well, that ought to cut in the opposite direction, shouldn't it? The defendant has the burden under plain error, right, so it should be harder there. I -- I still don't -- I just don't understand what is left of the plain error rule. There doesn't seem to be very much left, if the only question is, is there any chance that it caused the defendant to serve a longer sentence than the defendant would have otherwise served? Well, if that's the correct formulation, then why -- why is a sentencing guidelines error more serious than any other type of error, more serious than a constitutional error, more serious than a violation of a statutory command? Here, we're not even talking about something that's mandatory. These guidelines exist in some kind of a middle universe that I -- I don't understand, but that's another -- that's another question. Why -- why is this different? Well, that ""shall"" is part of the mandatory regime. I thought that was declared unconstitutional in Booker. I mean, suppose a district judge said, all right, you know, there's a dispute about which -- what the guidelines range is, and one of the guidelines that's possible here has a range that includes the sentence of 60 months, and I have considered the statutory factors that I am supposed to consider in identifying a just and appropriate sentence and I think 60 months hits it right on the -- the head, and that's the sentence that I'm going to impose and I would impose that sentence no matter what the guidelines said. Would there be a problem there? But that would be -- if -- if ""shall"" is taken literally, there would still -- that -- that would still be subject to reversal, wouldn't it? If the plain error -- Would you draw a distinction between guidelines errors and other sentencing errors? And what would be the ground for that? Suppose there was a question about whether a defendant was properly treated as a recidivist. No, I'm talking about a non-guidelines issue, a statutory issue where there's a heavier sentence imposed based on prior criminal conduct. ",i mean if we say that an error be plain if it create a risk that the defendant will serve a long sentence than the defendant would have otherwise serve i do not know what be leave of the plain error rule in criminal case you you seem to be equate you seem to your argument seem to be that an error be plain unless it be harmless unless it be not harmless be not that right well what be leave of it in this context i mean you cite three example in your brief one be when the defendant have waive an objection to the guideline to the sentence in in a plea agreement the other be when the defendant have already complete the sentence in which case i think the case would be would be moot there would be no opportunity to get relief in a direct appeal and the other be when the the defendant be serve a concurrently run sentence do you have others okay so if there be any chance that the guideline error affect the sentence then the error be plain that be your argument okay now if we we be to apply that in other context what would be leave of the plain error rule in criminal case okay error evidence be erroneously admit at trial it be hear it be hearsay and it be it be inadmissible hearsay it be admit so there be an error but the review court say that the the harmless error standard for non constitutional error be meet but there be a chance that it have an effect on the on conviction so why would not that be a plain error but you be change the standard you be change the harmless error standard when you say that be not you well my inquiry be what be the difference between the plain error rule and the harmless error rule as you understand them and you just tell me as i what i think you just tell me be that the court would have to say it be uncontroverted that this have no effect otherwise it would be plain error yeah well that ought to cut in the opposite direction should not it the defendant have the burden under plain error right so it should be hard there i i still do not i just do not understand what be leave of the plain error rule there do not seem to be very much left if the only question be be there any chance that it cause the defendant to serve a long sentence than the defendant would have otherwise serve well if that be the correct formulation then why why be a sentence guideline error more serious than any other type of error more serious than a constitutional error more serious than a violation of a statutory command here we be not even talk about something that be mandatory these guideline exist in some kind of a middle universe that i i do not understand but that be another that be another question why why be this different well that shall be part of the mandatory regime i think that be declare unconstitutional in booker i mean suppose a district judge say all right you know there be a dispute about which what the guideline range be and one of the guideline that be possible here have a range that include the sentence of month and i have consider the statutory factor that i be suppose to consider in identify a just and appropriate sentence and i think month hit it right on the the head and that be the sentence that I be go to impose and i would impose that sentence no matter what the guideline say would there be a problem there but that would be if if shall be take literally there would still that that would still be subject to reversal would not it if the plain error would you draw a distinction between guideline error and other sentence error and what would be the ground for that suppose there be a question about whether a defendant be properly treat as a recidivist no I be talk about a non guideline issue a statutory issue where there be a heavy sentence impose base on prior criminal conduct ,276.95,Roberts Court,"Feb 21, 2018",Florencio Rosales-Mireles,United States of America,16-9493,"Sep 28, 2017","Jun 18, 2018",112,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

So if we hold that corporations can be sued under the -- under the Alien Tort Statute, we have a fair idea that there are going to -- there are going to be cases like this one and like Kiobel that do raise foreign relations concerns. Now, there are some that you can hypothesize on the other side, but are they at all comparable? Where denying a forum in the United States for a case against a corporation is -- will -- will have equally serious foreign policy consequences. If it's a U.S. corporation, won't there be other grounds on which the suit can be brought? What if you have a foreign -- if you have a foreign plaintiff suing an American corporation, that could be brought in federal court, could it not? I mean, let's -- No, I'm sorry. Let's go back to 1789 and think of concrete examples. So we know the example of the French, a French citizen assaults a French diplomat in Philadelphia. There -- there could be foreign policy repercussions for the United States if the federal courts didn't provide a forum for that suit. That's said to be the thinking behind the ATS. So suppose the French diplomat is assaulted by a British subject on a ship coming to the United States but still in international waters at the time of the -- of the assault. Now, would -- would the First Congress have wanted that to be heard in federal court where you have -- it would put us in exactly the situation between these two superpowers that we wanted to avoid? You've -- you've -- You have referred to the extraterritoriality doctrine as one that would limit the application of the ATS in cases that have foreign relations problems. But I don't know how much limitation that's going to impose if -- if it is -- if the presumption against extraterritoriality is satisfied whenever a foreign financial transaction is cleared through New York. So if we -- If we follow your recommendation and we remand this to the Second Circuit, and the Second Circuit holds, as it may very well in light of its precedents, that there is no extraterritoriality problem here, then what happens? Then there has to be a trial before the -- the issue can be brought here again? Yes. At what point? Now, Mr. Clement -- -- in the -- in the slavery hypothetical, wouldn't that be a felony under federal law?

That's option A. Option B is a congressional scheme that deals with all of these problems. If those are the only two options, which is preferable? Well, as things stand now, it seems that both the states and Internet retailers have an incentive to ask for a congressional solution to this problem. So the Internet retailers will have to deal with statutes like the Colorado reporting statute and with aggressive moves by the states to try to bring taxation within Quill in some way. And the states, obviously, have an incentive to require retail -- Internet retailers to collect the tax. So there are incentives on both sides. But if Quill is overruled, what incentives do the states have to ask for any kind of congressional legislation? But the South Dakota law is obviously a test case. You know, it was -- it was devised to present the most reasonable incarnation of this scheme.

In -- in the latter case, would that fall within the collateral-order doctrine? Well, I mean, insofar as there -- there are two possibilities for your claim. One is that it has some effect on the criminal case. And if that's the claim, then that does not fall within the collateral -order doctrine because that could be reviewed after a conviction. But if the claim is, irrespective of any effect on the criminal case, this is a violation of my constitutional rights because it violates a -- a liberty interest, a dignitary interest, then explain to me what is the difference between those two situations.

How can that be satisfaction of attorney's fees, if it's a nominal amount? But that's the -- that's the word that's used in the statute. Yeah, but you could say that the fee -- that the award has to satisfy the attorney's fees up to the cap. There wouldn't be anything odd about that. It just seems that -- you don't think that that's an odd use of the term ""satisfy""? I mean, suppose -- -- suppose a teacher said to the parent: Your -- your child can't -- can't function at school because the child is hungry. Would you give the child a portion of food for breakfast to satisfy the child's hunger? You wouldn't say, well, you know, if I give the child a tiny crumb, that would satisfy the -- the hunger.

But what if the award of attorney's fees is, let's say, 20 percent? How does that tell the court who pays the 20 percent? And that's the -- and that's the point.

Yeah, it might -- it might not be. But when -- when I was on the Third Circuit, my office was in Newark, but the headquarters of the court was in Philadelphia. And I used to get mail that was addressed to me, U.S. Court of Appeals, Market Street, Philadelphia. When this statute was enacted, do you think Congress thought that sending something Return Receipt Requested to Khartoum, for example, was -- was a simple thing? It would be like sending something Return Receipt Requested to, I don't know where, someplace in the United States? But I'm just asking about the practicalities of this. So I assume it would be this is before the era of FedEx and -- and all that, so did -- was there a simple way to do this with the U.S. Postal Service?

Would it apply to the Number 2 person in the embassy, the Number 3 person in the embassy? They all have a direct line of communication.

2018,United States v. Stitt,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, at least with respect -- Yeah. I mean, you're not exactly on a winning streak here in ACCA cases. (Laughter.) You might have gotten a hint that a majority of the Court really hates ACCA and is picking it apart bit by bit by bit. And at least with respect to the enumerated offenses like burglary, why not depart from this categorical approach and look at what actually happened in the particular case to the extent that you can determine it? If you can't determine that it -- it falls within generic burglary, fine. But, in a lot of cases, you're going to be able to figure that out very quickly. Otherwise, you're going to be at the mercy of these hypothetical -- these marginal, hypothetical cases that the -- the members of the Court and their law clerks can think of. So the car that is -- you know, has a mattress in the back and -- and, you know, things like that. Why not look at what actually happened in the real world, as opposed to these -- these hypotheticals? Yeah, the Court said that, but the Court isn't always right. Sometimes when we make a mess -- (Laughter.) -- which we have done in this -- in my humble opinion, in this area, we have made one royal mess. Maybe we ought to go back and correct our own mess. But there are a lot of -- there are a lot of vacation homes that are occupied for only a short period of time and a -- somebody contemplating a burglary can look at them and determine pretty easily that place is not occupied at the -- at the present time. But what about, say you have a house, and then next to it you have a self-propelled vehicle that is designed or adapted for the overnight accommodation of persons and is actually occupied at the time of the initial entry by the defendant. Is there any reason why the -- the burglary of the house should be treated differently from the burglary of this vehicle? Isn't the risk exactly the same? Well, why don't you have to win that? That's the Arkansas statute. What I read you is exactly what the Arkansas statute says. I'm sorry, the Tennessee statute. Right. No, no. I'm just saying, this is the contrast, why would -- why is one you would concede burglary and the other -- and the other is not? I don't see any possible reason why the law should treat those two situations differently. But we're talking about a state statute that could well be interpreted in lots of different ways by the state courts. You want us to provide a -- a definitive interpretation of the Arkansas statute here? But if you were representing a defendant before the Arkansas Supreme Court and the person had been convicted under this statute, a person lived in the car but every morning cleaned up the car so there was no way anybody could tell that anybody had been living there, wouldn't -- would you rule out the possibility of arguing to the Arkansas Supreme Court that there might -- that maybe there should be some additional requirements read into this provision?

2018,"Knick v. Township of Scott, Pennsylvania",112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Let me see if I understand your claim, because a little -- some of the questions and the discussion up to this point is a bit confusing to me. I thought your claim was that there is a violation of the takings clause and you can, therefore, bring a suit under 1983 when the state does something that constitutes a taking but at the same time says we're not paying you anything for this. Now it's not a question of when they would have to pay once they've admitted that there's a taking, but when they do something that constitutes a taking, and they say, no, this isn't a taking at all, and, therefore, you're getting zero, which I understand to be your claim here, then you can go directly to federal court and bring an action under 1983. And to require you to go to state court before you do that is essentially to require you to exhaust state remedies before you can bring a 1983 claim, which is never required under 1983. I thought that that was your argument. And the township has -- -- the township has imposed these restrictions on the property and it hasn't said that it will pay anything for it. Of course, it hasn't said that if you sue us in state court and you win in an inverse -- inverse condemnation proceeding which we will resist, we will refuse to pay the judgment of the state court. It hasn't said that. But it has -- it certainly has not said we admit that this is a taking and we owe you money, and there -- and you have to go to state court to determine how much money we owe. Am I right on that? Does the township owe -- -- does the township owe Ms. Knick any money, any compensation? You can't -- well, have you made any -- you don't know whether you owe her any money? Are you going to go back to your office and -- and think about that, and then send her a letter saying whether you owe her any money? If she does absolutely nothing, what will you do? You can't tell me whether you owe her any money? You are the state. You represent the township. The township is part of the state. So what is before us here is the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Does the township owe her any money? Yes or no? I don't see how you cannot have an answer to that question. All right. If she files an inverse condemnation proceeding, are you going to -- are you going to confess that you owe her money, at the outset? What will your position be? What will your position be? Yes, what will the position of the township be? Therefore, if you have taken her property, you have taken her property and you have denied her compensation. Why is that not a violation of the takings clause? It is a taking without compensation. Well, that's fine. That's a merits issue. That can be decided in a 1983 action. Are there -- are there any reliance interests at issue here? That's an important consideration under stare decisis. In what way are states and their subdivisions in a different position today than they were on the eve of the decision in Williamson County? So what have they done -- what have they done in reliance on their understanding that they can't be required to go directly to federal court in a case like this? What -- so what would they have done differently if that rule had never been adopted? Yeah. What would they have done differently? What would they have done differently as a result of Williamson County that cannot be easily undone? No, I'm talking about reliance. Usually, in a stare -- when -- when stare decisis is at issue, the party invoking stare decisis will say: Well, you know, this has been on the books for a long time, and -- and we've done all sorts of things or the society has done all sorts of things, and it would be a great burden to undo, very upsetting to undo all of that. That's what I was getting at. But you've addressed the reliance part. What -- what other factors under stare decisis weigh strongly in favor of retaining Williamson County in your judgment? Well, if we overruled it, would that undermine other decisions of ours? ",let me see if i understand your claim because a little some of the question and the discussion up to this point be a bit confuse to me i think your claim be that there be a violation of the taking clause and you can therefore bring a suit under when the state do something that constitute a taking but at the same time say we be not pay you anything for this now it be not a question of when they would have to pay once they have admit that there be a taking but when they do something that constitute a taking and they say no this be not a taking at all and therefore you be get zero which i understand to be your claim here then you can go directly to federal court and bring an action under and to require you to go to state court before you do that be essentially to require you to exhaust state remedy before you can bring a claim which be never require under i think that that be your argument and the township have the township have impose these restriction on the property and it have not say that it will pay anything for it of course it have not say that if you sue us in state court and you win in an inverse inverse condemnation proceed which we will resist we will refuse to pay the judgment of the state court it have not say that but it have it certainly have not say we admit that this be a take and we owe you money and there and you have to go to state court to determine how much money we owe be i right on that do the township owe do the township owe ms knick any money any compensation you can not well have you make any you do not know whether you owe her any money be you go to go back to your office and and think about that and then send her a letter say whether you owe her any money if she do absolutely nothing what will you do you can not tell me whether you owe her any money you be the state you represent the township the township be part of the state so what be before us here be the commonwealth of pennsylvania do the township owe her any money yes or no i do not see how you can not have an answer to that question all right if she file an inverse condemnation proceeding be you go to be you go to confess that you owe her money at the outset what will your position be what will your position be yes what will the position of the township be therefore if you have take her property you have take her property and you have deny her compensation why be that not a violation of the taking clause it be a take without compensation well that be fine that be a merits issue that can be decide in a action be there be there any reliance interest at issue here that be an important consideration under stare decisis in what way be state and their subdivision in a different position today than they we be on the eve of the decision in williamson county so what have they do what have they do in reliance on their understanding that they can not be require to go directly to federal court in a case like this what so what would they have do differently if that rule have never be adopt yeah what would they have do differently what would they have do differently as a result of williamson county that can not be easily undone no I be talk about reliance usually in a stare when when stare decisis be at issue the party invoke stare decisis will say well you know this have be on the book for a long time and and we have do all sort of thing or the society have do all sort of thing and it would be a great burden to undo very upset to undo all of that that be what i be get at but you have address the reliance part what what other factor under stare decisis weigh strongly in favor of retain williamson county in your judgment well if we overrule it would that undermine other decision of ours ,250.0,Case pending,"Oct 3, 2018",Rose Mary Knick,"Township of Scott, Pennsylvania",17-647,"Mar 5, 2018",,112,1.0,1.0,0.0,1

I think -- and maybe that's right, but I -- I do think your argument depends on that. And I wonder how that is consistent with the way Flores-Ortega analyzed the question of whether the attorney was deficient in that situation. If there is such a right, then why wouldn't the attorney have the right to -- have the obligation to consult with the -- with the client and to tell the client that the client has that right? But, instead, it went through a very complicated fact-bound inquiry into whether what the attorney did or called for such an inquiry into whether what the attorney did was deficient. I think we have to -- -- understand the nature of the right that you're asserting, if I could just come back to the Chief Justice's question and perhaps embellish it a little. So you have the -- you have a defendant who is an expert on plea bargains and plea waivers and knows everything about it. This is a highly intelligent, educated person, and signs a plea -- a plea agreement waiving Issue A and then, as soon as the defendant is sentenced, says to his attorney: I want to appeal Issue A. And -- and I think your answer has to be that the -- that that is the right of the defendant and the obligation of the attorney to carry out that -- the client's wishes. Am I right? That has to be your position. But what are the practical differences between the consequences of the position you're advocating and what would happen if you were to lose this case? If you win in the situation where the attorney thinks there's no non-frivolous claim to be raised on appeal, after the plea waiver, the attorney, you say, will file an Anders brief, right? Okay. That's -- that's one side of it. And then the other side, if you were to lose, then the defendant would not be entirely precluded from trying to take an appeal with respect to issues that the defendant thinks are outside of the plea waiver, the defendant could bring a collateral proceeding and argue that his attorney was ineffective for failing to take an appeal based on a plea waiver that didn't cover the issue. And the only difference I can see depends on state law; namely, whether -- and maybe there are other differences and you'll tell me if I'm overlooking something -- whether an attorney will be appointed for the defendant in the post-conviction proceeding and whether there will be a more stringent standard of review. But if state law didn't -- if state law provided an attorney and didn't provide a more stringent standard of review, what is the practical difference? Well, I guess what I left out is that the issue -- the claim in the -- in the collateral proceeding would be ineffective assistance of counsel. Is there any practical difference in -- differences between the consequences of taking a hopeless appeal when there is no plea -- when there is no appeal waiver and the consequences of taking a hopeless appeal that is covered by a plea waiver? I think Mr. -- I think Mr. Ali said that -- that Garza would like to raise the issue of the voluntariness of his agreement. Is that still an open question? Well, has there been a decision on that issue by any state court? Do you think we can get anything out of the question whether the defendant has a legal right to file some thing there? Isn't it the case that, under statutes and under rules, defendants have the right to do all sorts of things during a criminal proceeding, but for almost all of those, the decision is made by the attorney? ",well i think that yeah and if it be determined i i think this i think this be the thrust of justice ginsburg s question if it be ultimately determine that the appeal be in violation of the appeal waiver then the plea bargain have be break by the defendant and and it may be void but i think your argument do ultimately depend on the proposition that the defendant have this categorical right base on autonomy to insist on an appeal and have an attorney perfect the appeal file the notice of appeal even if there be zero chance that the appeal will be find not to have be waive i think and maybe that be right but i i do think your argument depend on that and i wonder how that be consistent with the way flores ortega analyze the question of whether the attorney be deficient in that situation if there be such a right then why would not the attorney have the right to have the obligation to consult with the with the client and to tell the client that the client have that right but instead it go through a very complicate fact bound inquiry into whether what the attorney do or call for such an inquiry into whether what the attorney do be deficient i think we have to understand the nature of the right that you be assert if i could just come back to the chief justice s question and perhaps embellish it a little so you have the you have a defendant who be an expert on plea bargain and plea waiver and know everything about it this be a highly intelligent educate person and sign a plea a plea agreement waive issue a and then as soon as the defendant be sentence say to his attorney i want to appeal issue a and and i think your answer have to be that the that that be the right of the defendant and the obligation of the attorney to carry out that the client s wish be i right that have to be your position but what be the practical difference between the consequence of the position you be advocate and what would happen if you we be to lose this case if you win in the situation where the attorney think there be no non frivolous claim to be raise on appeal after the plea waiver the attorney you say will file an anders brief right okay that be that be one side of it and then the other side if you we be to lose then the defendant would not be entirely preclude from try to take an appeal with respect to issue that the defendant think be outside of the plea waiver the defendant could bring a collateral proceeding and argue that his attorney be ineffective for fail to take an appeal base on a plea waiver that do not cover the issue and the only difference i can see depends on state law namely whether and maybe there be other difference and you will tell me if I be overlook something whether an attorney will be appoint for the defendant in the post conviction proceeding and whether there will be a more stringent standard of review but if state law do not if state law provide an attorney and do not provide a more stringent standard of review what be the practical difference well i guess what i leave out be that the issue the claim in the in the collateral proceeding would be ineffective assistance of counsel be there any practical difference in difference between the consequence of take a hopeless appeal when there be no plea when there be no appeal waiver and the consequence of take a hopeless appeal that be cover by a plea waiver i think mr i think mr ali say that that garza would like to raise the issue of the voluntariness of his agreement be that still an open question well have there be a decision on that issue by any state court do you think we can get anything out of the question whether the defendant have a legal right to file some thing there be not it the case that under statute and under rule defendant have the right to do all sort of thing during a criminal proceeding but for almost all of those the decision be make by the attorney ,259.68,Roberts Court,"Oct 30, 2018","Gilberto Garza, Jr.",Idaho,17-1026,"Jun 18, 2018","Feb 27, 2019",112,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

If a person -- if -- if a person simply is without memory of his commission of the capital offense, does that in itself render that person incompetent to be executed? No, I think that's a -- a question that calls for a yes or no answer. If the only thing that is lacking is memory of the commission of the capital offense, does that in itself render the person incompetent to be executed? No, I don't understand -- I don't understand your answer. I don't -- I can't think of a situation in which a person would lack memory of the commission of the offense without that being based on a mental condition. By definition, it's a mental condition. Well, Mr. Madison obviously has serious problems, serious physical problems and mental problems, but I'm quite confused by the arguments that you're making. Isn't it the case that in his order of April 29 Judge Smith found that Madison failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he does not rationally understand the punishment he is about to suffer and why he is about to suffer it? Did he not make that finding and is that not supported by the testimony of the defense expert, Dr. Goff? That's a direct quote from his order. Well, I don't think you're accurately representing what Dr. Goff testified, but I don't want to argue about what the record shows and doesn't -- and doesn't show. Yes, he did not -- he did not remember the crime. He did not remember the victim. But he said he understands the sentence, specifically the meaning of the death sentence. He understands the meaning of execution, and many details involved. He is able to understand the nature of the proceedings. He thinks he understands that what the state is seeking is retribution. He feels his conviction was unjust. He never went around killing folks. But this order was the order that came before us when this case was before us the last time, is that not right? And that's what you're now contesting. You're contesting the order that was already before us that you chose not to contest on appeal in the -- in the Alabama courts. And the only thing that's happened since then, and what you've cited, are the -- the events concerning Kirkwood. Is that right? When you back -- when you went back to the trial court, you emphasized the events concerning Kirkwood. What is his situation now? Did the grand jury refuse to return a true bill for him? He's still under investigation by whom? Well, that was the question we -- the principal question that we granted, but, apparently, it's fallen out of the case.

2018,Obduskey v. McCarthy & Holthus LLP,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","I think you have a -- you have a pretty good argument if we look just at 15 U.S.C. 1692a(6), which talks about regularly collects or attempts to collect, directly or indirectly, debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due to another. At least you've got a -- you've got a reasonable argument under that provision. But the two provisions that seem to me to create a lot of problems for your position are 15 U.S.A. -- 15 U.S.C. 1692a(6), which creates a special definition of ""debt collector"" for a purpose that's not relevant here, and that refers to any business the principal purpose of which is the enforcement of security interests. So, if a -- a business whose principal purpose is the enforcement of security interests fell within the prior definition, the all-purpose definition, there wouldn't be a reason for -- for that provision. So I -- I think you've got a tough time explaining that away. And your -- your answer is that refers to repo activities. But then there's another provision that talks about what looks like repo activities in a lot more specific language, 1692f(6), which talks about dispossession and disablement. So what's your answer to that? Right. Yeah, but somebody who's engaging in a non-judicial foreclosure is enforcing a security interest, and if they didn't -- so they appear to fall within that provision. And if Congress didn't want them to fall within that provision and only wanted to capture the repo guys, why wouldn't it use the more specific language that it used elsewhere when it was referring to the repo guys? Well, let me ask you this about the repo situation: Suppose that the repo guy is out there getting into a car, and the owner of the car sees him out the window and runs out with a gun and says, what are you doing? And the repo guy says, well, you didn't pay, you're in default on your payments, so I'm taking your car. Is he a -- is he a debt collector because he's now told the -- the -- the car owner that -- about the debt? So what is the difference between that situation and the non-judicial foreclosure situation where the -- the homeowner is simply notified that the -- the house that -- the mortgage is being foreclosed? What is the difference?

2018,"Home Depot U.S.A., Inc. v. Jackson",112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","The argument is that what Mr. Jackson filed against you was not a civil action filed under Rule 23. And if that is the case, then I don't know what rules would govern this claim that Jackson filed against you. Is this some kind of class action that is -- is this some sort of suit that is sort of like a class action, but it's not under Rule 23, so none of the requirements of Rule 23 would apply? I mean, the argument is -- it's a clever argument, comes out of I don't know where -- the argument is, no, it's not, he didn't file a class action against you under Rule 23, but, when the court adjudicates this action, it should apply the rules that -- it should apply the Rule 23 rules. But what you're arguing is not based on the language, not based on the term ""original jurisdiction"" in 1441. It's based on the well-pleaded complaint rule. Am I right on that? Yeah. That's the -- No, go ahead. Yeah, but you're saying -- you're -- you're -- there would be original jurisdiction if this claim were in the case at the beginning. You would agree with that. So you're saying it's original jurisdiction at the beginning, right? That's what -- So you're reading that into the text, and you make -- No. Well, original -- You agree with Justice -- -- with Justice Kagan's answer to my question? (Laughter.) Well, this is -- this is -- this case is very, very complicated. And let's go -- let's go back step by step. Put aside this question of original jurisdiction. If we look at the text, we have a reference to the defendant or the defendants. So Home Depot would qualify there, would it not? Okay. You're reading things into it. But, in the ordinary sense of the term, are they -- are they not defendants? They are some kind of defendants. Yeah. Okay. And where does this come from? All right? So we start out with a term that's big enough to encompass them. Now we have the limitation. Where does this limitation come from? It comes from Shamrock Oil, does it not? That's the -- the origin of it. Right. And so Shamrock Oil basically says, look, you -- you started out as the plaintiff, and you chose the state forum. And now that you have been sued with a counterclaim, you can't -- you know, you -- you chose the state court and you're stuck in state court, so you can't remove it to federal court. I -- I don't see that Shamrock Oil goes any further than that. Right. They chose state court. Yeah, but Citibank is gone. And, you know, Citibank brought a little case on credit card debt in state court. And then suddenly this thing gets transmogrified into a class action that you say, well, this one has to stay in state court despite CAFA. If it had been brought originally in this forum, it would be removable under CAFA. That's what Congress wanted. And somebody came up with this idea of using this sort of proceeding as a way of getting around CAFA. And there's a law review article that actually says, after CAFA, well, look, we found a way to get around CAFA so that we can keep these things in state court. Is that not correct? Since when are law review -- Since when are law review articles peer reviewed? Who are they -- who are they reviewed by? (Laughter.) They should be -- maybe they should be peer reviewed. Well, perhaps it's not possible to decide this case in a way that doesn't go as -- doesn't effectively decide all these other different situations that you've -- you've posited, but if we look just at what happened here -- and this -- and this involves not -- I mean, this implicates not just the original removal statute but CAFA, is there any good reason why a claim like this, if you accept CAFA, why this should be -- should not be removable to -- to federal court? When you think CAFA said, well, if -- if a claim like this is filed originally in federal -- in state court, it can be removed, but if it comes into the state court in this strange sort of back-door way, then it has to stay in state court. You really think that that's a possible decision Congress would make? Well, I mean, that's -- I mean, that's based on the -- -- the idea that they -- they -- they were aware of these district court cases. They're -- they're almost all district court cases. And they said, well, okay, we -- we want to accept that. I mean, that's -- Well, they could have been -- they surely -- they could have been more specific in a way that favors Home Depot. They also could have been more specific in a way that favors you, right? It's pretty hard to argue that when they said any defendants, they said we're going to say any defendants because we don't want to include the kind of defendant that Home Depot is.

2018,Nieves v. Bartlett,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","So this -- this is a difficult issue, which we've heard a couple of times now already, because there are a range of cases. And at one end, I think, there is a case that's sort of like this case, where you've got the disorderly person situation. A police officer arrives at the scene where two people or a -- two groups of people are shouting at each other, and in the course of the -- while the officer is present, one of them says something insulting to the officer, and that person ends up getting arrested. And so you have the question of whether that's -- that has to go -- that may have to go to trial as to the -- the officer's motivation, was it because the kind of fuzzy standard of disorderly conduct was met or was it because the person -- what the person said about the officer. So you've got that category maybe at one end. At the other end, you have the case like a journalist has written something critical of the police department and then a couple of days later or a week later, two day -- two weeks later, whatever, some period of time, is arrested -- is given a citation for driving 30 miles an hour in a 20-mile -- 25-mile-an-hour zone. So your rule -- what you ask us to do would create a problem in the latter situation. What the other side asks us to do may create a problem in the disorderly person situation. So do you have any way of solving this, other than asking us to decide which -- which rule -- which of these unattractive rules we should adopt? Am I correct that the Ninth Circuit -- well, I don't want to take up your rebuttal time, but just very quickly, the Ninth Circuit has developed its own special qualified immunity rule for use in this particular situation? Summary -- it's own summary judgment rule. And it doesn't seem to be really consistent with our summary judgment -- -- cases. No, is that correct or not? Whenever there's -- whenever there's probable cause and there's a First Amendment allegation, what's really being complained about is discriminatory arrest. So what if we were to say that a party making such a claim has to plead and ultimately prove that there is a comparator who engaged in similar conduct or people who were similar and they engaged in the same conduct, but they were not arrested? Yeah. Well, if there's no comparator, then the plaintiff is out of luck. I'm interested in the third point you made, I think it was, or maybe it was the second one, that there are other mechanisms for screening out the meritless cases. Is that right? Was that Point 2 or 3 there? Okay. On the last point, I assume that you believe that in this case your client's claim would survive qualified immunity and summary judgment, am I -- that it -- it survives -- it -- it satisfies Twombly and it would survive qualified immunity? And that -- doesn't that refute your claim that -- that those doctrines would rule out the rather trivial cases? Did your client say anything that was of social importance? This is just -- he's not protesting some social issue or making some important point. He's involved in a personal dispute with a police officer. Well, yeah, let's assume that case where it's all videotapes, and it's really high-quality video and you've got sound too, and what it shows is that the individual who's ultimately arrested is arguing with other people, and they're calling each other names and they're waving their arms, and the police officer arrives, and in the course of this encounter, the person who's arrested says some insulting things to the police officer, and then some period of time goes by, maybe it's 30 seconds, maybe it's two minutes, maybe it's three minutes, the person is arrested. And the arrestee says: The only reason why I was arrested was because I exercised my free speech right to criticize the police officer. That is a question of subjective intent, and I don't see how it is going to be weeded out at the pleadings stage or on qualified immunity or even on summary judgment. You explain to me how that could be weeded out, or -- -- maybe you think it shouldn't be. Okay. How? But what if -- This is involving safety. The cases involving safety issues are not the ones that are troubling. They're the cases involving lesser crimes, like the one that your client was charged with. And there are many -- there are areas of the law where intent has to be proven, and in those areas of the law, direct evidence of an unlawful intent is often not present. But is it not the case -- you can answer this as a trial lawyer -- is it not the case that intent is very often inferred based on a sequence of events? So someone exercises the First Amendment right to say something and, shortly after that, there's retaliation against -- some adverse action is taken against that person. Can you not infer intent based just on that sequence of events? Why? What approach have we taken in prior cases involving the necessary elements of proof in the 1983 action? Have we said that we will import the common law rule as of 1871 entirely, or has that been a consideration in our decision-making? So do you think we should do that here? Or I thought you were arguing a minute ago that we should just adopt whatever the common law rule was. ",so this this be a difficult issue which we have hear a couple of time now already because there be a range of case and at one end i think there be a case that be sort of like this case where you have get the disorderly person situation a police officer arrive at the scene where two people or a two group of people be shout at each other and in the course of the while the officer be present one of them say something insult to the officer and that person end up get arrest and so you have the question of whether that be that have to go that may have to go to trial as to the the officer s motivation be it because the kind of fuzzy standard of disorderly conduct be meet or be it because the person what the person say about the officer so you have get that category maybe at one end at the other end you have the case like a journalist have write something critical of the police department and then a couple of day later or a week later two day two week later whatever some period of time be arrest be give a citation for drive mile an hour in a mile mile an hour zone so your rule what you ask us to do would create a problem in the latter situation what the other side ask us to do may create a problem in the disorderly person situation so do you have any way of solve this other than ask us to decide which which rule which of these unattractive rule we should adopt be i correct that the ninth circuit well i do not want to take up your rebuttal time but just very quickly the ninth circuit have develop its own special qualify immunity rule for use in this particular situation summary it be own summary judgment rule and it do not seem to be really consistent with our summary judgment case no be that correct or not whenever there be whenever there have probable because and there be a first amendment allegation what be really be complain about be discriminatory arrest so what if we we be to say that a party making such a claim have to plead and ultimately prove that there be a comparator who engage in similar conduct or people who we be similar and they engage in the same conduct but they we be not arrest yeah well if there be no comparator then the plaintiff be out of luck I be interested in the third point you make i think it be or maybe it be the second one that there be other mechanism for screen out the meritless case be that right be that point or there okay on the last point i assume that you believe that in this case your client s claim would survive qualified immunity and summary judgment be i that it it survive it it satisfy twombly and it would survive qualified immunity and that do not that refute your claim that that those doctrine would rule out the rather trivial case do your client say anything that be of social importance this be just he be not protest some social issue or make some important point he be involve in a personal dispute with a police officer well yeah let us assume that case where it be all videotape and it be really high quality video and you have get sound too and what it show be that the individual who be ultimately arrest be argue with other people and they be call each other name and they be wave their arm and the police officer arrive and in the course of this encounter the person who be arrest say some insulting thing to the police officer and then some period of time go by maybe it be second maybe it be two minute maybe it be three minute the person be arrest and the arrestee say the only reason why i be arrest be because i exercise my free speech right to criticize the police officer that be a question of subjective intent and i do not see how it be go to be weed out at the pleading stage or on qualified immunity or even on summary judgment you explain to me how that could be weed out or maybe you think it should not be okay how but what if this be involve safety the case involve safety issue be not the one that be trouble they be the case involve less crime like the one that your client be charge with and there be many there be area of the law where intent have to be prove and in those area of the law direct evidence of an unlawful intent be often not present but be it not the case you can answer this as a trial lawyer be it not the case that intent be very often infer base on a sequence of event so someone exercise the first amendment right to say something and shortly after that there be retaliation against some adverse action be take against that person can you not infer intent base just on that sequence of event why what approach have we take in prior case involve the necessary element of proof in the action have we say that we will import the common law rule as of entirely or have that be a consideration in our decision making so do you think we should do that here or i think you we be argue a minute ago that we should just adopt whatever the common law rule be ,350.52,Case pending,"Nov 26, 2018","Luis A.

If we just -- if -- if the court just applies Burr, how is -- how is the court supposed to proceed in determining whether there is immunity? Look at the -- make a case-by-case determination whether the particular claim in that case falls within the -- the two categories set out in Burr, so is it consistent with the statutory and constitutional scheme, or, more to the point, does -- is it necessary to have immunity to avoid grave interference with the performance of a governmental function? Okay. You think this is -- this is to be done a case-by-case basis or categorical basis? Here's what bothers me about this case, and I'll ask the same question, if I have a chance, to the Assistant to the Solicitor General. The -- the TVA does some things that are purely governmental and it does some things that are pretty much purely commercial. It's a hybrid entity. As to the -- as to its commercial activities, it's hard to see why a -- a business should be exempt from tort liability for every discretionary business decision that the business makes. But, as to its governmental activities, it's kind of hard to see why the regime should be different from the regime under the Federal Tort Claims Act. Now, under Burr, the Court is supposed to ask, you say, whether it interferes with a governmental function, but I'm not quite sure what is the governmental function when you're talking about a hybrid entity like that. Does it mean something that only the government can do? Part -- Go ahead. You said -- So, basically, you're -- Go ahead. Your argument is that every discretionary decision that the TVA makes in doing exactly the sort of thing that is done by a private power company is covered by sovereign immunity? Governmental doesn't -- is not distinguished from commercial? So, if TVA does -- engages in an act of negligence in doing exactly the same thing that is done every day by, let's say, PEPCO, the TVA is completely immune? And by ""this category of claim,"" what do you mean? All right. Suppose I think -- this is a similar question, maybe a little bit different -- suppose that I think what we should do is apply Burr, and suppose I think that governmental does not mean commercial, that there's a distinction between the two.

2018,United States v. Haymond,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Mr. Feigin, I -- I'd like to understand what question we are deciding here. What Justice Sotomayor is raising is really a revolutionary argument that would bring down the entire system of supervised release, which has been the law for, what, 35 years? Is that the issue that is before us in this case? Is Mr. -- is Mr. Lunn making that argument? Well, that -- that's an interesting -- it's an interesting question and I -- I think it's a hard one, and it's not briefed, and I -- I just don't -- I'm having enough trouble with what I understood to be the issue presented by this case without deciding whether we should overrule an enormous amount of precedent and wipe out probation and parole or decide this novel question which isn't presented here. It -- it -- Mr. -- Mr. Haymond has to make an -- an as-applied challenge to the part of the statute to which he objects, and he -- his -- he is not in this situation, where he is required -- he's required to serve a term of imprisonment that exceeds the statutory maximum. Well, can I ask you about Alleyne? What Alleyne held is that the touchstone for determining whether a fact must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt is whether the fact constitutes an element of the charged offense. So you're saying that all of the conditions of supervised release are elements of the charged offense? Right. So all of the -- all of the conditions in Mr. Haymond's supervised release were elements of the offense? But what -- what does the Sixth Amendment protect? Does it protect the rights of -- the rights of -- of people to have a jury of their peers, or does it protect the rights of judges to exercise discretion? I mean, I thought the right -- the reason for the jury trial right was fundamentally distrust of judges. They didn't want these things to be in the hands of judges, who had historically been appointed by the crown and were thought to be beholden to the crown. They wanted it to be in the hands of ordinary citizens. So how does that get turned into a regime that protects the prerogatives of a judge to decide what the term of imprisonment should be? Well, you're saying that there's a problem with the mandatory five, because it ought to be up to the discretion of the district judge. And that's based on the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. Okay. So what you're -- what you want is the judge to have the discretion to impose something less than five? How do you connect that with the right to a jury trial? Do you have any idea how many revocation proceedings there are every year? But the total number of revocation proceedings, maybe Mr. Feigin has an idea, so we know what we're dealing with with some of these potential arguments. Are -- are you representing a client who was given life without parole?

I mean, it seems to me like a significant question, and I was underwhelmed by the reasons given in the comment to the provision of the Restatement on this question.

2018,Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. v. Albrecht,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","So what would happen if -- if the FDA had said in response -- in the complete response letter the medical evidence is insufficient and then Merck turned around within a short period of time and filed a -- a CBE relating to the same thing? What would the FDA have done? Well, is it your argument now that -- that Merck is -- Merck became liable at some point after the issuance of the complete response letter or on the day after the issuance of the complete response letter? What if -- but what if the -- the FDA had said the wording of your -- of your warning is bad because this term ""stress fracture"" is misleading, but beyond that, the data does not support any warning relating to low-energy femoral fractures? Well, what would -- Well, that's not really -- I mean, are you really serious about that argument? What would be preemptive is not the letter. What would be preemptive is what FDA would do. And that -- that's the question. The only argument relating to the safety -- the safety announcement is that it informs, it helps to tell us what FDA meant when it said no, you cannot add a warning to this label. The thing -- what Mr. -- I'm sorry. Go ahead. What Mr. Stewart cited was page 746 of the Joint Appendix, where Merck defines a stress fracture in this way: ""A stress fracture (also known as an insufficiency fracture) is defined as a partial or complete fracture occurring with either normal or increased activity but without an identifiable external traumatic event."" Now does not that encompass a -- the type of fracture that you're talking about? Well, it says ""or complete."" Yeah, well, that's fine, but this is what -- you know, in very simple terms, this is what troubles me about your argument. This is not a situation, I think, where Merck is proposing to warn about one thing and the data shows that there's a danger about something that's totally unrelated, and, therefore, the FDA may not focus on this second thing, like Justice Kagan's example of -- perhaps of ovarian cancer and ovarian cysts -- cysts. But, if the FDA sees this proposed warning and they think this -- the -- the wording here is bad, they shouldn't be talking about stress fractures, but we look at the data and we see that there is something that should be labeled differently and it should be -- there should be a warning about that, it would -- it would shock me if the -- what the FDA should do in that situation is to say: Well, you know, you got the warning wrong and so we're not going to issue it and we're going to do -- we're going to prohibit that, but we're not going to do anything more. If they understood that there was a danger of something else that is at least related to what the manufacturer was proposing to warn about, surely the public would expect them to do something. That's what troubles me -- -- about your argument. Mr. Frederick, you want us to affirm the decision of the Third Circuit? Uh-huh. And so then the issue should be decided -- the juries in these cases should decide whether the FDA would have approved this -- -- based on that Merck would have to prove to a jury by clear and convincing evidence that the FDA would not have approved an appropriate warning? I'm confused. So you want us to say there is no preemption? You want us to say that Merck wasn't entitled to summary judgment on the issue of preemption? Which of the two?

So you want us -- ",so what would happen if if the fda have say in response in the complete response letter the medical evidence be insufficient and then merck turn around within a short period of time and file a a cbe relate to the same thing what would the fda have do well be it your argument now that that merck be merck become liable at some point after the issuance of the complete response letter or on the day after the issuance of the complete response letter what if but what if the the fda have say the wording of your of your warning be bad because this term stress fracture be misleading but beyond that the data do not support any warning relate to low energy femoral fracture well what would well that be not really i mean be you really serious about that argument what would be preemptive be not the letter what would be preemptive be what fda would do and that that be the question the only argument relate to the safety the safety announcement be that it inform it help to tell us what fda meant when it say no you can not add a warning to this label the thing what mr I be sorry go ahead what mr stewart cite be page of the joint appendix where merck define a stress fracture in this way a stress fracture also know as an insufficiency fracture be define as a partial or complete fracture occur with either normal or increased activity but without an identifiable external traumatic event now do not that encompass a the type of fracture that you be talk about well it say or complete yeah well that be fine but this be what you know in very simple term this be what troubles me about your argument this be not a situation i think where merck be propose to warn about one thing and the data show that there be a danger about something that be totally unrelated and therefore the fda may not focus on this second thing like justice kagan s example of perhaps of ovarian cancer and ovarian cyst cyst but if the fda see this propose warning and they think this the the wording here be bad they should not be talk about stress fracture but we look at the data and we see that there be something that should be label differently and it should be there should be a warning about that it would it would shock me if the what the fda should do in that situation be to say well you know you get the warning wrong and so we be not go to issue it and we be go to do we be go to prohibit that but we be not go to do anything more if they understand that there be a danger of something else that be at least related to what the manufacturer be propose to warn about surely the public would expect them to do something that be what trouble me about your argument mr frederick you want us to affirm the decision of the third circuit uh huh and so then the issue should be decide the jury in these case should decide whether the fda would have approve this base on that merck would have to prove to a jury by clear and convincing evidence that the fda would not have approve an appropriate warning I be confuse so you want us to say there be no preemption you want us to say that merck be not entitle to summary judgment on the issue of preemption which of the two yeah but you want to alter the judgment of the third circuit by say that it be it be wrong in in say this should be submit to a jury that it be a factual question to be submit to a jury so you want us ,235.24,Case pending,"Jan 7, 2019",Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp.,"Doris Albrecht, et al.",17-290,"Jun 28, 2018",,112,1.0,1.0,0.0,1

So the inquiry wouldn't be what was in the minds of these particular legislators, but would a reasonable legislator -- is -- do -- enact this particular prohibition if its objective was not disagreement with the federal regulations? Before you get too deeply into that decision, which you have addressed very extensively and well in your brief, could I just ask you this: Suppose the Virginia General Assembly enacted a law that reads as follows: The General Assembly disagrees with the federal government that uranium tailings can be safely stored in Virginia and, for that reason and only that reason, we are banning the practice of uranium mining. Would that be preempted? Yeah, how would that be -- I mean, doesn't that make nonsense of 2120 -- 2021(k)? And what does that mean? Well, Virginia allows coal mining and has a fair amount of coal mining in the western part of the state. So could a court compare coal mining with uranium mining and see if there's something that if one is more disruptive to the scenery than the other or one is more dangerous to miners than the other, something like that? So you could ask whether it's plausible that this was done for some reason other than just the fact that Virginia disagrees with the NRC that the tailings can be dealt with in a safe way. Well, that may be. You could have a moratorium on mining, period. You could have a mora -- no more mining of anything in Virginia. You could have that. That's not what the legislature did here. 2021, Section (c), 2021(c)(4) says that the Commission shall retain the authority to regulate the disposal of byproduct. And then (k) says nothing. And that is -- it's that regulatory authority, I take it, which is the statutory basis of the preemption argument. And (k) says nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the authority of the state or local agencies and so forth. So how do you -- Why is it tied -- why do you -- why do you say (k) is tied solely to -- -- licensing? Well, it goes on to say the disposal of such other byproducts source or special nuclear material. But do you dispute the fact that the NRC has -- occupies the field of regulation of source material? After it leaves the ground. Yeah, but if the -- if -- if a state law indirectly, surreptitiously regulates the same thing, it would fall within the prohibited field.

2018,Nielsen v. Preap,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Mr. Tripp? Mr. Tripp? Now, Mr. Tripp, what is the definition of the class that was certified by the district court? Does it consist of -- solely of people who have been -- who were released from criminal custody many years ago? Well, that may or may not -- Well, Mr. Tripp -- -- you've been -- you've been pushed on the question whether there might be some circumstances in which an alien who would otherwise fall within the statute would have a constitutional right to a bail hearing, but I thought the question that we agreed to decide related to the -- what the Ninth Circuit saw as a requirement that the alien that -- that Homeland Security take the alien into custody immediately, and that was the class of aliens that was certified by the district court. So, if we were to reverse that determination, would that preclude a challenge by -- an individual challenge, an as-applied challenge by an alien who fell within the -- the circumstances that have been described? What do you think ""when"" -- what do you think ""when means""? Does it mean immediately? Does ""when"" mean immediately? Immediately? So as soon as the person is -- walks out of the door of the prison or the jail, if -- if ICE doesn't take the person into custody at that point, that's the end of it? What -- what does -- What does ""a reasonable degree of immediacy"" mean? I mean, let's -- I don't know how many people will be released from criminal custody today in, let's say, the State of California, but I'm sure there are dozens, probably hundreds. I don't know. A lot. How is the federal government going to be able to determine quickly, within 48 hours or any short period of time, whether those individuals would be subject to the mandatory detention requirement of this statute? California is not going to tell the federal government, look, we're releasing this person and this person is an alien, not a citizen, and this is what the person was convicted of. How are they supposed to do that? So the first part of your answer is that -- that the state -- the state governments, the municipal governments are going to provide this information to -- to the Department of Homeland Security? And is that what is happening now? Yeah, and what they enacted was a provision that says the Attorney General, now, the Secretary shall take into custody any alien who satisfies certain requirements when the alien is released. But we have to decide whether ""when the alien is released"" means, as you say, as the Ninth Circuit said, immediately, within 48 hours, within some reasonable period, or after the alien is released. In simple terms, that's the question before us, right? Yeah, I can see that -- I can see the equities when the alien has been free for a number of years. But Congress, wisely or not, thought that this class of aliens was dangerous and they should not be trusted. Bail hearings were unreliable. So you would say that this statute requires their detention as soon as they get out. Now why -- if that's the case, and it -- it obviously is, why would Congress think differently about someone who's been out for a week?

2018,Stokeling v. United States,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Do you think that -- do you think that shoving, grabbing, and pinching count as physical force under ACCA? Well, I thought under the categorical approach, you have to look at the category. So I really don't understand why you can't answer that question. Does pinching, for example, constitute physical force sufficient to -- to activate ACCA? Well, this has -- In Taylor, the Court said that the revision of ACCA to include the elements clause expanded the predicate offenses beyond just robbery and burglary. But we are told that your reading of the statute would knock out robbery offenses in 30 to 40 case -- in 30 to 40 states. What is your response to that? Does that seem -- does it seem likely that that's what Congress was intending to do? So your answer -- your answer is that they thought that robbery was going to be covered by the residual clause, is that right? I don't understand your -- Well, in how many states would common law robbery, would simple robbery, not armed robbery or an aggravated form of robbery, be knocked out by your understanding of the statute? So you think that in -- in applying the categorical approach here, it's necessary to look to the cases that are prosecuted? To -- you have to look to -- to -- beyond the statute, you have to look to prosecutorial policies and practices? But the statutory term is physical force. And in the ordinary understanding of that, force sufficient to overcome resistance would be physical force. The holding in Curtis Johnson was what Justice Kavanaugh described, battery -- the touching that is necessary for a battery is not physical force; any unwanted touching satisfies common law battery. Now, if we go beyond that, you have -- it would be necessary to quantify the degree of physical force that's required, like how many pounds per square inch. I have no idea how you do that. So what is a substantial degree of force? Well, do you think there could not be substantial force unless it actually causes pain or injury? But you think this depends on a case-by-case determination? But you -- you have to hypothesize a particular type of robber and a particular type of victim. So, you know, what is the -- what is the quintessential robber and what is the quintessential victim? As you -- you know, as you just mentioned, if you have a very strong victim and a very weak robber, an awful lot of force could be applied without a reasonable possibility of causing pain. On the other hand, in what might be the more typical situation, if you have a young, strong robber who pulls a purse out of the hands of an elderly woman or a briefcase out of the hands of an elderly man, there's a real chance that that's going to cause pain and maybe serious physical injury. So I have no idea how to imagine that the -- the typical robber and the typical victim. Who are these people? Can you describe them for me? Okay. Under your -- under the cases -- under the Florida cases, you've studied them all, what is the typical victim and what is the typical robber? Ms. -- Ms. Bryn says that her understanding of what Curtis Johnson requires would have a minimal effect on the robbery statutes of the states. Is she counting the states correctly? But isn't the standard force sufficient to overcome resistance a quantification? That's a way of quantifying how much force is necessary. So the -- the force that is required for a battery, the merest touching, is -- is not enough, but there has to be a substantial amount, a quantifiable amount, and the quantification is the amount of force necessary to overcome resistance. If you don't adopt that, then I do think you have to get to foot pounds or something like that. Well, the residual clause referred to ""capable of causing"" -- I'm sorry -- ""a serious risk of physical injury."" So how would common law robbery come within that? I'm sorry, you think that -- -- you think that common law robbery involves a serious risk of physical injury? Then how would it fall within the residual clause, which is what you just said? ",do you think that do you think that shove grabbing and pinch count as physical force under acca well i think under the categorical approach you have to look at the category so i really do not understand why you can not answer that question do pinching for example constitute physical force sufficient to to activate acca well this have in taylor the court say that the revision of acca to include the element clause expand the predicate offenses beyond just robbery and burglary but we be tell that your reading of the statute would knock out robbery offense in to case in to state what be your response to that do that seem do it seem likely that that be what congress be intend to do so your answer your answer be that they think that robbery be go to be cover by the residual clause be that right i do not understand your well in how many state would common law robbery would simple robbery not arm robbery or an aggravated form of robbery be knock out by your understanding of the statute so you think that in in apply the categorical approach here it be necessary to look to the case that be prosecute to you have to look to to beyond the statute you have to look to prosecutorial policy and practice but the statutory term be physical force and in the ordinary understanding of that force sufficient to overcome resistance would be physical force the hold in curtis johnson be what justice kavanaugh describe battery the touching that be necessary for a battery be not physical force any unwanted touching satisfies common law battery now if we go beyond that you have it would be necessary to quantify the degree of physical force that be require like how many pound per square inch i have no idea how you do that so what be a substantial degree of force well do you think there could not be substantial force unless it actually cause pain or injury but you think this depend on a case by case determination but you you have to hypothesize a particular type of robber and a particular type of victim so you know what be the what be the quintessential robber and what be the quintessential victim as you you know as you just mention if you have a very strong victim and a very weak robber an awful lot of force could be apply without a reasonable possibility of cause pain on the other hand in what might be the more typical situation if you have a young strong robber who pull a purse out of the hand of an elderly woman or a briefcase out of the hand of an elderly man there be a real chance that that be go to because pain and maybe serious physical injury so i have no idea how to imagine that the the typical robber and the typical victim who be these people can you describe them for me okay under your under the case under the florida case you have study them all what be the typical victim and what be the typical robber ms ms bryn say that her understanding of what curtis johnson require would have a minimal effect on the robbery statute of the state be she count the state correctly but be not the standard force sufficient to overcome resistance a quantification that be a way of quantify how much force be necessary so the the force that be require for a battery the mere touching be be not enough but there have to be a substantial amount a quantifiable amount and the quantification be the amount of force necessary to overcome resistance if you do not adopt that then i do think you have to get to foot pound or something like that well the residual clause refer to capable of cause I be sorry a serious risk of physical injury so how would common law robbery come within that I be sorry you think that you think that common law robbery involve a serious risk of physical injury then how would it fall within the residual clause which be what you just say ,247.72,Roberts Court,"Oct 9, 2018",Denard Stokeling,United States of America,17-5554,"Apr 2, 2018","Jan 15, 2019",112,0.0,1.0,0.0,0

So, today, let's say a group of American tourists are murdered by terrorists in a foreign country, and there is a prosecution in the foreign country for murder, the same offense in a court of competent jurisdiction there, and it's not a sham prosecution, but it's a fairly inept prosecution, lack of prosecutorial investigative resources in a poor country, and it results in an acquittal or a conviction with a very light sentence. And your position is that there could not be a prosecution here in the United States under the statute enacted by Congress to permit the prosecution of individuals who murder Americans abroad? Yeah, well -- -- could you just answer whether that's correct or not? And if it's not correct, why is it not correct? But I really don't think you're -- I mean, I don't think this is in -- a surprise question or a particularly difficult one. It is a court of competent jurisdiction.

Can they be prosecuted here or can they not be prosecuted here? Yeah, a fortiori, but -- but your -- your -- you say -- I -- I wonder whether you have perhaps exaggerated in saying there's a mountain of support for your position.

I mean, you told us that there is a mountain of evidence supporting your interpretation of the original meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause. Put aside Hutchinson and put aside the case involving Welsh law that Justice Sotomayor referred to. Can you cite any 17th -- any 16th or 17th or 18th Century British case in which a foreign judgment actually barred a prosecution in Great Britain? Well, there's -- I mean, there are questions about Roche. What -- in the version of the opinion that was available at the time of the founding, was Hutchinson even cited? So this is a mount -- this is a mountain? Do you have any evidence that most of these treatises -- that these treatises -- with the exception of Blackstone, which was every lawyer's bible at the time of the founding. But there's almost nothing in Blackstone about this. These other treatises were well-known to the members of the first Congress and to the -- the members of the state ratifying conventions? They had these treatises on their bookshelves and that was what they looked to? Do you have any evidence of that? But those treatises don't cite any actual authority. What -- what actual authority? What holdings of pre-Fifth Amendment-adoption courts are cited in those -- can be cited in those treatises? You're just -- Hutchinson? Do we have the -- Do we have -- do we have the opinion in Hutchinson? But what about the adoption of the Black -- the Blockburger rule as opposed to the same -- same transaction test? That -- that's a -- that's a rule that -- that's a rule of federalism in a way. And -- and yet it exposes defendants to prosecution for the same acts in both federal court and state court. Do you think there's less reliance here than there was on the issue of the Miranda rule? So you think that -- -- any -- any constitutional decision of this Court that imposes any limitation on any right in the Bill of Rights that affects criminal procedure is always open to reexamination without consideration of stare decisis because doing that would expand the rights of the criminal defendant? That's your position? I mean, there have been many decisions of this Court that have imposed some limits on -- have rejected some claims that have been asserted under the Fourth Amendment, under the -- the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, under the Sixth Amendment jury trial right and the right to ineffective assistance of counsel, under the Eighth Amendment, right against cruel and unusual punishment. And if any of those was challenged, you would say there's no -- there can never be a reliance, and because there's a -- there never can be reliance because it's a -- it involves an individual right, we put stare decisis aside? But -- ",you think that be fair to excuse me chief what be the third what be the third requirement all right it can not be a sham so today let us say a group of american tourist be murder by terrorist in a foreign country and there be a prosecution in the foreign country for murder the same offense in a court of competent jurisdiction there and it be not a sham prosecution but it be a fairly inept prosecution lack of prosecutorial investigative resource in a poor country and it result in an acquittal or a conviction with a very light sentence and your position be that there could not be a prosecution here in the united state under the statute enact by congress to permit the prosecution of individual who murder american abroad yeah well could you just answer whether that be correct or not and if it be not correct why be it not correct but i really do not think you be i mean i do not think this be in a surprise question or a particularly difficult one it be a court of competent jurisdiction it be the court that in that case in that country have jurisdiction to try offense for murder no question about that so your answer be can they be prosecute here or can they not be prosecute here yeah a fortiori but but your your you say i i wonder whether you have perhaps exaggerate in say there be a mountain of support for your position but your main support be a a rumor of a decision involve a prior prosecution in portugal and then the possibility of a subsequent prosecution in england so it be a foreign prosecution so it be true that be not what be involve here but your your argument be base on foreign prosecution well that would be the case if the blockburger rule hold but your interpretation of the term offence in the fifth amendment be perhaps inconsistent with the way this court have interpret that that concept in blockburger case be not that true but do not he do not he say it be the element define by a particular sovereign can i go back to the way you begin i mean you tell us that there be a mountain of evidence support your interpretation of the original meaning of the double jeopardy clause put aside hutchinson and put aside the case involve welsh law that justice sotomayor refer to can you cite any th any th or th or th century british case in which a foreign judgment actually bar a prosecution in great britain well there be i mean there be question about roche what in the version of the opinion that be available at the time of the founding be hutchinson even cite so this be a mount this be a mountain do you have any evidence that most of these treatise that these treatise with the exception of blackstone which be every lawyer s bible at the time of the founding but there be almost nothing in blackstone about this these other treatise we be well know to the member of the first congress and to the the member of the state ratify convention they have these treatise on their bookshelf and that be what they look to do you have any evidence of that but those treatise do not cite any actual authority what what actual authority what holding of pre fifth amendment adoption court be cite in those can be cite in those treatise you be just hutchinson do we have the do we have do we have the opinion in hutchinson but what about the adoption of the black the blockburger rule as oppose to the same same transaction test that that be a that be a rule that that be a rule of federalism in a way and and yet it expose defendant to prosecution for the same act in both federal court and state court do you think there be less reliance here than there be on the issue of the miranda rule so you think that any any constitutional decision of this court that impose any limitation on any right in the bill of right that affect criminal procedure be always open to reexamination without consideration of stare decisis because do that would expand the right of the criminal defendant that be your position i mean there have be many decision of this court that have impose some limit on have reject some claim that have be assert under the fourth amendment under the the fifth amendment right against self incrimination under the sixth amendment jury trial right and the right to ineffective assistance of counsel under the eighth amendment right against cruel and unusual punishment and if any of those be challenge you would say there be no there can never be a reliance and because there have a there never can be reliance because it be a it involve an individual right we put stare decisis aside but ,294.8400000000001,Case pending,"Dec 6, 2018",Terance Martez Gamble,United States,17-646,"Jun 28, 2018",,112,0.0,1.0,0.0,0

2018,Biestek v. Berryhill,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, what I don't understand about your argument is how it connects with the substantial evidence question. Substantial evidence refers to a quantum of proof, and I -- it's hard for me to see why that inquiry is different depending on whether the underlying information in -- in question was requested or not. The -- the argument that you're making sounds like a procedural question, a due process question, whether it was unfair not to require the expert to produce the underlying data. Can -- can you just explain how the procedural question that seems to be at the core of what you're arguing fits in with the substantial evidence test? Well, I know you're not saying that, but you have a quantum of evidence; it's substantial or it's not substantial. Explain, if you can, why the question of -- the issue of substantiality depends on whether the evidence was asked for or not. Well, I -- I see that argument. Now, in this case, was it the attorney for -- who was it who said that the -- the expert was not required to produce the evidence? Was there opposition on -- by your adversary, or was it the -- the ALJ? Yeah, I -- I see that. But, when the -- the expert says this is my opinion, and you say produce the underlying evidence, and the expert doesn't say no, I'm not going to do that, I won't do that, somebody -- the -- the judge intervenes and says no, that's not required, why does that create doubt about the validity of the expert's testimony? The expert hasn't refused to produce that evidence. It's been the intervention by the ALJ. But your reliance on that case raises the interesting question, a question I think is interesting, which is whether there would be any basis for limiting the rule that you're asking us to adopt to the specific situation here, which you have stressed where it's testimony, it's statistical testimony by a vocational expert in a Social Security disability hearing. Why wouldn't the rule that you're asking us to adopt apply whenever there is the question if a determination by an agency is supported by substantial evidence? Can you draw an adverse inference against the expert if the expert sincerely believes, perhaps mistakenly, but sincerely believes that what is requested is confidential?

But that's quite -- that's quite abstract.

Would you say something about what your argument means for the ""agent"" clause? If Congress wrote ""also means"" and didn't put ""includes,"" had it written the term ""employer includes any agent of such a person,"" I take it that one could not be an agent without having 25 employees. But what -- where does your understanding of this sentence take us with respect to agents? Well, if we -- if we follow the same plain text theory of interpretation that you advocate with respect to the provision concerning political subdivisions, wouldn't that lead us to the conclusion that an agent of an employer includes the employer's employees?

Suppose -- I'm sorry. So, counsel, if there's a contract between two businesses, and business A drafts the contract, business B accepts the contract, there's nothing in the contract about arbitration, but a state court -- but it turns out that A, which -- the party that drafted the contract, doesn't want arbitration. B, the party that did not draft the contract, does want arbitration. There's no -- no arbitration clause in the contract.

Suppose if it was a -- a grandparents requirement. So you can't -- you can't get a liquor license in Tennessee unless your grandparents were Tennessee residents. That would not create a dormant Commerce Clause problem? Okay. Just -- I mean, just to understand the contours of your argument, so the -- to pick up on -- on something else Justice Sotomayor referred to, suppose you have a state statute that says for the exclusive purpose of protecting in-state retailers, no -- you must be a resident of the -- of the state for two years, five years, in order to get a license. Would that be -- would that be constitutional? Well, now you're -- you're arguing that they serve a public health and safety purpose, and -- but I thought you -- you answered my previous question by saying it doesn't matter. If the only purpose of the -- of the regulation -- and this is spelled out right in the statute itself -- is economic protectionism, that does not create a dormant Commerce Clause problem because the Twenty-First Amendment gave the states that authority. Well, I think you're turning -- maybe you're turning it around, and maybe my understanding of history is wrong, so you'll correct me, but I thought that the purpose of the Eighteenth Amendment was a determination by those who adopted it and ratified it that alcohol created a public health and safety problem. And I thought the purpose of the -- the -- the Twenty-First Amendment and Section 2 of the Twenty-First Amendment was to say this is a determination, the public health and safety determination is not going to be made on the national level. It's going to be made by the states. But none of that seems to me to have anything to do with economic protectionism. But where am I wrong in that? What is the -- what is the -- the basis for thinking that the purpose of or a purpose of Section 2 of the Twenty-First Amendment was to authorize the states in this one area, dealing with alcohol, to engage in protectionist activities that wouldn't be permitted with respect to any other commodity? As Justice Kavanaugh pointed out in an earlier question, the Twenty-First Amendment is about the transportation or importation of alcohol into a state. How do you get from there to a durational residency requirement that is imposed on the owner of a retail outlet in the state? Suppose I am not a resident of Tennessee and I want a license to operate an entity that will sell only Tennessee whiskey. How would that fall within the terms of the Twenty-First Amendment?
