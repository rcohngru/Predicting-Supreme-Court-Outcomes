2009,"Rent-A-Center West, Inc. v. Jackson",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"You have-- --Counsel, is your problem with unconscionability being -- as described by the Chief Justice or Justice Scalia, being forced to or coerced into signing something -- that's okay for the courts, but this type of argument that goes to the unfairness of the process, that's for the arbitrator; is that your position? So why -- isn't that an unwieldy rule? Isn't your quarrel with what the court defined as remissible unconscionability as a legal matter, as opposed to trying to parse out what unconscionability means otherwise? We just gave you one that didn't: If someone was forced into signing the agreement in an unconscionable way. Could you describe for us what is unconscionable about this contract? What is your claim of unconscionability? He says it's not arbitration per se; it's just certain of the provisions here; if you change the provisions, I'm happy with arbitration. Is that your position? Counsel, I think I heard Justice Kennedy's question to be -- let's not confuse the contract as a whole. There's only one contract here. It's an agreement to arbitrate. So an attack on the -- as I think Justice Breyer noted, you -- an argument that it's one-sided goes to the entire arbitration agreement. I don't want to arbitrate because that's not what I chose to do freely. Correct? That, you say, is for the court. The difference here is that there are provisions within how the arbitration is going to be held that, standing alone, you think are unconscionable, even though the agreement to arbitrate is not. Am I correct in understanding your allegation? You see, that's what I'm confused by, because when I first asked you this question, you said: I would be happy to arbitrate if the court struck the discovery provision and, I guess, the fees provision. Which answer are you giving me? Okay. Let's assume-- --Okay. That -- now I understand that part of your argument. But let's assume that that wasn't Nevada law, that Nevada law would say severability works, and there is an agreement to arbitrate, and all we have to or could do is strike the unfair provisions. Let's assume that situation. Who decides whether to strike the unfair provisions? The problem -- I -- I keep going back to my initial question to you, is you want to parse out what making is from unconscionability, and you want us to say, well, if it's too onerous a fee for arbitration, that goes to the making, because you're depriving the party of -- of an arbitration forum. If it's discovery, that doesn't go to depriving them of anything because the arbitrator could give them more discovery if he or she chose. Am I correct, this is your argument? ",you have counsel be your problem with unconscionability be as describe by the chief justice or justice scalia be force to or coerce into sign something that be okay for the court but this type of argument that go to the unfairness of the process that be for the arbitrator be that your position so why be not that an unwieldy rule be not your quarrel with what the court define as remissible unconscionability as a legal matter as oppose to try to parse out what unconscionability mean otherwise we just give you one that do not if someone be force into sign the agreement in an unconscionable way could you describe for us what be unconscionable about this contract what be your claim of unconscionability he say it be not arbitration per se it be just certain of the provision here if you change the provision I be happy with arbitration be that your position counsel i think i hear justice kennedy s question to be let us not confuse the contract as a whole there be only one contract here it be an agreement to arbitrate so an attack on the as i think justice breyer note you an argument that it be one sided go to the entire arbitration agreement i do not want to arbitrate because that be not what i choose to do freely correct that you say be for the court the difference here be that there be provision within how the arbitration be go to be hold that stand alone you think be unconscionable even though the agreement to arbitrate be not be i correct in understand your allegation you see that be what I be confuse by because when i first ask you this question you say i would be happy to arbitrate if the court strike the discovery provision and i guess the fee provision which answer be you give me okay let us assume okay that now i understand that part of your argument but let us assume that that be not nevada law that nevada law would say severability work and there be an agreement to arbitrate and all we have to or could do be strike the unfair provision let us assume that situation who decide whether to strike the unfair provision the problem i i keep go back to my initial question to you be you want to parse out what make be from unconscionability and you want us to say well if it be too onerous a fee for arbitration that go to the making because you be deprive the party of of an arbitration forum if it be discovery that do not go to deprive them of anything because the arbitrator could give them more discovery if he or she choose be i correct this be your argument ,201.66000000000003,Roberts Court,"Apr 26, 2010","Rent-A-Center West, Inc.",Antonio Jackson,09-497,"Jan 15, 2010","Jun 21, 2010",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2009,United States v. Comstock,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Under your theory -- under the theory that you are proposing, then, any dangerous person, whether it's because of mental illness or any other reason, could be held indefinitely-- --under a civil commitment statute, because what you're saying is that the Federal Government, merely because of their -- their time in control of the individual, has an unlimited constitutional power to then civilly commit this dangerous person. Well, what -- what constrains the government under the Due Process Clause from invoking a dangerousness merely because someone has a long history. We have many criminal defendants with long histories of violent behavior. Many of them continue that violent behavior in prison, and some of them at the end of their term are let out, because their term has been completed. So what -- what in the Due Process Clause protects-- --But that's where I'm trying to understand-- --the connection between the nature of the mental illness and the constitutional power that you are claiming. What -- what is it that gives you that power? But that's -- but that's an easier case, because at least you have an interstate connection to the offensive conviction and the ground for future commitment. But these statutes don't depend on that element being a part of the commitment process. There's no -- there's no congressional -- there's no tie to a congressional power that justifies the commitment other than that the person is sexually dangerous. It's that special relationship. But that doesn't take care of the fact that the prisoner would be released before there was a cure found for the alleged mental illness, meaning supervised release generally has a term limit. Could -- what would happen if Congress said, as part of a sentence, a judge could incorporate a civil commitment finding and say: You are going to serve X amount in jail and Y amount, and then we are going to civilly commit you indefinitely, because as of today, I am finding you a sexual predator subject to a mental illness. Would that be constitutional, and if not, why not? Well, I -- let's assume it incorporates all the protections of -- of this statute with respect to periodic review. So it's constitutional because it's part of the sentence? All right. Because it's-- --Well, so that would be true whether or not you were convicted of a sex crime or a tax crime or any other crime, so long as the judge was making a finding that this was necessary to protect the public? All right-- --But what you're saying is, then, that the nexus is -- the nexus with the need for the criminal justice system or the proper and necessary power to address this problem ends at the point of sentencing, is what you're saying? Well, it says that it exists as a result of its control over this individual, its special relationship, and the fact that at the end of the sentence, it has an obligation to the public.

2009,Smith v. Spisak,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Why? I -- I have been trying to figure out why the State court would know in its decisionmaking that Mills commanded a different result when Mills was issued after the State denied its petition for rehearing. Well, finality in that sense is generally looked at in terms of AEDPA statute of limitations. Why should the same rule apply to the question of whether a State has acted contrary to or unreasonably in light of Supreme Court precedent when the precedent didn't exist at the time it was rendering its decision? How can a court act? We don't have to go any further if we simply address the question, at what point in time are we talking about a State court's decision, correct? Isn't your adversary's position -- I'm sure they will speak for themselves, but their position would be that this is a step further than Jones or other cases because if in fact -- what you are tilling us is that if the jury hangs, the court will have to impose a life sentence or some form of it. But the jury could believe that they could -- that it's either death or life, and one holdout juror would say: Well, I don't want to let this guy out; because those are the only two choices and 11 people want to go for dead -- death and I'm the only holdout, I have to vote for death to make sure that he is restrained in a way that I find acceptable. Counsel, there are two extremes. One is no defense whatsoever, Justice Stevens' hypothetical. The attorney just comes in and says, kill him, okay? And then there is another, which is your very eloquent explanation of this attorney's strategy. If he had done what you did here, we may not be having this appeal. But at some point you can have a strategy and execute it so poorly, so incompetently, that you're providing ineffective assistance of counsel. You are not accepting that that can occur, you are saying the minute an attorney says, I had a strategy, that that is effective counsel, regardless of how that attorney executed that strategy. That appears to be your argument. Well, he actually did say that. Well, but, pretty much, he said, no one's going to fault you if you impose the death sentence.

2009,Carr v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"That begs the question. They were concerned with people who had disappeared, but why is it logical for them to be worried about people who disappear prospectively as opposed to the people who have already disappeared and have failed to -- that's basically the -- the government's argument, which is: One of the main purposes of the statute is to capture those people who have disappeared. And so why limit it? The problem is that the people who had traveled previously and failed to register would no longer be subject to any -- either any registration process or presumably any punishment either, because they were no longer in the State in which the conviction occurred, so any change in that statute wouldn't affect them. I -- I think that I remain a little bit confused by the question one of my colleagues answered, and I'm not sure if this last answer by you is helping me understand it, which is if SORNA now -- if every State is supposed to pass legislation which requires sex offenders who have been convicted elsewhere and moved to their State to register, why do you -- I think that's what you -- that you answered affirmatively for Justice Kennedy, correct? SORNA requires every State to pass laws that obligate people who have been convicted in other States to register, correct? All right. So why do you need SORNA? Why can't those States that the individual has moved to simply prosecute the person for a failure to register? Why do you need SORNA? --understand some of the delay Congress may have in passing a law with specifics about how things are done. Are you worried at all under Lambert whether or not there might be a due process violation in all the indeterminate provisions of this law? Where do you -- yes, you're supposed to register, but States don't have a place for you to register, and now you are supposed to know that you are supposed to register under the old systems, and you don't know how much time to do it in. I -- I-- --Absolutely-- --but they don't have a SORNA place to register.

2009,Hardt v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co.,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"What do you define as -- assuming that we go back to our prior language and use -- in Ruckelshaus, ""some success on the merits"", what's the ""some success on the merits"" that you claim your client reached? Now, I believe that this circuit said, yes, there are cases where we have so held, but that's because there was a cause of action under the complaint that -- that alleged a violation of the Act. But here there wasn't. Here, there was a claim for benefits only, and you didn't get benefits. That was the circuit's reasoning. So tell me where they erred and how we go back to defining ""some success on the merits"" in light of that position by the circuit? So what do you think our -- the meaning of our footnote, Chief Justice Rehnquist's footnote in Ruckelshaus, who said a procedural victory is not some success on the merits. How do you differentiate what he meant by a -- some procedural victory is not enough? How could somebody have some success on the merits if they don't achieve a judgment of some sort? But under your theory, presumably no relief has to be granted? But then what -- what's the difference -- is it your theory that if the district court -- for whatever reason, if this wasn't an ERISA case where a remand -- or where the court said they did violate, but I've now looked at the evidence that you're proffering, the new evidence they did not consider, and it's not enough for benefits; you don't get it. Is your argument that you are entitled to fees because they decided there was -- the court decided there was a violation of ERISA? Going back to Justice Scalia's question, what's the difference between Hanrahan, where there's a violation of the civil procedure code which is an entitlement to process? Why aren't you successful, if this is a non-ERISA situation, merely for a finding that the district court acted improperly? Could you tell me whether you differ in your definition of ""some success on the merits"" than your predecessor colleague? Do you define it as in the manner he did, that it's any legal judgment in the Petitioner's favor that another party has done a wrongful act? I think -- I think I'm summarizing his position accurately. No, that's different than what he said. All right. Yes, here there was an order of remand. That's clear. And I can understand the difference between an order, because there are many decisions of the court that end up in orders that are not final judgments. But there are decisions, like this one, I think according to him, that if the district court had said there was a violation of ERISA and the parties then settled without a judicial order reflecting that finding and/or requiring a remand, I think according to him he would say this party was entitled to fees. No, I didn't assume this case. No order, just a finding. And then a settlement. Well, that seems like a catalyst theory, and that was, at least in dicta, rejected in -- in Ruckelshaus. So how do you deal with that? His point -- your adversary's point -- is the court couldn't effect that procedural move without taking step one in what was requested. It had to find some sort of violation, either to remand or to grant benefits, so that the relief sought, by definition, needed a finding by the court. And your adversary says the court found an ERISA violation. Now, the type of relief it grants is up to its discretion. This is an equitable situation, and it exercised its discretion by doing a remand. Why is that view different than calling it a procedural step? Isn't that a substantive win? That -- that's difficult. Let's assume that a claims administrator or a plan administrator is not deciding the claim. The party comes to court and says: Under ERISA, I have a right to a decision within X number of days; force them, mandamus them to give me a decision. The court says: Reasonable; you have a right to one. And orders them to. Under your theory, they've won nothing? So you're -- you're -- wait a minute. Then we go back to a question that was asked by one of my colleagues. If a plan participant came in and said they didn't consider evidence they should have; they didn't seek my treating physician's documents, and here they are; they should consider them now, and the court says you're right, enters a remand order, and dismisses the case -- that's enough? Well, what -- what's the difference between the first example I gave, a mandamus to issue a decision -- that's not a claim for benefits, either; it's a claim for a decision. What's the difference between that and the second hypothetical? So what is the difference between prevailing party and some success on the merits for you? The only difference is whether they won on one cause of action as opposed to four? So under Buckhannon, 51 percent only entitles you to fees. And under your view of this statute, you have -- as long as you get 1 percent order, that's enough. So you -- you see no difference today? ",what do you define as assume that we go back to our prior language and use in ruckelshaus some success on the merit what be the some success on the merit that you claim your client reach now i believe that this circuit say yes there be case where we have so hold but that be because there be a because of action under the complaint that that allege a violation of the act but here there be not here there be a claim for benefit only and you do not get benefit that be the circuit s reasoning so tell me where they err and how we go back to define some success on the merit in light of that position by the circuit so what do you think our the meaning of our footnote chief justice rehnquist s footnote in ruckelshaus who say a procedural victory be not some success on the merit how do you differentiate what he mean by a some procedural victory be not enough how could somebody have some success on the merit if they do not achieve a judgment of some sort but under your theory presumably no relief have to be grant but then what what be the difference be it your theory that if the district court for whatever reason if this be not an erisa case where a remand or where the court say they do violate but I have now look at the evidence that you be proffer the new evidence they do not consider and it be not enough for benefit you do not get it be your argument that you be entitle to fee because they decide there be the court decide there be a violation of erisa go back to justice scalia s question what be the difference between hanrahan where there be a violation of the civil procedure code which be an entitlement to process why be not you successful if this be a non erisa situation merely for a finding that the district court act improperly could you tell me whether you differ in your definition of some success on the merit than your predecessor colleague do you define it as in the manner he do that it be any legal judgment in the petitioner s favor that another party have do a wrongful act i think i think I be summarize his position accurately no that be different than what he say all right yes here there be an order of remand that be clear and i can understand the difference between an order because there be many decision of the court that end up in order that be not final judgment but there be decision like this one i think accord to him that if the district court have say there be a violation of erisa and the party then settle without a judicial order reflect that find andor require a remand i think accord to him he would say this party be entitle to fee no i do not assume this case no order just a finding and then a settlement well that seem like a catalyst theory and that be at least in dictum reject in in ruckelshaus so how do you deal with that his point your adversary s point be the court could not effect that procedural move without take step one in what be request it have to find some sort of violation either to remand or to grant benefit so that the relief seek by definition need a finding by the court and your adversary say the court find an erisa violation now the type of relief it grant be up to its discretion this be an equitable situation and it exercise its discretion by do a remand why be that view different than call it a procedural step be not that a substantive win that that be difficult let us assume that a claim administrator or a plan administrator be not decide the claim the party come to court and say under erisa i have a right to a decision within x number of day force them mandamus them to give me a decision the court say reasonable you have a right to one and order them to under your theory they have win nothing so you be you be wait a minute then we go back to a question that be ask by one of my colleague if a plan participant come in and say they do not consider evidence they should have they do not seek my treat physician s document and here they be they should consider them now and the court say you be right enter a remand order and dismiss the case that be enough well what what be the difference between the first example i give a mandamus to issue a decision that be not a claim for benefit either it be a claim for a decision what be the difference between that and the second hypothetical so what be the difference between prevail party and some success on the merit for you the only difference be whether they win on one because of action as oppose to four so under buckhannon percent only entitle you to fee and under your view of this statute you have as long as you get percent order that be enough so you you see no difference today ,352.32000000000005,Roberts Court,"Apr 26, 2010",Bridget Hardt,Reliance Standard Life Insurance Co.,09-448,"Jan 15, 2010","May 24, 2010",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2009,Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"However, you haven't in your brief. Didn't you say you weren't challenging the vacating order? You keep saying -- I know you appealed it originally, but the point is that you didn't seek certiorari on that ground. But whose-- --Could you tell me what's the legal error? You started by identifying the first one, which was short-circuiting the irreparable harm. This seems more like factual correction which you're getting into. Put it into a legal box for me. What are your legal claims? Could you go to the second part of Justice Alito's question, which was the issue of standing, both yours and the Petitioners'. What is it exactly that we're being asked to review? Obviously, you're going ahead with the EIS. You haven't sought a stay of that. All right. So what's the basis of the challenge to the injunction? Could you have -- let's just -- if this had -- if the order had vacated the deregulation and sent it back to you, what would you have -- the agency have had to do to issue temporary regulations consistent with the ones you proposed to the district court? But you short-circuited that. Isn't this more akin to you seeking a stay of the vacating order? The district court vacated the deregulation. No one can plant. You and the Petitioners go into court and say to the court: Stay that deregulation with respect to this kind of planting. Aren't you the one seeking the stay? And if so, isn't it your burden to show that you're entitled to whatever it is you seek? So that's the legal error you identify? That's a little different than answering Justice Kennedy's question, which is: Did you preserve the issue that the district court exceeded its jurisdiction in stopping you from further deregulation? That's a different question than whether or not it should have granted your further injunction which is, according to you, a further deregulation. But it's a different question. Am I factually correct that the harm is that from some seed-grown alfalfa, a bee or the wind is going to take the pollen and put it into a conventional field? But is that -- am I right? How many States grow alfalfa to seed as opposed to letting it just grow into hay? So that handful of States-- --is that where the risk exists? You just said the word ""different levels and different degrees"", but this is an all-size-fit injunction. So how is that reasonable when the risk is different depending on the place and type of growth? Could I ask you something? Is that because your farmers -- I understood farmers of hay had huge tracts of land. Do they rent equipment from someone else to do it? Excuse me, could you tell me, just to clarify one factual matter, the popularity of corn and the other genetically engineered crops, is that from contamination or is it just from -- from consumer choice; i.e., that that's what farmers like because it's easy to grow? I have a real problem if the whole appeal is over whether or not the district court should have accepted the agency's views. The agency has told us that it has side-stepped going through all of the regular -- all of the administrative steps it was required to. It may not have needed to give notice, but it needed to do some form of an EA and get comments and do other things. And it didn't do that. So how can we say that the district court acted improperly, when it's the government who is asking the district court to forgive it from doing something it's legally required to do? No, no. My problem is I don't see that argument either in your brief or theirs. I see only the argument that it erred by not accepting something that the government had no power to do outside of the regulatory scheme.

2009,"Mohawk Industries, Inc. v. Carpenter",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"But what if the court doesn't, as Justice Scalia has posited? The court here could do the same thing, depending on the secret being disclosed. It could set up any number of protective mechanisms. The issue is broader than that, which is: Why is the public policy of anti-disclosure any more important in the attorney-client privilege than in the trade secret context? Ah. Are you sure? But isn't the role -- the central role -- role, is to encourage the frank and open communication between client and attorney? That's the purpose of the rule, isn't it? All right. If that is the purpose, the very existence of exceptions infringes that purpose. The minute you create an exception, you are placing some sort of limitation to the frank and open discussion that you are permitting, so the damage is already done. The further disclosure doesn't really serve the purpose -- or help the purpose in any meaningful way. The fact that an erroneous decision on attorney-client disclosure is not going to stop people from talking to lawyers if they really need to and they are staying within the rules. Well -- but that's what I'm trying to figure out, because you are positing that erroneous decisions on disclosures are being made routinely by the lower courts. Assuming, as I do, that there are some erroneous disclosures, but that that's not necessarily the majority, why is there an incremental erosion significant enough to overcome our interests in the finality rule? What is the use -- I'm -- I'm sorry if I cut you off. But what is the use by the adversary lawyer that you are worried about? That the lawyer is going to use the information against your client, correct? So there is a remedy. After final judgment, if the information was disclosed erroneously, the court sets aside the judgment, sends it back, and says, you can't use it in the future and so make your case without it. Why isn't that an effective remedy for the harm that you are claiming exists in the disclosure? You have to a right to choose your lawyer and not to be -- and not to be represented by a -- by a different lawyer, and yet we don't permit that to be interlocutorily appealed. Why is this any greater in terms of the harm that your client suffers? I understand what the court below did. I'm just following up on your point about the importance of this privilege and why it's critical that it be subject to interlocutory appeal as opposed to the final judgment ruling. Are you -- just so I'm clear about your position, are you arguing that all issues related to attorney-client, whether they are waiver, crime or fraud, scope of the privilege, et cetera, that all issues are immediately appealable because the public interest is the same in all cases related to the attorney-client privilege, or are you wanting us to limit this rule only to the waiver cases? So -- but your position logically would apply to everything, wouldn't it? Otherwise, how do we distinguish or make a difference in your analysis? No one is doubting its importance. The issue is whether or that importance outweighs the finality rule. That's a very different thing for you. That is in the Third Circuit. Ms. Resnick, can you go back and articulate what you see as the rule that we have on what is important enough? Because that is what really is at question. So how would you articulate a rule that would apply both to the cases in which we have granted interlocutory appeal and to those that you are advocating we don't. Because it's not just freedom from suits like qualified immunity or double jeopardy. We have granted interlocutory appeal in other areas, including in the Cohen case. But it's only going to jail that gives you criminal intent. That's immediately appealable.

2009,Pottawattamie County v. McGhee,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"But that makes no sense because, if you go down that road, then what you're saying is that neither the -- neither a police officer or a different prosecutor who fabricated evidence could be liable, either, because the only person who causes the deprivation is the prosecutor who uses the false evidence at trial. Now, the Second Circuit in its decision, Judge Newman, looked at it and said there are two causes to the injury here. One is the fabrication, joint tortfeasors. There are two people who can cause any injury and the prosecutor who actually puts the evidence in at trial. That's how you hold police officers and different prosecutors liable because they are assisting in the violation that is occurring. Why doesn't that theory fit the same prosecutor who commits two different acts? One commits the direct violation, and the other act, the investigatory act, contributes to it, leads to it as a joint activity with it. You're confusing -- the constitutional injury is the deprivation of liberty. That's the injury. What causes that injury is not an element of the crime. It is -- the question is have you proven the violation, have you proven the injury. So why does the use define the scope of the injury? A prosecutor is not going to flinch when he suspects evidence is perjured or fabricated? Do you really want to send a message to police officers that they should not merely flinch but stop if they have reason to believe that evidence is fabricated? Am I right that none of the -- neither of the two prosecutors in this case were sanctioned in any way for their conduct? But you have no reason to dispute the numerous studies we were provided that show that as a matter of routine prosecutors are not sanctioned for improper prosecutorial conduct in the investigatory stage, are you?

2009,Holland v. Florida,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"How do -- what in the record shows us that the failure to tell him that by the lawyer was anything other than negligence? What in the record suggests that the lawyer, just as many lawyers do, forgot to call the client, forgot to send him something? What shows that this is more than negligence? Well, I'm trying to find the basis for that finding. But -- but-- --That's what his intent was. People say I'm going to do something, and they fail to do it often because something else comes up, because something has happened. That doesn't show intentionality in -- the failure to act doesn't necessarily prove that it was intentional. Are you -- are you suggesting that there should be a different standard for those habeas petitioners who are -- whose counsel is appointed for them by the State or by the Federal government, as opposed to just a lawyer they hire? That's what I'm hearing you say. All right. So if the standard is going to be the same -- I -- I go back to Justice Alito's question, which is, the Eleventh Circuit is saying negligence/gross negligence, the line is too fine to draw. But there is a difference in a line between negligence, however one defines it, and an intentional, bad faith, dishonest, conflicted malfeasance. All right. Why isn't that a more workable line, given that you can't have equitable tolling without exceptional circumstances? You haven't argued why not, is what I'm saying to you. If exceptional circumstances has to mean something that really makes something exceptional, why is negligence of any variant exceptional? I don't -- you say -- you say ""complete abandonment"". But this lawyer filed a whole lot of things on behalf of this client. He missed a very critical thing, the Federal habeas filing. But it's not abandonment of a client in the sense of not doing anything for the client. So it goes back to my beginning question, which is, where is the line drawn between the types of negligence and what the circuit suggested, which is some sort of intentional malfeasance? Can we go back to just-- --I -- what I worry about is that you're confusing the -- or perceive -- confusing the fact that lawyer negligence may not be the type of situation that Congress was looking at. With the hypotheticals that Justice Breyer listed, which are a different kind of situation, and you are trying to pigeonhole both and say Congress didn't intend for both to be covered. And yet you suggested a little later that they may have intended what Justice Breyer was thinking about. I -- I don't see anything in the structure of the statute that would preclude what Justice Breyer listed. So what can we read to suggest that -- forget about the lawyer malfeasance; let's talk just about equitable tolling-- --in its traditional sense. Most of the cases in equitable tolling, by the way, have to do with court errors. Do you have any idea, before the Eleventh Circuit announced its standard, how many habeas petitions were tolled by district courts in that -- in your -- in Florida, on the basis of equitable tolling, that -- that they permitted petitions to go forward after the statute of limitations? ",how do what in the record show us that the failure to tell him that by the lawyer be anything other than negligence what in the record suggest that the lawyer just as many lawyer do forget to call the client forget to send him something what show that this be more than negligence well I be try to find the basis for that finding but but that be what his intent be people say I be go to do something and they fail to do it often because something else come up because something have happen that do not show intentionality in the failure to act do not necessarily prove that it be intentional be you be you suggest that there should be a different standard for those habeas petitioner who be whose counsel be appoint for them by the state or by the federal government as oppose to just a lawyer they hire that be what I be hear you say all right so if the standard be go to be the same i i go back to justice alito s question which be the eleventh circuit be say negligencegross negligence the line be too fine to draw but there be a difference in a line between negligence however one define it and an intentional bad faith dishonest conflict malfeasance all right why be not that a more workable line give that you can not have equitable toll without exceptional circumstance you have not argue why not be what I be say to you if exceptional circumstance have to mean something that really make something exceptional why be negligence of any variant exceptional i do not you say you say complete abandonment but this lawyer file a whole lot of thing on behalf of this client he miss a very critical thing the federal habeas filing but it be not abandonment of a client in the sense of not do anything for the client so it go back to my begin question which be where be the line drawn between the type of negligence and what the circuit suggest which be some sort of intentional malfeasance can we go back to just i what i worry about be that you be confuse the or perceive confuse the fact that lawyer negligence may not be the type of situation that congress be look at with the hypothetical that justice breyer list which be a different kind of situation and you be try to pigeonhole both and say congress do not intend for both to be cover and yet you suggest a little later that they may have intend what justice breyer be think about i i do not see anything in the structure of the statute that would preclude what justice breyer list so what can we read to suggest that forget about the lawyer malfeasance let us talk just about equitable tolling in its traditional sense most of the case in equitable tolling by the way have to do with court error do you have any idea before the eleventh circuit announce its standard how many habeas petition we be toll by district court in that in your in florida on the basis of equitable tolling that that they permit petition to go forward after the statute of limitation ,233.91,Roberts Court,"Mar 1, 2010",Albert Holland,Florida,09-5327,"Oct 13, 2009","Jun 14, 2010",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2009,Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. v. Regal-Beloit Corp.,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Are you taking -- are you taking a position different than the U.S., that it applies to exports but not imports? I think the -- the Solicitor General's position is that it doesn't apply to any import or export. Is it yours that it doesn't apply to imports? Could you tell me something? Is there -- do you know if there is a railroad line from the U.S. through to -- through Mexico? I know there is one from New York to Canada, a freight line. There are? So your -- I'm sorry. I'm a little confused. Your position is that ""K"" Line -- you are representing whom here? You have a bit of a conflict, don't you? Because isn't ""K"" Line taking the position it's not a rail line, and who are you speaking for when you say it's-- --If it's considered what? If it's considered-- --Where is that defined in Carmack? Where in the pre-1978 provisions or in the current statute is that to be read? That's -- I am trying to find it, statutorily. And what case says that? What case of ours defines a -- a receiving carrier in that particular way? The only one-- --The only one who has -- the board has jurisdiction over is the railroad. It doesn't have jurisdiction over the ocean carrier receiving. And so you are the -- you have to be the person -- the railroad has to be the person receiving the goods, correct? But you are not reading the language. Doesn't the language say the person who receives under the jurisdiction of the board? I -- I keep going back to: What language tells me that particular point in the statute? That's my problem. I always thought that the purpose of Carmack was to ensure rail responsibility, rail carrier responsibility, so that it was one bill of lading with respect to all railroad connections. If that was the purpose of Carmack-- --But on the rail line. On rail -- on rail transportation. Historically you say that? In the pre-1978 Carmack, there is a -- if you want to take a look at it, it is in page 99a of your petition. It reads: ""If the loss, damage, or injury occurs while the property is in the custody of a carrier by water, that liability -- the liability of such carrier shall be determined by the bill of lading of the carrier by water and by and under the laws applicable to transportation by water. "" So-- --So explain to me what happens in domestic water cases. It says that you can have a different bill of lading for the water transport. That bill of lading controls your damage on the water, and it separates that out from damage on the rail side? And the railroad is covered by any damage that occurs on land? So there already is domestically two different forms of liability protection? Excuse me, can I go back to Justice Breyer's question? And perhaps, as I understand this, I think we are all forgetting that none of these liability provisions come into play until there is proof that an incident has occurred somewhere, either on a railroad or on the ocean, correct? And so the issue becomes which set of rules governs that particular incident-- --where it happens. I think Justice Breyer asked you why it made sense that there would be two rules in effect for what happens on the ocean and what happens on land; and if we had it, wouldn't it create great difficulty. I think -- you may correct me. Is your case -- does your case end if we hold that ""K"" Line is not a railroad carrier? All right. As a delivering carrier. Could I just -- just briefly before you answer the Justice -- the Chief. In what capacity -- ""K"" Line is the contracting party with Union Pacific. Under what contract could the shipper sue Union Pacific? If ""K"" Line is -- is the shipper. Regardless of whether the shipment was by them directly or not? I think -- I am a little bit confused now. Now, back to being confused. You are suggesting that from the landing, it's an ocean carrier. And the minute that the containers are unloaded from the vessel and put on land, it becomes a railroad carrier, even though its delivery contract may have ended at that point? So what about -- what is it that you're arguing makes them a railroad carrier once they put it there. Let's assume the reverse is the hypothetical that you -- that you posited. They deliver to the dock, and Union Pacific is the one that owns those three to six miles of connection to its main railroad. It's the one who is going to provide the motor carriage. It's the one who is going to take it from the -- the dock and bring it in. So it's not merely that it has possession of the container that it has dropped somewhere. It has to transport it in some way in relationship to the railroad? When you say ""engaging in"", are you talking about vis-à-vis this shipment? Or is it just in general? Vis-à-vis you?

2009,Hertz Corp. v. Friend,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, the problem with every test is that you can find an exception that makes the application ridiculous. Let's assume that we accept that headquarters or nerve center may have some applicability to a corporation that has a business in a variety of different States. All right. That's -- your situation is perhaps the most attractive-- --because whether California has 20 percent and Florida 14 or 15 percent, to me the differences are not terribly substantial. I can imagine McDonald's having 1 percent in every part of the world, and how do you choose then? California would say, then you -- you go back to headquarters. But I don't know why you start there. But let's posit the simpler situation. Headquarters in New Jersey, but everything else is in California. Your test would ignore completely that -- and it depends on how you define ""headquarters"". If they have three corporate executives, that's the entire extent -- or let's say one corporate executive who started the company and who lives in New Jersey, and he flies out to California half the time and runs the business from there but happens to live in New Jersey. Then you would say diversity is still New Jersey, correct? But you have not articulated a -- at least to me, a meaningful principle in which to set that exception. It has to be tied somehow to the test and why the test in some situations would have applicability and others may not. Because I don't know the difference between one headquarters and two places to do business or three, but I can still see that some factoring has to be done when the places of business are more limited. So what constitutes headquarters? How many executives have to live there? What else has to exist there? And then what is the default rule if those things don't exist? Counsel, all you are talking about is not necessarily nerve center, because in reading the examples in your brief, what you are talking about is: Where is the place where they have the most important, significant, influential contact? Now, the Ninth Circuit has defined that as the place where business is done; you are suggesting that it's the place where the nerve center is. But it goes back to begging my question: Why -- just simply their declaring it on a tax form doesn't make it important, influential, or significant contact. There has to be something more to the test, and it can't be just what I declare my headquarters to be. There has to be some form of activity in that place. That's -- that's the point. Is there -- is there something to a rule that says headquarters is presumptively the nerve center, but a challenged party, whoever that is, can rebut it? Well, that's the point that I raised, which is that the headquarters is not an important, consequential, or substantial. You can rebut it if you can show that it is a shell headquarters. Well, but-- --That's the problem, which is, the party comes in, alleges by summary judgment that -- in a summary judgment motion: This is my corporate headquarters. The other side's going to have to come forth with evidence that shows something. So that it's always a rebuttable presumption. I actually do not know whether public filings define what ""headquarters"" mean. Is there a -- I know you have said it in your brief, but what I didn't know is whether those public filings define the activity necessary to designate a place as ""headquarters"". Why -- why didn't they say place of doing business? That's not the terminology that they used. That would be more consistent with an aggregation of -- of all of the factors the Ninth Circuit starts with. Counsel, what's very clear from all of the articles I have read in the lower court decisions is that Congress may have thought it was picking a well-defined phrase, but, in fact, it wasn't, that the Courts below are confused about what they were doing before the statute. So I don't know why importing the belief that something was clear into a reality that it's not helps us. So why do you -- why do you think that the circuits courts -- the vast majority of them, the third, the first, the second, the fifth, they all start with the proposition that, if a place has far-flung businesses, then the nerve center test should start the inquiry and control it more than in a situation where there are lesser places of business? Well, that's a big difference. I -- you know, to me, the word 50 percent. I'm having a hard time understanding what the appreciable difference is between 20 percent and 14 and the balance being spread over so many other places. What -- that seems very arbitrary in terms of the place that generates the most money. That's it. That's the place you are at home. Well, but that's what -- but that goes back to the point, if we are talking about shields or swords, Congress had before it a provision that would say, anywhere you do business, you are not a foreigner, because you are there. The people are going to perceive you as a business -- the local business that is doing business in that location, and Congress rejected that. So foreign has to have a meaning that was somewhat different. And you don't think the corporate headquarters where management is, where the direction for the operation of the business is coming from, is the place that needs the most protection in this system because they are the ones making the decisions, and so aren't they the ones who need to be protected from local bias? That's the very first little shop was there. Can you tell me what 100 percent means? Are the number of workers in Seattle inconsequential? Is there one worker there or are we talking about 1,000 in-- --Isn't that important? As Justice Scalia said that per capita California is going to dwarf anybody anywhere if you are going to have a multi-location place of business. So don't you have to know the raw numbers? ",counsel the problem with every test be that you can find an exception that make the application ridiculous let us assume that we accept that headquarters or nerve center may have some applicability to a corporation that have a business in a variety of different state all right that be your situation be perhaps the most attractive because whether california have percent and florida or percent to me the difference be not terribly substantial i can imagine mcdonald s have percent in every part of the world and how do you choose then california would say then you you go back to headquarters but i do not know why you start there but let us posit the simpler situation headquarters in new jersey but everything else be in california your test would ignore completely that and it depend on how you define headquarters if they have three corporate executive that be the entire extent or let us say one corporate executive who start the company and who live in new jersey and he fly out to california half the time and run the business from there but happen to live in new jersey then you would say diversity be still new jersey correct but you have not articulate a at least to me a meaningful principle in which to set that exception it have to be tie somehow to the test and why the test in some situation would have applicability and others may not because i do not know the difference between one headquarters and two place to do business or three but i can still see that some factoring have to be do when the place of business be more limited so what constitute headquarters how many executive have to live there what else have to exist there and then what be the default rule if those thing do not exist counsel all you be talk about be not necessarily nerve center because in read the example in your brief what you be talk about be where be the place where they have the most important significant influential contact now the ninth circuit have define that as the place where business be do you be suggest that it be the place where the nerve center be but it go back to beg my question why just simply their declare it on a tax form do not make it important influential or significant contact there have to be something more to the test and it can not be just what i declare my headquarters to be there have to be some form of activity in that place that be that be the point be there be there something to a rule that say headquarters be presumptively the nerve center but a challenged party whoever that be can rebut it well that be the point that i raise which be that the headquarters be not an important consequential or substantial you can rebut it if you can show that it be a shell headquarters well but that be the problem which be the party come in alleges by summary judgment that in a summary judgment motion this be my corporate headquarters the other side s go to have to come forth with evidence that show something so that it be always a rebuttable presumption i actually do not know whether public filing define what headquarters mean be there a i know you have say it in your brief but what i do not know be whether those public filing define the activity necessary to designate a place as headquarters why why do not they say place of do business that be not the terminology that they use that would be more consistent with an aggregation of of all of the factor the ninth circuit start with counsel what be very clear from all of the article i have read in the low court decision be that congress may have think it be pick a well defined phrase but in fact it be not that the court below be confuse about what they we be do before the statute so i do not know why import the belief that something be clear into a reality that it be not helps us so why do you why do you think that the circuit court the vast majority of them the third the first the second the fifth they all start with the proposition that if a place have far flung business then the nerve center test should start the inquiry and control it more than in a situation where there be less place of business well that be a big difference i you know to me the word percent I be

2009,Hamilton v. Lanning,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"What do you -- what do you do with the contention that the court is bounded by other requirements such as the timing of the meeting of creditors and the plan confirmation, that that binds the district court from resetting it? Counsel, why -- what commends going through all these machinations, all of these alternative ways of avoiding absurd results? Isn't the answer simply that we just narrow the circumstances in which a court can deviate from the statutory formula? I mean, it's not -- even before this change, it wasn't that the district courts could at whim change the projected income. They have to have a clear ground to do so. Why is that inadequate to protect the interests that Congress had in creating this new formula for income and expenses? There was a formula before. It was somewhat ambiguous, and that's what led to the more defined terms for income and expense. But that says nothing about changing the court's power to act in a situation where the formula's clearly not going to work. That was the standard before. How do you file an amended plan and have the court restart the clock, when 101(10A) says only if the debtor has not filed a schedule of current income? If there's been a plan confirmed or a plan proposed, then the income schedule had to have been filed. You don't do one without the other. Forget about 1329. I'm going to the situation where the plan has been proposed, let's say. The courts -- if a schedule of income has been filed, then it's without any jurisdiction to change the 6-month lookback period, correct? Well, it can't under 101(10A).

Could you -- could you tell me what the difference is between these video and David Roma's documentary on pit bulls? I mean, David Roma's documentary had much, much more footage on the actual animal cruelty than the films at issue here, greater sections of the film, and more explicit.

2009,Berghuis v. Smith,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"You would suggest that in a population that has 9 percent of any group, protected group, that if they didn't have one person serve on a jury per year of that group, that that would not -- under an absolute disparity test using the 10 percent figure, that would not give rise to any kind of suspicion? It would not meet the Duren's second prong. Does that make any sense to you? Well, I don't think that -- that any court has suggested that the complete absence of the protected group in that kind of number wouldn't give rise to a fair representation claim. That's why this Court, the Michigan court, and many others have said that the absolute disparity test just can't be used in every circumstance. I don't. The question I have you for you is -- that's what you have been advocating, or at least your brief suggested we should. Wouldn't it be better for to us leave this in the hands of the courts to sort of figure out what test is better under what circumstances than us announce a flat rule that would lead to a result like the example that I just used? Well, I agree that if a protected group is 1 percent of the population, that it's not likely that their absence is going to give rise to any flags. But I think there is a difference. I don't -- I just don't know statistically where. And we have to leave this in the judgment of the lower courts as to where between 1 and 9 or 1 and 10 a difference makes sense. And that's what the courts are saying, is: We can't use one test to determine that. And so, what -- what did it result in? It resulted over a 6-month period and a difference between 18 percent underrepresentation and 15 percent. And your adversary says that's not statistically meaningful difference, that 3 percent, because it only takes a difference of a couple of people to change it from 18 to 15. What's -- what's unreasonable about that argument? You can't -- you are comparing apples and oranges, because your pre-spike was over a year and your post-spike was over 6 months. We don't know what would have happened -- or didn't have statistics of a year or longer. ",you would suggest that in a population that have percent of any group protect group that if they do not have one person serve on a jury per year of that group that that would not under an absolute disparity test use the percent figure that would not give rise to any kind of suspicion it would not meet the duren s second prong do that make any sense to you well i do not think that that any court have suggest that the complete absence of the protected group in that kind of number would not give rise to a fair representation claim that be why this court the michigan court and many others have say that the absolute disparity test just can not be use in every circumstance i do not the question i have you for you be that be what you have be advocate or at least your brief suggest we should would not it be well for to us leave this in the hand of the court to sort of figure out what test be well under what circumstance than us announce a flat rule that would lead to a result like the example that i just use well i agree that if a protected group be percent of the population that it be not likely that their absence be go to give rise to any flag but i think there be a difference i do not i just do not know statistically where and we have to leave this in the judgment of the low court as to where between and or and a difference make sense and that be what the court be say be we can not use one test to determine that and so what what do it result in it result over a month period and a difference between percent underrepresentation and percent and your adversary say that be not statistically meaningful difference that percent because it only take a difference of a couple of people to change it from to what be what be unreasonable about that argument you can not you be compare apple and orange because your pre spike be over a year and your post spike be over month we do not know what would have happen or do not have statistic of a year or long ,138.45,Roberts Court,"Jan 20, 2010","Mary Berghuis, Warden",Diapolis Smith,08-1402,"Sep 30, 2009","Mar 30, 2010",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2009,Bloate v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Shouldn't we be looking-- --Counsel, at the time that (h)(1)(C) -- or (D) was being looked at, wasn't it a fact that some circuits had reviewed the prior exclusion as applying only to the date in which there were actual hearings before the court? So isn't it -- shouldn't we be looking at what you did with respect to this time period in light of the need that it was addressing? Well, what's wrong with the logic of district courts who have ruled in this -- in the government's favor, that say Congress was only looking at that particular part of the proceeding -- what related to the hearing, the filing of the motion, its actual adjudication -- but they weren't considering a motion by the defendant for time to investigate, and that can be another proceeding? Can you imagine a situation in which a court grants that adjournment to a defense attorney where we would reverse that finding by the court? But -- it would seem to me that if a defense attorney comes to a court and says, I need an adjournment, and the Court says, you can have it, isn't that implicitly a proceeding in which the court is saying there is a need for this? ""Proceeding"" doesn't mean an act -- it is an act before the court. The entire action is before the court. But it is a proceeding in which the defense attorney is looking at whether there's anything to file motions about. Well, the Senate did. Wait a minute. If a defense attorney comes in to you and says -- I'm a district court judge -- I need time to prepare; granted, I am excluding time under (7)(A). You are saying that is insufficient? But it's not okay for a district court to say, you tell me how much or you have 21 days to prepare motions and I'm excluding time because of that? Local rule from a district court judge: Defendant is arraigned; you have 21 days to file motions. Could you finish answering one earlier question. You said that there is no statute of limitations problems if we rule in your favor. Could you explain why? Could under that retrial provision the court begin excluding time? That's what I mean. Do you have any idea how many convictions would be at risk for reversal under this rule, that would be currently pending and subject to a ruling in your favor now? In a timely manner. Counsel, do you disagree with your adversary, that there is no statute of limitations problem if we rule against you? But is it superfluous? Because what your adversary is saying is that Congress wanted district courts to think about why some things were being -- additional time was being requested. Not all motions by defendants would a district court actually feel were warranted and might say to that individual if they came in: Look; that shouldn't take you three weeks; that should only take you a week. But that doesn't answer my point. Without a requirement that the judge actually has to make a finding in the interest of justice, once the defense attorney comes in and says, I want a month, and isn't the judge required to give him the month because it's automatically excludable? What, otherwise, forces the judge to look at the request and say, ""no; is it really in the interest of justice for me to give you that month? "" So what -- so what additional requirements are we imposing on the judge that the statute itself doesn't command? If the judge always has to listen to the reason, weigh it, determine whether or not it is in fact in the interest of justice or not, how much more burden are we putting on a judge than to say, look, you are right, you need a month; I will exclude it under (7)(H). We have never required the judge to give a litany of each of the factors under (h)(7). We have never required him or her to do a detailed finding. We've just required them to say there's some reason for it. That's what Zedner seems to suggest. Is that a normal course of practice? I've never quite heard of other-- --But then the Court's view a decision or statement that no motions are going to be filed as a request for a waiver of that obligation? Intent to waive. Well, I didn't see it as a motion. It didn't move to waive. It said, ""I waive"". Do you have any idea of how many, if we rule against you, until we -- speaking hypothetically, how many convictions would be at risk for-- --But it's -- it's not everybody who invokes a Speedy Trial Act violation objection. I would have been -- I would have been interested in knowing the effects of Zedner. And how -- what kind of burden it placed. But that's true of all Speedy Trial Act actions by the district court. They always run the risk of forgetting to make a finding. That's why you have two attorneys, presumably-- --to remind them.

Just meeting, traveling to one of these countries to actually do your teaching to a terrorist -- let's say the law said you're prohibited from traveling to meet any of these individuals. How would that be different than the Cuba situation? But it's no different than the Cuba situation. Mr. Cole-- --When -- but the way you define the speech that you want protected is speech that is advocating some lawful activity. So what's unlawful about teaching people medicine and how to cure people from infection? So you see no difference -- you're not advocating a difference in this case between training that could reasonably be used in terrorist activities, because teaching people how to care for the ill could be used to teach people how to care for the wounded. All right? And the political speech that your group is advocating, i.e., the petitioning -- you're not willing to draw a distinction? You are saying to us the case stands and falls on whether or not we accept that this statute regulates conduct as opposed to speech? No, it regulates training. And what -- the question I asked you-- --was whether there was a way in your challenge, or whether you are advocating any difference in the nature of the speech, that it's -- this is an as-applied challenge. And so the question -- because the only answer you have given us is if it's lawful speech, it's protected. So give me an analytical framework to address that question. The government says under O'Brien even the speech that you want -- forget about the tsunami aid speech. Let's just talk about the political petitioning speech, the petitioning for-- --Is there a difference and under what analytical framework would we reach it? If a terrorist was arrested in the United States from one of these groups, would they be barred under the statute from serving as their attorney in a U.S. court? Isn't that material support under the definition that you have been advocating? No, but I'm asking you why. And so can I -- can I ask you something? I mean, part of the First Amendment is the right for the -- to petition the government for redress of grievances. Putting aside all of the other aid they are claiming, the tsunami aid, the training and other things, can the statute constitutionally be read to bar them from petitioning legitimate agencies, legitimate government agencies, to peacefully, using the words of the Constitution, to effect legal change? And that -- that's part of what they're claiming their speech involves-- --training and doing that. But that doesn't-- --answer -- what is the right of the people peaceably to assemble? Now, mind you, I understand this is the right of U.S. citizens in the United States. But what in the First Amendment or even in this statute could justify Congress from barring individuals to petition peacefully United -- world agencies or even U.S. agencies-- --for the recognition of a -- of a legitimate goal? How about training to-- --General, I understand, I could be wrong, that many petitioners or respondents go out to the industry and say we need some amicus briefs, and they flood in from all sides.

You are teaching -- training them in a lawful -- in a specialized activity. So how do we -- there has to be something more than merely a congressional finding that any training is bad. If O'Brien applies, what remains of your case? That analysis of the activities that you are proposing has not been done by the lower courts, correct? They -- they haven't -- they struck it on vagueness grounds, but none-- --none of the courts either subjected this to strict scrutiny or the reasonable fit-- --Mr. Cole, there were congressional findings that money is fungible first for terrorist groups, like -- that if you give them money for legitimate means, that it's going to be siphoned off and used for illegitimate means. So, why isn't that enough, either under strict scrutiny or a lesser standard, reasonable fit standard, to say that you can't teach these groups how to get money? No, one of your -- one of your stated aims, at least of one of the groups is to teach them how to get aid for tsunami relief. ",so why can not there be could the government stop you from meet anywhere with the terrorist just meeting travel to one of these country to actually do your teach to a terrorist let us say the law say you be prohibit from travel to meet any of these individual how would that be different than the cuba situation but it have no different than the cuba situation mr cole when but the way you define the speech that you want protect be speech that be advocate some lawful activity so what be unlawful about teach people medicine and how to cure people from infection so you see no difference you be not advocate a difference in this case between training that could reasonably be use in terrorist activity because teach people how to care for the ill could be use to teach people how to care for the wounded all right and the political speech that your group be advocate ie the petitioning you be not willing to draw a distinction you be say to us the case stand and fall on whether or not we accept that this statute regulate conduct as oppose to speech no it regulate training and what the question i ask you be whether there be a way in your challenge or whether you be advocate any difference in the nature of the speech that it be this be an as applied challenge and so the question because the only answer you have give us be if it be lawful speech it be protect so give me an analytical framework to address that question the government say under obrien even the speech that you want forget about the tsunami aid speech let us just talk about the political petitioning speech the petitioning for be there a difference and under what analytical framework would we reach it if a terrorist be arrest in the united state from one of these group would they be bar under the statute from serve as their attorney in a us court be not that material support under the definition that you have be advocate no but I be ask you why and so can i can i ask you something i mean part of the first amendment be the right for the to petition the government for redress of grievance put aside all of the other aid they be claim the tsunami aid the training and other thing can the statute constitutionally be read to bar them from petition legitimate agency legitimate government agency to peacefully use the word of the constitution to effect legal change and that that be part of what they be claim their speech involves training and do that but that do not answer what be the right of the people peaceably to assemble now mind you i understand this be the right of us citizen in the united state but what in the first amendment or even in this statute could justify congress from bar individual to petition peacefully united world agency or even us agency for the recognition of a of a legitimate goal how about training to general i understand i could be wrong that many petitioner or respondent go out to the industry and say we need some amicus brief and they flood in from all side would that be illegal because the the organization come out and say we need a brief amicus brief from law professor from without pay how can we can ever separate under the definition of this statute teach these member to play the harmonica would be unlawful you be teach train them in a lawful in a specialized activity so how do we there have to be something more than merely a congressional finding that any training be bad if obrien applies what remain of your case that analysis of the activity that you be propose have not be do by the low court correct they they have not they strike it on vagueness ground but none none of the court either subject this to strict scrutiny or the reasonable fit mr cole there we be congressional finding that money be fungible first for terrorist group like that if you give them money for legitimate mean that it be go to be siphon off and use for illegitimate mean so why be not that enough either under strict scrutiny or a less standard reasonable fit standard to say that you can not teach these group how to get money no one of your one of your state aim at least of one of the group be to teach them how to get aid for tsunami relief ,321.7399999999999,Roberts Court,"Feb 23, 2010","Eric H.

Could I just ask you one-- --Under the Federal-- --Under the Federal statute, it's only punishable on -- for recidivism purposes if the prior conviction was valid, because, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, the statute permits a defendant to object. Who has the burden of proof of proving validity is irrelevant. It's not punishable as recidivism unless the prior conviction was valid, constitutionally valid. So why isn't that same standard or proof thereof required either in the State conviction under your -- under any theory, or by the IJ? The IJ fails to make that finding, how has he and on what basis has he ruled that there was a valid prior conviction? But only under a process that requires notice-- --And-- --Counsel, you would suggest, then, that even if a prior State court conviction was secured without the advice of counsel, that would qualify as a Federal offense of recidivism.

2009,Black v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I don't know what's so discretionary and harmful about a bribery or kickback case. Let's take just the limiting principle of the trunk. Whether it's in the private or the public sector, why would, offering, there be any discretion or any sense of vagueness about saying: It's illegal to give a bribery? To get a contract, to pass legislation, it's illegal to take a kickback. There is nothing seemingly vague about that or seemingly troublesome about prosecutorial discretion in those -- at least those two situations. We could then go to the self-dealing question. Counsel-- --does Skilling -- I'm sorry. Directly answer this question: Does Skilling present the pure question or not? We don't know if that's going to be-- --Then what's the source -- and I think that's inherent in the Chief Justice's question -- what is it -- where did he draw the line and where do we go to look to where you draw the line on what information needs to be disclosed? Because if it's not a niece, my best friend is going to get a 1.4 million on this deal. Where is the line drawn, and what is the source of the law that we look to to figure out where to draw that line? So you are talking about private gain? Do I gain something as opposed to -- because that -- I know that is the Skilling case. But if-- --No, but that's -- you have to, because you have to tell us what draws -- you have to give us the source or some source of limiting, of limitation. And that's what Justice Breyer has been talking about. But defined how? That's what I'm -- I'm trying -- material in what way? Because if you don't how by an economic loss to the victim or by private gain to the -- to the perpetrator, then you are left with what substance to the issue of materiality? What becomes important? That the -- for an auditor on April 14th his guy -- or April 1st his employee goes off to a ball game? It could be a huge economic loss to that employer by that employee's decision at that particular moment to go to a baseball game as opposed to working. But the Second Circuit said economic loss-- --that there has to be the risk of economic loss-- --in the private sector. But is the problem the nondisclosure? Or is the problem the -- the self-dealing itself, the fact that the person is receiving a gain? There's where I'm trying to draw the line because I keep going back to -- what is the source of information that would put a limitation on how much you disclose or don't disclose? It has to be -- the issue has to be looked at differently, which is the evil is the self-dealing, the gain the person's receiving. I know, you don't want me to go there because of Skilling, but I'm troubled because the issue of disclosure creates a Federal common law of what's important to tell either the public or a private employer? And I don't know how to define that issue of importance-- --other than to say that it's a gain that the individual's receiving or something the individual's doing. I'm sorry.

2009,Bilski v. Kappos,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"So how do we limit it to something that's reasonable? Meaning, if we don't limit it to inventions or to technology, as some amici have, or to some tie or tether, borrowing the Solicitor General's phraseology, to the sciences, to the useful arts, then why not patent the method of speed dating? So why are human activities covered by useful arts? Well, you are saying they are covered, but why should they be? Do you think that there is some benefit to society from patenting a method to cure someone that involves just human activity, as opposed to some machine, substance, or other apparatus to help that process? Do you believe that that was the intent of the patent law? Are you suggesting they didn't exist because we didn't give them patents 100 years ago? Or they exist because computers have increased-- --No, but a patent limits the free flow of information. It requires licensing fees and other steps, legal steps. So you can't argue that your definition is improving the free flow of information. Well, isn't the manipulation of electronic signals a substance that's different in kind from just a method of how to go about doing business or a method of how to approach a particular problem? Isn't there -- isn't that what the Federal Circuit was trying to explain, which is that there has to be something more substantive than the mere exchange of information; that it has to involve -- it used the word ""transformation"". It hasn't defined the outer limits of what it means by that. But it doesn't, because we don't work in a vacuum. We work in a context. And so it begs the question, because we go around in a circle: What does 1952 that had one set of manufacturing and other items that are technologically tied and this is not? So how do we discern Congress's intent, other than by the use of the word ""process"" in context? But the word ""knowledge"" is not used in the act. So it's not just useful knowledge. It's useful knowledge in relationship to something. Well, if that's-- --Morse's code was not obvious. Morse's code was not obvious, and yet-- --As I understand that case, the only thing patented was the use of his code with respect to the telegraph machine that he proposed. The Patent Office rejected -- maybe I am reading the case wrong, but it rejected all of the claims except those that related to the use of the code with a particular machine. Of his claims-- --that was the only one that was accepted, correct? The same thing with -- well, Bell's patent was-- --Let's not skip over that, because the rest of the claim in Bell related to how to transmit over the wire, correct? And that was what was rejected. How about if we say something as simple as patent law doesn't cover business methods, instead of what the Federal Circuit has begun to say, which is technology is tied to a machine or a transformation of the substance? But I have no idea what the limits of that ruling will impose in the computer world or the biomedical world. All of the amici were talking about how it will destroy industries. If we're unsure about that, wouldn't the safer practice be simply to say it doesn't involve business methods? No ruling in this case is going to change State Street-- --because it wasn't looking at process or the meaning of ""process"". It was looking at something else. Now, if it veers the other way, which is by saying that we exclusively rely on the machine-or-transformation test, that we're precluding applications of the patent law in those fields, the things we can't imagine. Once you announce an exclusive test, you're shoe-horning technologies that might be different. All right. So help us with a test that doesn't go to the extreme the Federal Circuit did, which is to preclude any other items, something we held open explicitly in two other cases, so we would have to backtrack and say now we are ruling that we were wrong, and still get at something like this? Well, but that -- that goes back to, not 101, but 102 and 103. That goes back to obviousness or the standard weeding mechanisms for patents.

2009,Wood v. Allen,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Could I take you back to Justice Alito's question? As I read the lower court decision, it was saying counsel made a strategic choice not to pursue any further investigation with respect to mental health, correct? All right. And they made it on the basis of a number of factors, including the fact that there was testimony that the two senior attorneys said: It's not going to help us if we do or not. You may disagree with whether or not a strategic decision was made or not, but if one can view the evidence in any way as the attorney having made the decision, isn't your argument that that decision was unreasonable? But isn't that what Justice Alito asked you? That's not a dispute with the factual finding that it was a strategic decision. That's a dispute with the legal -- the legal -- whether that strategic decision met the legal standard of Strickland. All right. So we're back to Justice Alito's question, which is, isn't that a (d)(1) instead of a (d)(2) argument, and we -- the question presented only addressed the strategic decision. It didn't address or present the question of the Strickland question of whether that would have been a reasonable strategic decision. It might be your alternative argument, but it's not the question presented. Can I go back to -- just to -- so that we're on the same page in my own mind, what constitutes the State record? Because one of the State amici posited situations in which the record before the State court on the issue that it made its determination would be one subset of evidence, and that, perhaps as the State process developed on another issue there was another record developed, and you're pointing to that evidence in your argument of unreasonableness as a reason for the lower court's decision being wrong. So your use of that other evidence, does that go under (d)(2) or (d)(1)? Does that seem -- does that seem reasonable, meaning the State court is making a decision based on what's before it. Can't -- it can't foretell unknown evidence and bring it into its equation. So one has to presume that its finding based on the evidence before it is correct. If there's additional evidence, whether it's part of a record that's developed elsewhere, not part of what it based its decision on, and if you look at the language of (d)(2), it talks about the record on the fact determined. It doesn't talk about on the-- --So you're changing your earlier answer to me? You're going closer to what the amici were suggesting, which is that record has to be defined narrowly, it has to be the facts before the court? I'm not sure I understand that, meaning often a trial court is presented with evidence that determines something. This was a strategic choice. It may be that later the State court has a hearing on that question, but it may be that it has a hearing on a different question altogether. And you're using the evidence on the other question. Counsel, you don't really want us to say that, because unreasonable, as we've defined it in (d)(1), means it could be wrong, but still not unreasonable. So if we say that proof of a -- by clear and convincing evidence that a decision by the State court was incorrect, you can't equate -- you don't really want us equating that with (d)(2), do you? That's why he -- that's why he starting-- --from, I think what he's saying is, what your adversary responded to Justice Ginsburg, unreasonable really is much broader than clear and convincing-- --evidence on correctness. You don't need it because whether the decision is right or wrong is not the issue. Even if it's wrong, it could still be reasonably wrong. I mean, one could quarrel with that proposition, but that's the state of the law. So, why do you need (e)(1)? That's -- that's Justice Breyer's question, as I understand it. But work it out in theory, okay? Work it out in theory. There are -- you see, the difficulty with this case is-- --one factual matter, was a strategic decision made? There are a bunch of subsidiary facts that -- that were made. If you're applying (d)(2), the Court would look at all the subsidiary facts and decide not whether they were correct or not, but whether they were unreasonably incorrect, okay? If they weren't unreasonably incorrect? So you don't have to get to the correctness question by clear and convincing evidence. If they're -- if they're not unreasonably incorrect, the four subsidiary facts would then support the fifth general question, correct? Either we agree it does or it doesn't, but -- I -- I -- I don't understand why you need (e)(1) because you never need to get to the correctness of the finding. Can I stop you just for a factual clarification? Did the defendant's prior history with his other girlfriend come into the penalty stage of the trial? So this was a wise strategic decision, perhaps, with respect to the penalty phase? It did come in at the trial -- at the sentencing phase, correct? In front of the jury. We're not arguing about the penalty phase. The issue is if the trial judge at sentencing did hear about the prior assaulted behavior anyway, what would have been the strategic decision not to pursue further evaluations because they -- there's no likelihood in my mind that similar assaultive behavior was ever going to be kept out of the sentencing phase. That's true, isn't it? That's one of the strongest aggravating factors that you could prove, correct? The sentencing-- --jury. Not the penalty phase? So that's really -- I think that was Justice Stevens' question, which was, what was the strategic basis of a decision not to pursue mental health information when everything you wanted to keep out of the penalty phase would be coming at the sentencing phase anyway? That's the question. ",could i take you back to justice alito s question as i read the low court decision it be say counsel make a strategic choice not to pursue any further investigation with respect to mental health correct all right and they make it on the basis of a number of factor include the fact that there be testimony that the two senior attorney say it be not go to help us if we do or not you may disagree

trial at the sentence phase correct in front of the jury we be not argue about the penalty phase the issue be if the trial judge at sentence do hear about the prior assaulted behavior anyway what would have be the strategic decision not to pursue further evaluation because they there be no likelihood in my mind that similar assaultive behavior be ever go to be keep out of the sentence phase that be true be not it that be one of the strong aggravating factor that you could prove correct the sentencing jury not the penalty phase so that be really i think that be justice stevens question which be what be the strategic basis of a decision not to pursue mental health information when everything you want to keep out of the penalty phase would be come at the sentence phase anyway that be

2009,Padilla v. Kentucky,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, a plea is something more than: I'm guilty. It is a strategic decision not to put the government to its burden of proof. Your definition of voluntariness suggests that there is only one component to it, do I know what my rights are, as opposed to, do I know what they are and making an informed decision to waive those rights. Your articulation of the rule leaves out the second component: Am I making an informed decision to waive those rights? But how do you do that? I mean, your adversary's argument is in their particular case -- and I know that you dispute this -- there is a defense that could win at trial. And the defendant comes in and says: Okay, what are my choices? I go to trial and I may serve a longer sentence, but I don't go to trial, I may serve that -- I do go to trial and I serve that longer sentence, but it's here in the U.S. and not in my home country, where I might starve to death. I think I will stay here and take that risk. You're -- you're sort of ignoring that component of information in terms of informing the strategic choice of whether to take the risk and go to trial. Well, then that goes to the Solicitor General's position, which is: You may be right, an attorney doesn't have to give more information than what's necessary, but doesn't the calculus change when the defendant says, this is important to me; give me accurate advice, if you are going to give me advice?

2009,Johnson v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Can I ask you something? In your definition, you appear to hinge it on the fact that the force used has to cause injury of some type, that. That appears to be the only definition you can give. But the use of physical force means just the use of force, strong force, violent force, aggressive force, but it doesn't mean that it necessarily has to cause injury. Would my rearing back and slapping you? In those instances slapping doesn't cause physical injury as that term is defined in the common law, which is an injury of lasting effect. You may have some redness for a second, but that's all. Would that qualify as a crime of violence? Well, but violence has a broader meaning. It generally means a strong force or a strong -- physical force generally has some relative degree of -- of impact. I agree with you, the common definition talks that way. Why should we read something more into it, like physical injury? Many will, but don't -- serious use of force doesn't necessarily always. Counsel -- I'm sorry. Please finish and then I will-- --Counsel, you see that you don't have the inquiry. The issue is not whether it causes serious injury or not, the issue is whether the nature of the force used is physical force. And, so, if you look at the common definition of ""physical force"" in the dictionary, which your adversaries did very well in their brief, physical force has in its ordinary meaning the use of some strength, of some power, and generally kissing doesn't require that strength or power, touching someone on the shoulder, doesn't. All of these activities are prohibited by this statute if they are unwanted. So the question is not whether or not they present the risk of physical injury, the issue is whether in all applications or in a substantial number they don't require the use of strength to -- in its application. That's a different question. Mainly because -- now we are getting to Judge Easterbrook's argument about the dime -- you know if I touch myself, I have now used force. How -- I'm sorry. Before you go on, your adversary claims you waived by not raising this as an -- as an alternative in the cert stage. Could you fold that into your continuation of this answer? ",can i ask you something in your definition you appear to hinge it on the fact that the force use have to because injury of some type that that appear to be the only definition you can give but the use of physical force mean just the use of force strong force violent force aggressive force but it do not mean that it necessarily have to because injury would my rear back and slap you in those instance slap do not because physical injury as that term be define in the common law which be an injury of last effect you may have some redness for a second but that be all would that qualify as a crime of violence well but violence have a broad meaning it generally mean a strong force or a strong physical force generally have some relative degree of of impact i agree with you the common definition talk that way why should we read something more into it like physical injury many will but do not serious use of force do not necessarily always counsel I be sorry please finish and then i will counsel you see that you do not have the inquiry the issue be not whether it cause serious injury or not the issue be whether the nature of the force use be physical force and so if you look at the common definition of physical force in the dictionary which your adversary do very well in their brief physical force have in its ordinary meaning the use of some strength of some power and generally kiss do not require that strength or power touch someone on the shoulder do not all of these activity be prohibit by this statute if they be unwanted so the question be not whether or not they present the risk of physical injury the issue be whether in all application or in a substantial number they do not require the use of strength to in its application that be a different question mainly because now we be get to judge easterbrook s argument about the dime you know if i touch myself i have now use force how I be sorry before you go on your adversary claim you waive by not raise this as an as an alternative in the cert stage could you fold that into your continuation of this answer ,156.4,Roberts Court,"Oct 6, 2009",Curtis Darnell Johnson,United States,08-6925,"Feb 23, 2009","Mar 2, 2010",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2009,Lewis v. Chicago,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, the language of the statute of 703 is to ""limit, segregate, or classify. "" So is it your position that the violation occurs at the classification that's announced and that every subsequent hiring has limited someone's opportunity so that they -- there's a violation subsequently under the limit clause as opposed to the classification clause, or it's each event is a classification violation? So why don't we look at subsection (h)-- --that says -- and it's an -- ""it shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to give and. "" --conjunctive -- ""and act upon the results"". So when you hire, aren't you acting upon the results? And how are you acting upon -- you may be acting upon it, as Petitioner argues, when you classify, but why aren't you acting upon when you hire? I -- I go back to Justice Breyer's point. Isn't it, in the very act of hiring, you are using the test results and saying -- each time you do it, you're saying: I'm going to cut off at this limit, and I'm not going to consider someone outside of this limited tier. But isn't that what ""practice and policy"" means? Meaning that each time, as you continue forward, you are using a particular practice, a particular policy? So could you answer Justice Stevens's hypothetical? What is the difference between those people and each person who does not have a high school diploma is not -- and is not hired? Does that mean that the moment that they announce the high school diploma requirement, that everybody who had already received one, whether they wanted to work at this job or not, had to sue, and it's only those people who just received the high school diploma who can sue 10 years later? So what is the difference between the policy announcement that each time I hire, I'm not going to use a high school -- I'm not going to look at people who don't have a high school diploma, and I'm not going to look at people who don't have a test score above 89.

2009,Jones v. Harris Associates L.P.,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, can I unpackage your argument a little bit. Because using the word ""fair fee"" in my mind is meaningless, because it has to be fair in relationship to something. And so what is your definition of what that something is that it's fair to, and -- or unfair against? And start from there, because I understood the Seventh Circuit to be saying: Look, a fair fee is paying market value. If one takes a sort of reading -- whatever negotiation goes on between the two, as long as there has been full disclosure as required, that's the market. So that's fair. You're saying it's something else. What's that something else? All right. So you start there. All right. So let's stop confusing this -- the articulation of the standard, which is -- that's fair. What would an arm's-length transaction produce? And let's go to what seems to be part of your argument and sort of what everyone's skirting around, which is what's the proof that a particular transaction is not arm's-length? The Seventh Circuit appeared to be saying, it's arm's-length when the parties have done all of the disclosure that is required, because then the buyer can decide whether they want to pay that fee or not, and once they choose to it's a fair price. It's an arm's length transaction. You are saying not, and that's what -- that's where I am trying to get to the nub of why not? Why is-- --That's -- now, that's begging the question, because Congress hasn't said a reasonable fee. It did say fiduciary duty, but it didn't -- there is a subtle but very important difference between reasonable and -- a reasonable fee and a fiduciary duty with respect to fees. I'm still begging the question, fair against what. Even if they agree to pay double the price? That -- that's what -- are you advocating that there is a stand-alone cause of action or breach of duty when there isn't full disclosure, even if the fee is within arm's length -- normal -- begging the question of what's normal, but assuming that it's within an arm's-length transaction range in the market? Well, how much deviance, and what is the scope of the range? Let's assume -- let's assume that all of the independent board of director members vote for a particular fee, but the fee is negotiated by an insider, and the insider is the one who does the evaluation, looks at them and says: I think this is really a great deal, guys. And they just fell for it. Is that a process that would guarantee an arm's-length transaction in the sense that Congress intended in this act? Which cause of action-- --under what? So, then their process is part of your definition of ""fiduciary duty""? A court has to look at the nature of process? Now -- now you are adding what has been added, which is outside of the range, correct? All right. All right. But what you are -- but what you are arguing is, if the process is fair, even if the fee is outside the range of an arm'slength transaction, there is no cause of action? Except that they claim that you were receiving additional payment for the services, or some or at least a substantial number of the services, that you claim are attributed by the difference. So they're saying if you compare apples to apples, you are charging twice the amount. If you compare apples to oranges, there are differences because the oranges were different, but you were getting paid for those oranges separately. I think that was their argument. Well, that's the issue of disputed fact. So let's go back. Are you disavowing the Seventh Circuit's approach? Because I read your brief and it doesn't appear as if you are defending their market approach that says so long as the process was fair, any fee is okay. That's how I thought they had reached their conclusion. That's what I'm talking -- I am using his words in terms of case-- --And you're disavowing that? Your positions is no different than the solicitor general's, that there has to be some measure of fair process and some measure of a fair fee, at least within -- in terms of it not being outside the range an arm's length transaction? ",counsel can i unpackage your argument a little bit because use the word fair fee in my mind be meaningless because it have to be fair in relationship to something and so what be your definition of what that something be that it be fair to and or unfair against and start from there because i understand the seventh circuit to be say look a fair fee be pay market value if one take a sort of read whatever negotiation go on between the two as long as there have be full disclosure as require that be the market so that be fair you be say it be something else what be that something else all right so you start there all right so let us stop confuse this the articulation of the standard which be that be fair what would an arm s length transaction produce and let us go to what seem to be part of your argument and sort of what everyone s skirt around which be what be the proof that a particular transaction be not arm s length the seventh circuit appear to be say it be arm s length when the party have do all of the disclosure that be require because then the buyer can decide whether they want to pay that fee or not and once they choose to it be a fair price it be an arm s length transaction you be say not and that be what that be where i be try to get to the nub of why not why be that have now that be beg the question because congress have not say a reasonable fee it do say fiduciary duty but it do not there be a subtle but very important difference between reasonable and a reasonable fee and a fiduciary duty with respect to fee I be still beg the question fair against what even if they agree to pay double the price that that be what be you advocate that there be a stand alone because of action or breach of duty when there be not full disclosure even if the fee be within arm s length normal beg the question of what be normal but assume that it be within an arm s length transaction range in the market well how much deviance and what be the scope of the range let us assume let us assume that all of the independent board of director member vote for a particular fee but the fee be negotiate by an insider and the insider be the one who do the evaluation look at them and say i think this be really a great deal guy and they just fell for it be that a process that would guarantee an arm s length transaction in the sense that congress intend in this act which because of action under what so then their process be part of your definition of fiduciary duty a court have to look at the nature of process now now you be add what have be add which be outside of the range correct all right all right but what you be but what you be argue be if the process be fair even if the fee be outside the range of an armslength transaction there be no because of action except that they claim that you we be receive additional payment for the service or some or at least a substantial number of the service that you claim be attribute by the difference so they be say if you compare apple to apple you be charge twice the amount if you compare apple to orange there be difference because the orange we be different but you we be get pay for those orange separately i think that be their argument well that be the issue of dispute fact so let us go back be you disavow the seventh circuit s approach because i read your brief and it do not appear as if you be defend their market approach that say so long as the process be fair any fee be okay that be how i think they have reach their conclusion that be what I be talk i be use his word in term of case and you be disavow that your position be no different than the solicitor general s that there have to be some measure of fair process and some measure of a fair fee at least within in term of it not be outside the range an arm s length transaction ,301.4500000000001,Roberts Court,"Nov 2, 2009","Jerry N.

Assuming -- that you're making a broad statement, that this has to be brought in the name of the government. Assuming that's correct, does that mean that -- why does that mean that both the U.S. Attorney's Office and the Attorney General's Office, which appear to be two different entities enforcing two different sets of law, why would both be bound? Or just to say the lower court was wrong-- --on that premise. We have another option, once we say they were wrong on that premise, to send it back and let them look at the second question, which is whether or not a private party can bring an action in the name of the sovereign.

It always has to be a government interest. That's what the argument is. You are saying the answer to that is, no, they can bring a claim in their own name? No, no.

2009,Graham v. Florida,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"But you haven't answered Justice Alito's point, which is: What's the difference a month before he's 18 and a month after? What makes us more capable at the 18th birthday to-- --to affirm a judgment that someone can't be -- can't be -- can't be rehabilitated? Well-- Counsel-- --Do you think that it categorically violates the Eighth Amendment for a 10-year-old to be sentenced to life without parole? So once it matters, the question for me is -- help me draw the line -- if 10 is in my judgment too early, why isn't 14, 16, or 18?

You are not seriously suggesting that the crimes at issue here are comparable to a rape or a permanent infliction of serious disability or any of those other very violent crimes that are close to homicide that Justice Alito spoke about? There is a quantitative and qualitative difference between those, isn't there? Well, if we -- if we have already said that you can't impose death on an adult who hasn't committed a homicide, an intentional death, and so for an adult the most serious sentence that we can give them is life without parole, why should that same sentence be given to a juvenile who we have recognized as being less capable than an adult? And why should we permit it for a crime that's not comparable to a homicide and/or something akin in seriousness to that? But isn't it true -- and I think one of my colleagues already questioned you -- that the prosecutor didn't think that this merited life without parole.

2009,Beard v. Kindler,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"But this wasn't the ruling by the court in analyzing your cases and saying -- you know, in six out of the cases -- six out of the ten cases, discretion was exercised, in four it wasn't, and so it's not firmly established because the numbers are skewed. Justice Ginsburg -- you pointed Justice Ginsburg to page 23, and the Court very directly there says, look, we are rejecting the State's argument that the waiver rule was mandatory. And so it characterized your argument that way, that you were saying the district court had no discretion. Well, whether you think you did or didn't, that's how the court described it, so it understood you to be taking a different position. Are we going to correct it because it misunderstood you? Or-- --What court has said? As I read the Third Circuit, it says: A procedural rule that is consistently applied in the vast majority of cases; even if State courts are willing to occasionally overlook it and review the merits of a claim, that that's okay. So what other circuit has said that any measure of discretion or even a lot of use of discretion bars deference to the State rule? How many of those cases resulted in the overturning or the grant of habeas-- --But do we -- what -- what does that tell us about us establishing the rule that you propose? But you are asking us to take away a part of the inquiry. Your notice -- your notice and an opportunity to comply doesn't address a repeated statement by us, which is that whatever test is applied has to get to whether the State court is attempting to evade Federal review of constitutional questions. All right. And so your test does nothing to inform that question, for example, the Flowers situation. There was a clear rule, there was more than an adequate opportunity to comply, and yet we said it didn't qualify for deference because it was clearly, given the circumstances of the State application of the rule at issue, an attempt to evade a constitutional right. Counsel, I don't know how you say that. Yes, it was clearly established that the district court had discretion -- none of the justices below disagreed with this -- to dismiss post-verdict motions on the basis of flight. The courts below themselves said: What we don't have a rule about is what we do with respect to a post-judgment motion to reinstate or how we the appellate court will treat that waiver once it comes before us. Will we apply it to the appellate process as well? I understood the Third Circuit to be saying that it was those two latter components, which the courts below themselves identified as new questions, that it was resolving, that involve new rules. That's as simply as I thought the issue was. Maybe your adversary will dissuade me and concede your point that what the court was saying, the discretionary application, is what was at issue, but if as I've described things is correct, how does your position continue to be sustained? So what you are disagreeing with is the Third Circuit's conclusion of what the status of Pennsylvania law was? Well, Doctor dealt with what will the court do with respect to, not post-verdict motions, but with respect to appeals that are raised before or after flight. And that's what Doctor said? So now the only other -- Kindler now raises a new question: What are we going to do -- according to the courts below, what are we going to do with post-verdict motions to reinstate and to appeals that result after flight and after waiver; correct? That's where the disagreement lies: Did the Third Circuit get Pennsylvania law wrong on this issue. All right. Let's assume the Third Circuit, that we take the hypothetical that they were right. How do you still win? What rules -- I'm-- --What is -- what is your position as to what the Third Circuit was saying or holding? Are you saying, like your adversary, that they were saying because it was discretionary and there were a lot of exceptions to it, it wasn't firmly established? Or were you -- or do you read it as saying, now that you have made it mandatory, that's a new rule -- the waiver mandatory, that's a new rule? It's not what you are saying. What do you think the Third Circuit said? What was the change-- --that you think the Third Circuit was identifying? Let's assume that a lower court in this case had said: You know, we have discretion, but we're not going to exercise it because you escaped twice and were away much longer than most fugitives. There is a presumption that witnesses' memories fade, that it's harder for trials that are so distant from the event, that distant from an event. We are not going to exercise our discretion. Is it your view -- because that's the undertone I'm hearing -- that under firmly established ground that the court would have still ruled that that exercise of discretion was not adequate under-- --Yeah. Sure, it is. But what you -- there is a tone to the way you presented this case that says because they chose often to exercise discretion in the past, if they choose not to in any case, it's no longer an independent State ground. That's what -- is that the point you are arguing? Because that's the question presented. Well, that begs your adversary's question, which is every case has one or more differences in it. At what point does a lower court have to -- can it say, you know, yes, because they exercised discretion sometimes but not others it's still an independent State ground to find forfeiture? By whom? No, no. Stop. Is the relaxed waiver rule one that applies to district court consideration or appellate court consideration or both? At all levels. What is your reading of what the new rule that the State was announcing was announcing? That it was doing away with the State court's relaxed waiver rule? Was it doing it away with its own relaxed waiver rule? What's your position in this case? None of them, including the trial court? By the trial court and by us, is that what you're-- ",but this be not the ruling by the court in analyze your case and say you know in six out of the case six out of the ten case discretion be exercise in four it be not and so it be not firmly establish because the number be skew justice ginsburg you point justice ginsburg to page and the court very directly there say look we be reject the state s argument that the waiver rule be mandatory and so it characterize your argument that way that you we be say the district court have no discretion well whether you think you do or do not that be how the court describe it so it understand you to be take a different position be we go to correct it because it misunderstand you or what court have say as i read the third circuit it say a procedural rule that be consistently apply in the vast majority of case even if state court be willing to occasionally overlook it and review the merit of a claim that that be okay so what other circuit have say that any measure of discretion or even a lot of use of discretion bar deference to the state rule how many of those case result in the overturning or the grant of habeas but do we what what do that tell us about us establish the rule that you propose but you be ask us to take away a part of the inquiry your notice your notice and an opportunity to comply do not address a repeated statement by us which be that whatever test be apply have to get to whether the state court be attempt to evade federal review of constitutional question all right and so your test do nothing to inform that question for example the flower situation there be a clear rule there be more than an adequate opportunity to comply and yet we say it do not qualify for deference because it be clearly give the circumstance of the state application of the rule at issue an attempt to evade a constitutional right counsel i do not know how you say that yes it be clearly establish that the district court have discretion none of the justice below disagreed with this to dismiss post verdict motion on the basis of flight the court below themselves say what we do not have a rule about be what we do with respect to a post judgment motion to reinstate or how we the appellate court will treat that waiver once it come before us will we apply it to the appellate process as well i understand the third circuit to be say that it be those two latter component which the court below themselves identify as new question that it be resolve that involve new rule that be as simply as i think the issue be maybe your adversary will dissuade me and concede your point that what the court be say the discretionary application be what be at issue but if as I have describe thing be correct how do your position continue to be sustain so what you be disagree with be the third circuit s conclusion of what the status of pennsylvania law be well doctor dealt with what will the court do with respect to not post verdict motion but with respect to appeal that be raise before or after flight and that be what doctor say so now the only other kindler now raise a new question what be we go to do accord to the court below what be we go to do with post verdict motion to reinstate and to appeal that result after flight and after waiver correct that be where the disagreement lie do the third circuit get pennsylvania law wrong on this issue all right let us assume the third circuit that we take the hypothetical that they we be right how do you still win what rule I be what be what be your position as to what the third circuit be say or hold be you say like your adversary that they we be say because it be discretionary and there we be a lot of exception to it it be not firmly establish or we be you or do you read it as say now that you have make it mandatory that be a new rule the waiver mandatory that be a new rule it be not what you be say what do you think the third circuit say what be the change that you think the third circuit be identify let us assume that a low court in this case have say you know we have discretion but we be not go to exercise it because you escape twice and we be away much long than most fugitive there be a presumption that witness memory fade that it be hard for trial that be so distant from the event that distant from an event we be not go to exercise our discretion be it your view because that be the undertone I be hear that under firmly establish ground that the court would have still rule that that exercise of discretion be not adequate under yeah sure it be but what you there be a tone to the way you present this case that say because they choose often to exercise discretion in the past if they choose not to in any case it be no longer an independent state ground that be what be that the point you be argue because that be the question present well that beg your adversary s question which be every case have one or more difference in it at what point do a low court have to can it say you know yes because they exercise discretion sometimes but not others it be still an independent state ground to find forfeiture by whom no no stop be the relaxed waiver rule one that apply to district court consideration or appellate court consideration or both at all level what be your reading of what the new rule that the state be announce be announce that it be do away with the state court s relaxed waiver rule be it do it away with its own relaxed waiver rule what be your position in this case none of them include the trial court by the

2009,Mac's Shell Service v. Shell Oil Products Co.,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"When would you -- when would you measure your constructive termination? At what point would the statute of limitations begin to run or stop under your definition? So you -- you would say that the franchisee in this situation would have had to say: I can't pay the increased amount of rent without the subsidy; I'm going to stop. I'm going to leave the premises. And what about the statutory right for a preliminary injunction? When would that right kick in, in this situation? Because the preliminary injunction stops the change of a contract price -- of a contract term, obviously, or it continues it. So when -- at what point would-- --And for -- if for whatever reason the judge says no at the preliminary injunction stage, that's the end of it; the franchisee just has to leave the premises? Can we -- can -- perhaps to bring this to more practical terms, you can walk through with me. I'm going to assume that if a franchisor changes a rent term and the franchisee refuses to pay, wouldn't the franchisor at some point give a notice of termination? What franchisor is going to sit through months and months and years of waiting for payment before kicking someone out? Is it -- is that rationally going to happen in any situation? Or -- or, so that in almost all situations, at least with respect to the leased premises, in a breach of the leased premises, the termination would be -- would have to happen. So why do we need to make a constructive eviction theory when, on a practical basis, there always in this situation has to be a notice of termination, at least with respect to the premises part? I know. But at some point the franchisor is going to have to take over the premises, either by trying to evict the person or locking them out. No -- no rational franchisor is going to raise rent, not have the franchisee pay, and fail to terminate the agreement. But the franchisee could always just stop paying the rent. He doesn't have to leave the premises. Counsel, can I ask you, have you accepted the majority's reasoning in the Dersch case, the Seventh Circuit case, with respect to 2805(f)? You haven't raised that argument in your brief, so obviously, you have accepted their view that 2805(f) doesn't apply to the right to preserve your claims of improper-- --The Seventh Circuit said there's no implied right of action under 2805(f). Well, I would have thought your strongest argument would have been that, if we have a statutory right not to waive any of our Federal or State rights, if there has been a non-renewal on reasonable terms, there has been a breach of that obligation under the statute, then you had a right to be renewed under reasonable terms, and if they are giving you unreasonable terms -- ""unreasonable"" being defined within the statutory constraints -- they impose conditions that were imposed in bad faith to drive you out; those are the two conditions -- then you had a right to sue for that, non-renewal, because you had a right to renew on reasonable terms. Well, but why didn't you make the argument in your briefs? That's why I was asking you whether you agreed with the Seventh Circuit's reasoning, and that's why you didn't raise it or -- what am I missing, that's making that argument not-- --one that you relied upon? ",when would you when would you measure your constructive termination at what point would the statute of limitation begin to run or stop under your definition so you you would say that the franchisee in this situation would have have to say i can not pay the increased amount of rent without the subsidy I be go to stop I be go to leave the premise and what about the statutory right for a preliminary injunction when would that right kick in in this situation because the preliminary injunction stop the change of a contract price of a contract term obviously or it continue it so when at what point would and for if for whatever reason the judge say no at the preliminary injunction stage that be the end of it the franchisee just have to leave the premise can we can perhaps to bring this to more practical term you can walk through with me I be go to assume that if a franchisor change a rent term and the franchisee refuse to pay would not the franchisor at some point give a notice of termination what franchisor be go to sit through month and month and year of wait for payment before kick someone out be it be that rationally go to happen in any situation or or so that in almost all situation at least with respect to the lease premise in a breach of the lease premise the termination would be would have to happen so why do we need to make a constructive eviction theory when on a practical basis there always in this situation have to be a notice of termination at least with respect to the premise part i know but at some point the franchisor be go to have to take over the premise either by try to evict the person or lock them out no no rational franchisor be go to raise rent not have the franchisee pay and fail to terminate the agreement but the franchisee could always just stop pay the rent he do not have to leave the premise counsel can i ask you have you accept the majority s reasoning in the dersch case the seventh circuit case with respect to f you have not raise that argument in your brief so obviously you have accept their view that f do not apply to the right to preserve your claim of improper the seventh circuit say there be no implied right of action under f well i would have think your strong argument would have be that if we have a statutory right not to waive any of our federal or state right if there have be a non renewal on reasonable term there have be a breach of that obligation under the statute then you have a right to be renew under reasonable term and if they be give you unreasonable term unreasonable be define within the statutory constraint they impose condition that we be impose in bad faith to drive you out those be the two condition then you have a right to sue for that non renewal because you have a right to renew on reasonable term well but why do not you make the argument in your brief that be why i be ask you whether you agree with the seventh circuit s reasoning and that be why you do not raise it or what be i missing that be make that argument not one that you rely upon ,269.04999999999995,Roberts Court,"Jan 19, 2010",Mac's Shell Service et al.,Shell Oil Products Co. et al.,08-240,"Jun 15, 2009","Mar 2, 2010",113.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2009,Christian Legal Society Chapter v. Martinez,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"So is this an exception that you want to talk about as it is applied to religious groups, or are you suggesting that if a group wanted to exclude all black people, all women, all handicapped persons, whatever other form of discrimination a group wants to practice, that a school has to accept that group and recognize it, give it funds, and otherwise lend it space? So then, what is -- what is wrong with the purpose of a school to say we don't wish any group that doesn't -- that discriminates? But this sounds like a debate over whether the policy as the school believes it should be implemented is not a good one. But isn't that their choice? Don't we give deference to an educational institution in terms of the choices it makes about effecting its own -- its purposes? And the purpose here is we don't want our students to discriminate. You're not-- --You keep talking about being forced to let people in. And this is where I'm a little bit confused by your yellow brief. The school has taken the position that any group can apply to use its facilities; priority and funding, et cetera, will only go to recognized student groups. But your group is not being excluded or ostracized completely from the school. Presumably, you can meet in the cafeteria. You can meet in open spaces in the school. You can apply like everyone else, any other nonstudent group, recognized student group. But you have been saying repeatedly in your presentation that you're barred from the campus. And so I'm a little confused as to exactly-- --But let's -- could we-- --Let's -- let's assume, because I'm not quite sure what the record is on these issues -- I'm somewhat confused on the factual assumptions underlying this case. But let's assume two things: One, that in fact you have the option of applying for use of the space and that, assuming there are no conflicts and other things that -- that are in the normal course would preclude your use, that you would be granted use. Is your argument different in that situation? There are bulletin boards. There are other ones. Are you disputing that this is-- --Are you disputing this is a limited forum, public forum? What do we do with the selective application argument, which is what Justice Alito referred to and Justice Scalia, which is it is troubling that some of these bylaws do limit their groups? La Raza limited it to people of Hispanic descent, and the Lawyers Guild to people who adopt its -- its beliefs. What are we going to do with this selective application argument? It's in the case, isn't it? And if it is, what does it do to your policy?

2009,Sullivan v. Florida,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Except the court there applied 39(a) and said: Yes, it's a change in law, but it hasn't been made retroactive. But isn't that what the court said here? It said, first of all, Roper doesn't command the results you are seeking; and, second, it didn't make its application retroactive. So wasn't it really consistent with 39(a), the Florida court? No, that's an unfair characterization. What the judge said was Roper didn't say that it applied to life without parole. That's a very -- vastly different thing than saying that the reasoning shouldn't be applied. It said that we are not choosing to, but that's not what Roper said. Can I-- --Could you go back through the statistics for me? For children under 14, how many are in prison for life without parole for homicide and non-homicide cases? There's a certain number of States that didn't respond at all. What do you mean it was done twice? I thought he raped only one person. So your adversary provided statistics to show that other people who have committed rapes have gotten much smaller terms of imprisonment, the average being, I think we were told, 10 years. So explain to me why someone who commits a rape is getting 10 years and this 13-year-old -- it's the most heinous crime for a 13-year-old that justifies life without parole. What did the Florida -- what do the Florida courts do with that series of cases in your footnote, in the yellow brief, where it did apply Apprendi after? Did it rule that it wasn't retroactive? What did it do in those cases-- --to consider the Apprendi challenges? If you are wrong and they did do exactly what your adversary said and considered the issue of the legality of the sentence under Apprendi, does that vitiate your argument here? Is your -- does that make your adversary's argument correct? You are missing the point. What Florida says and what your adversary is saying is -- you're absolutely right, if you win under Graham, you could go under 39.a -- if you win under Graham, and Graham makes its rule retroactive, that fits right into (b)(2) directly, and so those cases you have no problems with.

2009,"Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates, P.A. v. Allstate Insurance Co.",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I'm sorry. Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical was you are entitled to $100 as a statutory penalty but only if it's an individual claim. If you -- if this is brought as a class action, you don't get the statutory penalty. I thought that was the substance of her question. Now, are you saying that also is merely procedural and -- and pre-empted by Rule 23? Counsel, you get $100 or you don't get $100. How can you be any less substantive than getting the $100 or not getting the $100? Then under your view, there is absolutely nothing, no law that the State could pass that would not conflict with Rule 23-- --as it -- as with respect to class actions? You mean the State could do. But isn't Rule 23 a judgment by Congress that class actions that meet the criteria of Rule 23 are fair and efficient, correct? That's Congress's judgment? Under your theory, any State could pass a law that says no cause of action under State law can be brought as a class action ever. That would be your theory because it's substantive, if it's an Erie choice. You haven't quite answered my question. Your State can come in and say, no State cause of action will ever be subject to class treatment. And you would say there is no conflict between that and Rule 23? No. No State cause of action can be brought as a class. You're saying there is no conflict with Rule 23's judgment about efficiency of Federal court litigation? Just what it's doing here. There are some things -- we make a policy choice, the State, that, contrary to Rule 23, that there are some causes of action that are not fairly and efficiently brought as a class. That's what the State has said as a policy choice, correct? It's a policy choice. So you have answered my question. Under your view, a State could say, no class actions. And -- and a Federal court, sitting in diversity, could never aggregate those claims, those State law claims? Counsel, how can you say that? The case itself says: We read the language of the statute; Congress didn't say this was to be a class action; we are not permitting it. I understand the difference, and it could have argued or analyzed the case the way you said, but the appellate division there did exactly what your adversary said it did.

2009,Maryland v. Shatzer,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"What if he asks for a lawyer. He said: I don't want to talk to you without a lawyer, correct? And the State doesn't provide him with a lawyer, correct? All right. So what gives him an understanding that one will be provided the next time he's questioned? No, because we tell the police they have to stop. So presumably they shouldn't re-engage until the lawyer is present, correct? That's what Edwards tells them not to do. Well, this is a different part of your argument. This is not the custody or break in custody. This is the time and the fact that such a prolonged period of time has minimized any coercive effect, correct? Catch and release then no longer -- catch and release is unimportant to you? There is no meaning to Edwards in that situation, because every prisoner, because he is a captive, is questioned in a place and then told to go back to his room. His room happens to be a locked cell. So he doesn't have the freedom to leave and he doesn't have the freedom necessarily to make calls to discuss his choice with anyone. This is a very different situation then someone who is free to go home. Because he is not in custody, when he is in jail. When he can't leave, can't necessarily use a phone and can't confer with anyone he's no longer in custody. --What's the smallest-- --Counsel, the hypothetical you are positing is an investigation about unrelated crimes. We are talking about, and I think it's what Justice Ginsburg was pointing to, it was an invocation on this crime, on this criminal activity, not one in another State or another police department. And so that's a substantially different question. What is the shortest time period that any circuit court has found a break in custody in a similar situation? Between the invocation of counsel and a requestioning. You said a number of circuit courts have recognized this break in custody theory. Which are days? Any are days? I don't want to interrupt that, but there were two aspects to Edwards. One was the coercion, but the other was the respect for the advisement of counsel. And so the test that you are proposing only addresses the coercion prong of it, not the respect for the invocation of counsel. Can I ask something? What does that have to do with the hypothetical Justice Alito gave you, which is the person is not in custody, right? He is arrested for joy riding; he is let go; and you are saying that for 20, 40 years he is now immunized from being reapproached by the police under the Edwards rule? So you are advocating that no break in custody ever stops the Edwards clock. But you are now -- you are now accepting your adversary's point that somehow a -- a change from a locked room in a prison to a different locked room is a release from custody. If we don't -- if we don't accept that proposition, isn't there a clear break when someone is let to go home? When someone is released and permitted to go home? Counsel, we-- --We don't have a case. None of the cases in this area, where we have applied Edwards, has dealt with a situation with -- where a prisoner has been released from custody, in any sense of that word, i.e., sent home. In all of the three situations that I am aware of, in which the Edwards rule has applied, the prisoner has stayed in jail -- some form of jail. Correct? Well-- --Could I have a clarification of the facts for a moment? In 2003, he was in one State facility, a sentenced prisoner. Correct? And he was just moved from one State prison to another. He wasn't in pretrial detention in either of these timeframes. Correct? We are just talking about a change in facility, not in status? What were the circumstances? I don't recall the case. Was the prisoner in a prison the entire 24 hours? Or was the individual released home, that sort of-- --Your adversary says that they -- he can't change his mind. It has to be a spontaneous, you know, somehow they have to be in a room together that wasn't planned and he has to come up and say, I am confessing out of the kindness of my heart. The police can't even approach him, according to you, once he has invoked counsel, to ask him whether he wants to change his mind. That's the point. So there is no termination point, really? But -- but there was no difference in those cases, as I understand it. Each of the prisoners was in a particular room being questioned, and then he was released into a more general room later. And brought back. There is no difference between that and a holding cell, a maintenance room, and being put back into general prison to go sleep. ",what if he ask for a lawyer he say i do not want to talk to you without a lawyer correct and the state do not provide him with a lawyer correct all right so what give him an understanding that one will be provide the next time he be question no because we tell the police they have to stop so presumably they should not re engage until the lawyer be present correct that be what edwards tell them not to do well this be a different part of your argument this be not the custody or break in custody this be the time and the fact that such a prolonged period of time have minimize any coercive effect correct catch and release then no longer catch and release be unimportant to you there be no meaning to edwards in that situation because every prisoner because he be a captive be question in a place and then tell to go back to his room his room happen to be a locked cell so he do not have the freedom to leave and he do not have the freedom necessarily to make call to discuss his choice with anyone this be a very different situation then someone who be free to go home because he be not in custody when he be in jail when he can not leave can not necessarily use a phone and can not confer with anyone he be no longer in custody what be the small counsel the hypothetical you be posit be an investigation about unrelated crime we be talk about and i think it be what justice ginsburg be point to it be an invocation on this crime on this criminal activity not one in another state or another police department and so that be a substantially different question what be the short time period that any circuit court have find a break in custody in a similar situation between the invocation of counsel and a requestioning you say a number of circuit court have recognize this break in custody theory which be day any be day i do not want to interrupt that but there we be two aspect to edward one be the coercion but the other be the respect for the advisement of counsel and so the test that you be propose only address the coercion prong of it not the respect for the invocation of counsel can i ask something what do that have to do with the hypothetical justice alito give you which be the person be not in custody right he be arrest for joy riding he be let go and you be say that for year he be now immunize from be reapproached by the police under the edward rule so you be advocate that no break in custody ever stop the edward clock but you be now you be now accept your adversary s point that somehow a a change from a locked room in a prison to a different locked room be a release from custody if we do not if we do not accept that proposition be not there a clear break when someone be let to go home when someone be release and permit to go home counsel we we do not have a case none of the case in this area where we have apply edward have deal with a situation with where a prisoner have be release from custody in any sense of that word ie send home in all of the three situation that i be aware of in which the edward rule have apply the prisoner have stay in jail some form of jail correct well could i have a clarification of the fact for a moment in he be in one state facility a sentenced prisoner correct and he be just move from one state prison to another he be not in pretrial detention in either of these timeframes correct we be just talk about a change in facility not in status what we be the circumstance i do not recall the case be the prisoner in a prison the entire hour or be the individual release home that sort of your adversary say that they he can not change his mind it have to be a spontaneous you know somehow they have to be in a room together that be not plan and he have to come up and say i be confess out of the kindness of my heart the police can not even approach him accord to you once he have invoke counsel to ask him whether he want to change his mind that be the point so there be no termination point really but but there be no difference in those case as i understand it each of the prisoner be in a particular room be question and then he be release into a more general room later and bring back there be no difference between that and a hold cell a maintenance room and be put back into general prison to go sleep ,275.44,Roberts Court,"Oct 5, 2009",Maryland,"Michael Blaine Shatzer, Sr.",08-680,"Jan 26, 2009","Feb 24, 2010",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

The purpose of the convention is which court will decide the life of that child, correct? And to avoid, as I understood the convention structure, this flight from court to court and this long, drawn-out process from country to country over who's going to make that choice, correct? And so the idea is, whether it's one custody right -- correct me if I am wrong -- whether it's one custody right or many, which court is going to decide what's in the best interest of that child? Counsel, you said in your brief that this position by the Solicitor General is long-standing. I'm quoting. What do we look to, to see how far back and under how many administrations this position has been taken and in what form? But we have been a part of the Special Commission since 1989, correct? Is there anything in the history of the negotiation and passage of the -- of the treaty that -- that reflects what the U.S.'s position was on this particular issue? Let's assume there's a law that says joint custody; mom can determine the place to live; mom can determine the education of the child; dad can visit when he wants; dad can review choices but not veto them. But we consider this joint custody. Under your view, what defines custody under the convention in a way that would justify an American court saying, that's not a custodial right; even though the law of that domestic jurisdiction defines that and says, that's our terms of joint custody, but we create this kind of joint custody? Right. Regardless of what the terms of that right are, so long as the domestic law deems it such, correct? Well, except the -- the convention doesn't define custodial rights, correct? It doesn't give them meaning except in one way, the right to determine a place of residence, correct? Now, that's a little tough, because parents provide care in so many different ways. And weren't the convention members very cognizant of the fact that in different countries that has different meanings? That's not the word they used. They used ""custody rights including determining the place of residence. "" So they didn't give any greater meaning to the word ""care"" than that. The convention article 13 starts at 14, right?

2009,Briscoe v. Virginia,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"The State court has interpreted their provision to give the defendant the choice of subpoenaing the witness or asking the State to bring in the witness. Why is that overruling Melendez-Diaz? Well, how is that different from a notice statute? If-- --If we take the statute as the State supreme court has read it-- --they say: In my mind, it's a notice statute; tell the prosecutor you either want them to call the witness or you subpoena the witness. That's what the State court has told us. Whether or not you had notice of that interpretation is a separate question. Let's separate out the two questions. So that's our first question-- --Does the Confrontation Clause require, not just the ability to cross-examine-- --but an affirmative obligation to place the witness on the stand? Could I just ask you one-- --Would swearing the witness in and saying to the witness ""Is this your report""? and the witness saying ""Yes"" -- what would be unconstitutional about that, given our case law that says that any prior statements by a witness are admissible once the witness is on the stand or constitutionally admissible once they are on the stand? No, no, no. ""Should"" is a different question than the one I asked. Do you have anything historically or in any case that would suggest that that is a constitutional requirement? I mean, I do accept that there is plenty that says you have a right to be-- --to confront the witness. But what would require the prosecutor to actually do more than I just suggested? ""Is this your statement? "" ""Is this your lab report? "" It's not terribly persuasive. I don't disagree with you. It's a matter of trial tactic, but I'm not talking about trial tactic. Well, but -- so what difference? That's because there's nothing in evidence about the incident, correct? And that was a-- --Those were found -- I don't -- were those found as violations of the Confrontation Clause? Or due process? On the past recollection recorded, the witness doesn't stand by the statement. The witness says: I made the statement, have no current knowledge; I can't stand by it or not stand by it. You are asking us now to state something that you admit is in really no constitutional case or historical case, that says the right to confrontation means that the witness has to tell the story, and the form of telling that story has to be a verbal recitation; it can't be past recorded recollection because you just said they have to tell the story. It can't be based on official documents or anything else, because it has to be their story. Am I hearing you wrong? Why -- and -- I trust the trial process, and much of your brief was talking about that process-- --and the fact that it's much more effective when the witness tells their story and you get a chance to cross-examine than if you have to start from the platform of cross-examination. Once a defendant makes it known that a -- he's going to cross-examine a lab technician, don't you think that in the vast majority of cases the prosecutor is going to put that witness on? And if he does or doesn't, why shouldn't we leave it to the normal trial strategy and practice to leave to that prosecutor the burden of non-persuasion, which is what confrontation was about? Which is-- --Well -- well, I was starting from a different proposition than you did-- --because I think that's a question for your adversaries: How could you have known-- --that you should have asked the State to bring that witness in? But putting that aside-- --assume we are reading it the way the Court has now. It goes -- that goes to the waiver question. How did they know at trial that they were supposed to say to you: I don't want a subpoena; you bring them in. But you're -- you're still begging the question. How -- they did what any reasonable defendant would do and say: I object to the admission of this lab report; I have a right under the Confrontation Clause to have the -- the lab technician here. And the Commonwealth court said, no, you don't. And so did the court on appeal. How did they know that this was a noticeand -- demand statute as opposed to a subpoena statute? Could I ask you: If we were to -- how do we articulate a rule, or do we need to, that would take care of the fears of your adversary that trials would become trials by affidavit, that the -- that prosecutors will choose to put all witnesses on -- by videotape, by affidavit, by deposition, whatever mode they choose except bringing them into court -- and forcing defendants then to call the witnesses and do a what's -- what I call a cold-cross? What rule would we announce in this case-- --that would avoid -- what constitutional construction of the Confrontation Clause would we issue that would protect against that? No, no. Forget the practical. Talk about the legal, constitutional. Could you -- are you suggesting or are you saying even a trial by affidavit is okay under the Confrontation Clause? Is that your position? So you are absolutely saying that, under the Confrontation Clause, trial by affidavit of any witness would be okay. So are you -- are you then saying that there is some other constitutional limit to that choice, outside of the Confrontation Clause? And if you are, what would be that other constitutional limit? So do we say to them, contrary to what Melendez-Diaz is, that subpoena statutes -- when you read the statute, it says the defendant has to subpoena the witness. On its -- on the face of this statute, without the Commonwealth court's gloss on it-- ",the state court have interpret their provision to give the defendant the choice of subpoena the witness or ask the state to bring in the witness why be that overrule melendez diaz well how be that different from a notice statute if if we take the statute as the state supreme court have read it they say in my

2009,"Levin v. Commerce Energy, Inc.",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"--State law is unclear here that would require Federal interpretation?

Why do we have to create another exception to Hibbs and not go to another established abstention doctrine? So why did you -- did you argue Pullman in the court below? No, no, no, no. Did you cite Pullman and did you argue it on a Pullman abstention basis? Let's assume that States have a law that said, we are going to do different tax schemes for African Americans than from whites. And they do exactly what is done here. They are going to tax on one thing but not on another. They are going to give an exemption in one area, but not another. Is that a case that would have to be -- an equal protection challenge that would have to be decided in State court? I don't know if that is an answer to my question or not.

You don't think that the meaning of State law in terms of what is comparable or not, is not implicated by any of these questions?

2009,Schwab v. Reilly,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Has that happened in the two circuits that apply a rule similar to this, the Sixth and the Third? Now, under your rule, the trustee has 30 days to get this good faith basis. Does that mean that he or she has to get a valuation on everything that's listed at full value, that that is really the burden we're talking about? It's not the burden of filing a piece of paper that says I want an a exemption, or even one that says I have an objection. It's what it takes to support that objection and how much effort goes to that activity. No, there's a huge difference between a rule that says you don't have to actually go after this information in a formal way. If someone's claiming only the exempt amount, then I'll go ahead and I'll administer the estate, and over time I'll talk informally to people and get a sense of whether the valuation is right or not, but I won't actually -- actually have to get a formal appraisal because I'll just use my judgment. Your rule would require something else. They would have to get the appraisal to lodge the request for an extension or to lodge the request for an objection. Counsel, in -- what's interesting is that all of the circuits or most, the majority, have not announced the fixed rule. The rule they've said is: It depends on the circumstances. And so it appears to me that most of the courts are saying to us: We don't want a default rule, because we have to see what has happened and see what has happened between the parties to determine in one situation rather than another what the intent was. It's not an irrational rule. Why shouldn't we be considering that as an alternative? Because once we make an announcement like the one that you're proposing, it is an inducement to undervalue your property, for a debtor, because -- in the hopes that an overly worked trustee won't have either the time or opportunity or wherewithal to understand that the value is off and that they're going to lose something that the estate is entitled to. No. There are comparable circuit court opinions and situations very analogous to this one, where the circuit courts have looked at what the trustee and the debtor have done during the process. And if the debtor has not made it clear that they're seeking the full value of the property, as happened here, there was a conversation that the value was off, the debtor did not tell the trustee that she was claiming the full amount of the property. And there are analogous situations where the circuits have said, no, that doesn't show your intent because you didn't articulate it to the trustee in the informal meetings. That's not an irrational conclusion by those circuits. No. What it says is, if you're engaged in good faith negotiation over a value or over the claimed exemption, you should -- both sides should be open about it. Most of these cases, the objections are -- the discussions are not at the time of objection. They are at the time of the creditors' meeting. It is part of the discussion. That's what the courts are looking to. What's happening between the parties? Have they made their intent clear, and what does that intent reflect? ",have that happen in the two circuit that apply a rule similar to this the sixth and the third now under your rule the trustee have day to get this good faith basis do that mean that he or she have to get a valuation on everything that be list at full value that that be really the burden we be talk about it be not the burden of file a piece of paper that say i want an a exemption or even one that say i have an objection it be what it take to support that objection and how much effort go to that activity no there be a huge difference between a rule that say you do not have to actually go after this information in a formal way if someone s claim only the exempt amount then I will go ahead and I will administer the estate and over time I will talk informally to people and get a sense of whether the valuation be right or not but i will not actually actually have to get a formal appraisal because I will just use my judgment your rule would require something else they would have to get the appraisal to lodge the request for an extension or to lodge the request for an objection counsel in what be interest be that all of the circuit or most the majority have not announce the fixed rule the rule they have say be it depend on the circumstance and so it appear to me that most of the court be say to us we do not want a default rule because we have to see what have happen and see what have happen between the party to determine in one situation rather than another what the intent be it be not an irrational rule why should not we be consider that as an alternative because once we make an announcement like the one that you be propose it be an inducement to undervalue your property for a debtor because in the hope that an overly work trustee will not have either the time or opportunity or wherewithal to understand that the value be off and that they be go to lose something that the estate be entitle to no there be comparable circuit court opinion and situation very analogous to this one where the circuit court have look at what the trustee and the debtor have do during the process and if the debtor have not make it clear that they be seek the full value of the property as happen here there be a conversation that the value be off the debtor do not tell the trustee that she be claim the full amount of the property and there be analogous situation where the circuit have say no that do not show your intent because you do not articulate it to the trustee in the informal meeting that be not an irrational conclusion by those circuit no what it say be if you be engage in good faith negotiation over a value or over the claimed exemption you should both side should be open about it most of these case the objection be the discussion be not at the time of objection they be at the time of the creditor meeting it be part of the discussion that be what the court be look to what be happen between the party have they make their intent clear and what do that intent reflect ,215.76,Roberts Court,"Nov 3, 2009",William G.

2009,Doe #1 v. Reed,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I'm -- I'm trying to separate out the harassment aspects of this case from the working proposition that there's some sort of freedom of association, of privacy. Your theory, putting harassment aside, would invalidate all of the State laws that require disclosure of voter registration lists, correct? All of those States like New York that permit public review of voter registration lists and party affiliations, et cetera -- that's illegal? That's unconstitutional? Explain to me the difference. And -- well, one other aspect of State legislative -- I can only work from New York because I know it intimately, but it is a State that also permits or requires that petitions for candidate listing on the ballot be public as well. New York relies in part, as this State does, on the public reviewing those petitions. Would that be invalid as well, for a candidate's running? So explain to me what the difference is in those three situations. With -- with the State's interest. You don't think that -- putting aside this kind of referendum, just a hypothetical referendum having to do with a certain tax scheme -- you don't think the voters would be interested in knowing what kinds of people in what occupations are interested in that particular tax benefit or not? Counsel, if we create this right of -- this constitutional right of association in the manner that you are describing it, why is it limited to the voting area? Would we be inviting review if a group of citizens get together and send a letter to an agency that says please pass X regulation, or rescind Y regulation? Would the agency be prohibited from making that letter public? So you're -- you're suggesting-- --that when a petitioner or a person engages in political discourse with the government, that they -- when they choose to do it, because the government is not compelling them to write to it; it's not compelling them to sign the referendum. It's just-- --But it's -- but Ms. McIntyre wasn't asking the government to engage its process in her favor. She was asking for political reform, but she wasn't asking to engage the government process on her behalf. Weren't two of the Petitioners here -- weren't two of the Petitioners here seeking the list so that they could go over the certification process the State had done to ensure that they had certified all the right people, et cetera? I'm not going to the privacy questions. You responded to Justice Ginsburg by saying that there was no way to challenge the State's process of validation, and that -- I don't think that's correct. Oh. That's assuming the answer, meaning if they don't have the right to access, they can't. But, legally, they can challenge it if they find on the petitions that things were erroneously counted by the State. They can go into court and prove that. How much time are we talking about in those processes? Yes. No, no, no. I'm trying to get the relationship between the disks being made available and the verification process.

2009,Barber v. Thomas,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, I'm -- perhaps I can, if you will permit me, rephrase Justice Alito's question in sort of the more simplistic way I looked at it. Why is it that we have to do the calculation that you're talking about, which is start at 311 days and take back days, which makes no sense to me, or their very complicated ten-page number? Why can't they just take 54 days at the end of every year that there is actual service, and that the time served, plus whatever number of days have been earned, you subtract it from the term of imprisonment? So if he was imprisoned for 10 years, he got 540 days for whatever it is. At the end of the 9th year, he made up whatever -- you added up 9 times 54, and you took it away from 10. He serves 9 and that. That would make sense of ""beyond the time served"" language that's in this provision. Well, do you do it if you take (a), and (a) says: A prisoner shall be released by the Bureau of Prisons on the date of the expiration of the prisoner's term of imprisonment -- 10 years, we are assuming, an imprisonment -- less any time credited towards the service of the prisoner's sentence, as provided in subsection (b). So each year that he served, you add up the number of days he has served, the good time credit, and you subtract them from the 120 months that you have given him, and you figure out when he's going to get out. You work backwards, not forward, the way everyone seems to be doing. But that's the way the language is written. So I mean you may want the greater opportunity, but it says by its explicit phrase: Terms: At the date of the prisoner's -- expiration of the prisoner's term of imprisonment, take that day and subtract from it time credited towards the service of the prisoner's sentence. And then what do-- --So the next year-- --you start it at 311? And he now serves another year and you back him up again at the end of that year? To 300-- --And you -- and you think that their system is easier? That their system is-- There is a premise flaw there. And that premise flaw is that you have told us that you don't earn the credit until the end of the year. So your answer about this probation is not an answer, because it's -- your premise is not the same. I'm not worried about sentences that are more than 2 years. I'm worried about the prisoner who is sentenced to a year and a day. How does that proration help that individual, since they are not going to get the good time credit until they've served a year? Counsel, I-- --That's what I'm saying to you. The whole brief says to us, they measure the entitlement to good time credit at the end of the first year. He is not going to get 54 days? He's going to get-- --I just want to make absolutely sure because I hadn't done the math forward; I did the math backwards. Which was the one that Justice Breyer and Justice Alito set forth-- --Which is 54 days are earned back for each year, and you take it off the full term of imprisonment. The -- you are representing to me that the math that is in your program statement is accomplishing that result? Counsel, this explanation that has been given in your brief and the one you are giving to us now as to why BOP chose what it did, is there any statement outside of the penned affidavit that explains why this choice was made? But in each one of them they have taken the position that the statute was unambiguous. Assuming that that is not accepted by us, that it's ambiguous, what and where are we giving Chevron or Skidmore deference to what set of facts or to what-- --Well, did they exercise discretion when they took the position that it was unambiguous? We have never given deference, have we, to an affidavit submitted in litigation to explain something that on its face is not explained either in an agency's regulation or in its policy statement that -- that -- this is giving deference to an affidavit. Just so -- in your system they do the measurement at the end of the 365 days. He misbehaves on the 340th day. And they say for that reason, I'm only going to give you 10 days of full time -- of good time credit. So now your year starts at 350? No, they said they are only giving you 10 days of good time credit. Because at the end of -- 355. That was pretty bad. [Laughter] 355.

2009,Merck & Co. v. Reynolds,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counselor, that presumes that then Congress is using unnecessary words when it differentiates in a statute between discovery of facts constituting a violation and a different statute, like section 13 or 77m, however you want to call it, when it says ""due diligence"". So are we supposed to presume that they like using unnecessary words? So you're answering me yes, it's unnecessary. Can you tell me-- --Can you tell me what that investigation would entail? Meaning, you started by saying, go talk to experts, but I'm not sure what talking to experts would have added to the market mix of information. You either pick one expert who said the theory was sound or one who didn't. Outside of publicly available information, what -- and finding it -- what other inquiry could they have made that would have led them to discover sufficient information to file a lawsuit? Assuming they had talked to those lawyers, is there anything to suggest that those lawyers had more information than the ones they included in the publicly available lawsuit? You haven't answered my question. Is there some information in some publicly filed lawsuit up until the time of the filing of this lawsuit that disclosed more information about scienter than existed? Could you -- could you tell me what the difference is between actual knowledge and constructive knowledge? Because as I read the amici who have submitted briefs arguing that actual discovery should be our standard, they appear to say that actual discovery or actual knowledge includes anything that's in the public domain; that parties are presumed -- and we have plenty of cases that say that -- to know what's out there. So outside of that, how would constructive knowledge or constructive discovery be any different? It would require the shareholder to find the guy in Burma? Or to go and attempt in every case to engage employees in dishonorable conduct by talking about their business in private, company business -- as I understood it, we were asking employees to engage in potentially fiduciary breaches? Well, that's going further than the amici are suggesting. The amici are suggesting -- and assuming we accept their suggestion -- that it should be everything that's in the public domain, which seems reasonable to me. What, in addition, do you think constructive knowledge would include that the actual knowledge standard doesn't? Putting all of that-- --what in addition to that would it include, in your mind? So -- so you are conceding amici's point that actual -- an actual knowledge standard is the same as a constructive knowledge standard? Can -- can you tell me what you see as the difference between the two? I keep going back to what the amici has argued, which is actual knowledge that includes knowledge of what's in the public domain, under the theory that every shareholder is presumed to know what's in the public domain because that's what they buy with and that's the market theory of securities law. So, what do you see as a difference between the two? But I -- it sounds right, but give me a practical -- give me a practical example-- --of what you are talking about, where -- where an individual investor would have something that's not in the public domain. Well -- but actual knowledge would include anything the investor had in their possession because that's what actual knowledge is; I have it in my possession -- or I have it in the public domain. You start it from there. The -- the only difference then would be information the individual would have been able to get that wouldn't have been in the public domain? I -- so we are in agreement that on a fraud-on-the-market case, it might have a different -- they would be identical? You are suggesting that, in an individual fraud case, the inquiry has to be constructive knowledge because there could be things that-- --So you are admitting that you filed an improper complaint, that you didn't have a basis -- a good faith basis for the complaint you filed? So, if you had a good faith basis, what was -- what was in your possession that gave you that good faith basis? Counsel, I -- whether it's a legal nullity or not, answer my question which is: You had to have a basis for your complaint. What was in your possession or in the public possession that gave you that basis? Well, you think there was, because you filed suit a month after that study in 2003.

I'm sorry. You have 120 days to amend, don't you, from the filing of the complaint? Right. Complaint. So why can't Costa Cruise be perceived to hold one of those roles? That's not what the rule says. The rule doesn't talk about what kind of mistake or why. The rule says what the defendant should have known. And so, when you read this complaint, it's very clear you know you're the carrier. You know cruise -- the other line, the sales agent, can't be the carrier, correct? So it's either a factual or a legal mistake. There is no other way to read that other than that there is a mistake. Because -- then have you to answer Justice Breyer's question, which is: What conceivable reason that is not either negligence or unintentional or inadvertent or just plain stupidity, however you want to define it, that someone who is injured would want to name a party who wasn't responsible for the injury? But, counsel, don't -- what you're really talking about is whether once the answer was filed, they were dilatory in making their motion. I don't understand how you can argue that the day you received this complaint, you didn't understand that some sort of mistake had been made. The day that the answer came in, you might start to have a doubt because of their delay in the motion to amend, but doesn't that go to a 15(a) question, whether the judge should have given leave to amend because of dilatory tactics? Isn't that a 15(a) question, not a 15(c) question? Is there anything in the face of the complaint that would suggest anything but a mistake? Now, forget -- I'm being very specific. On the face of the complaint. You read that. Where does it say that? Where does it say: ""I know that the carrier is Costa Crociere? "" What the complaint says is that Costa Cruise, the operator of the vessel, injured me, correct? And is that an accurate statement of fact? So-- ",counsel assume i accept your argument and i be the cruise operator the cruise owner cruise ship owner and i look at the complaint and i say i think they really mean me but i think now within the m period which be the period in which i be suppose to reasonably know that i would have be name absent a mistake here an answer be file and you be tell there be a mistake and you do not correct the mistake what conclusion would a reasonable person at that second juncture make about whether you make a mistake or not and i think that be what the issue be here which be assume the complaint could be read as a mistake during the m period be not that mistake correct and you refuse or fail to act that make so little sense to me here i think and for the following reason you seriously i do not think could contend that if you have seek to amend a year later that that would have be timely correct all right but put aside prejudice what the low court say be because your delay speak to a choice that that be the only thing a reasonable defendant would have assume that have be tell that you sue the wrong party and you continue in that action that that be what you intend to do to sue that wrong party I be sorry you have day to amend do not you from the filing of the complaint right complaint so why can not costa cruise be perceive to hold one of those role that be not what the rule say the rule do not talk about what kind of mistake or why the rule say what the defendant should have know and so when you read this complaint it be very clear you know you be the carrier you know cruise the other line the sale agent can not be the carrier correct so it be either a factual or a legal mistake there be no other way to read that other than that there be a mistake because then have you to answer justice breyer s question which be what conceivable reason that be not either negligence or unintentional or inadvertent or just plain stupidity however you want to define it that someone who be injure would want to name a party who be not responsible for the injury but counsel do not what you be really talk about be whether once the answer be file they we be dilatory in make their motion i do not understand how you can argue that the day you receive this complaint you do not understand that some sort of mistake have be make the day that the answer come in you might start to have a doubt because of their delay in the motion to amend but do not that go to a a question whether the judge should have give leave to amend because of dilatory tactic be not that a a question not a c question be there anything in the face of the complaint that would suggest anything but a mistake now forget I be be very specific on the face of the complaint you read that where do it say that where do it say i know that the carrier be costa crociere what the complaint say be that costa cruise the operator of the vessel injure me correct and be that an accurate statement of fact so ,257.22,Roberts Court,"Apr 21, 2010",Wanda Krupski,"Costa Crociere, S.p.A.",09-337,"Jan 15, 2010","Jun 7, 2010",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2009,Salazar v. Buono,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I don't understand -- I don't understand that point at all. If you thought that he didn't have standing to challenge the cross at all and that the injunction itself directing you to cover up the cross was wrong, you should have come to the Court. It was a permanent injunction. You were told you have interlocutory appeal rights, you have final judgment rights. At any point you could have come and said: The order for us to take that flag -- to take that cross off this land was just plain wrong. But interlocutory appeal or finality doesn't matter what you are going to do to get away from the injunction. The issue is did you give up any rights to challenge any of the issues embodied in that injunction and you haven't answered why not. You may have a right, and you do, to challenge a modification of that injunction. That's what you are here to do, to say the Ninth Circuit erred in modifying the injunction and stopping the transfer. Perfectly legitimate point, because the injunction has been changed. But you can't go back and relitigate whether he had standing to challenge that -- the presence of that cross. Isn't there legislation that requires the original plaque to be reinstated, the plaque recognizing the donation and what it means? This would be on government land, that sign? It wouldn't be on the acre that you transferred. I'm a little confused. You are talking about putting-- --Would go on the cross? The larger sign you're talking about that you are willing to do is a sign that you would put on government land. Did you raise that alternative with the Ninth -- with the district court and the Ninth Circuit? Can -- can -- what, what -- let's start from the beginning. Can -- would it be proper for the government or would the government be alleged to have violated the Establishment Clause if on another ranch that cross -- a cross went up? All right. So really your argument is that the reason this Court -- this cross on private land, if it becomes private, is offensive to the Establishment Clause is because of the government's prior history with respect to that cross, correct? That's -- that's your argument? So are you alleging that doing that violates the Establishment Clause, passing or designating a religious symbol as a national memorial, that that violates the Establishment Clause? Does that apply to all lands in this preserve? Does the reversionary interest apply to all of lands on this preserve? Maybe your adversary has to answer that instead of you, but all of the other private property owners. No, no, no. Are all of the private owners on this preserve required to give the land back to the U.S. if they put it to some different use?

2009,Berghuis v. Thompkins,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Could you tell me without more detail, which is what the circuit court said, about what the limited responses -- I'm using your word -- were. How do we -- how can we imply waiver? Meaning if all he said was, yes, I want them in, that's much different than saying, if someone had asked him, do you want to leave, and he shakes his head no. The latter might imply to me that he waived, but the former certainly would be neutral. So what do we do with our case law that says that you can't infer waiver simply from the confession? I mean, we have said that. So that's pretty clearly established statement-- --by the Court. Well, I think certainly in -- in Butler, if someone in their confession says, I know I don't have to talk to you, but I want to, that that would be using those words. So how can you say-- --How can you say that an appeal to someone's religious position after 2 and a quarter hours is a voluntary waiver? You want to change the Miranda rule to say: Tell someone their rights, and unless they explicitly say ""I don't want to talk to you. "" then they implicitly under virtually any circumstance haven't. That's what you believe the rule in Miranda and Butler and Davis sets forth? There wasn't -- there wasn't silence in Butler. There was an express ""I want to talk to you. "" My -- but we go back to the point you made earlier. Your position is the moment that someone confesses, that's an implicit waiver. Excuse me. As I read this transcript, the police's tactic, by their own statement, was to approach him and say: This is our evidence. Explain yourself -- that's the words the officer used -- but he's entitled to an alternative explanation. Tell us. What's clear is that at no point did he answer those questions, because nothing about the nods of the head or anything else showed a willingness to confess. And even in the responses he gave, he answered a series of questions with a ""yes"", but not with an explanation, which was what was being requested. So my question is, how does one infer a voluntary statement from a situation in which someone's really not talking? I've never understood how a yes or a nod to questions that don't -- that's what the circuit said, to questions that we don't know what they were about -- do you want a mint or not, I don't even know that -- can reflect voluntariness? And I understand that in Butler when someone says I don't want to sign that, but I'm going to spill my guts now, and does, that's a course of conduct one could view as voluntary. Could you tell me when the police have to stop? They read somebody their rights; the person says nothing. Are you saying at that point they have to stop?

2009,Graham County Soil and Water Conservation District v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"How will that happen? Meaning, how will they know, A, that the investigation is occurring; and second, what can they do under Federal or State law to require the disclose of ongoing investigative materials? I don't know -- mind you, I haven't studied them -- but the ones that I am familiar with never permit the public -- none of the Freedom of Information Act-type legislation, never permit the disclosure of ongoing investigative material. So I am a little bit confused by how that would happen. But Congress obviously wanted more than that, because if Congress's intent was the one that you are announcing then it should have just permitted original sources to sue. But that's not the choice it made. It broadened the scope of qui tam actions to include more sources or more reward for individuals who don't have original information. But why can't it -- why can't it protect itself if these reports are in its possession? How are they any more in the -- or less in the government's possession than articles in the news media, than State, criminal, civil, and administrative hearings? You, yourself, make it very clear that the government -- it isn't keeping track of all of those other sources. Isn't that argument suggesting that the court didn't even need to reach this issue, even assuming that the State administrative reports are included in the bar? Well, aren't you arguing that what was in this audit report wasn't sufficient to show the fraud? That's not your argument? In which way? Which way?

2009,Dolan v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Excuse me. Is your argument that if the district court -- for whatever reason, unlikely as it may be -- starts a hearing the day after the rest of the sentence was imposed and has to continue that hearing for 91 days before it can render a judgment-- --that it's now barred from entering that judgment? I -- I'm not sure I understood your response to my question. It must impose that restitution order, complete all its proceedings within the 90-day period? So it can't hold a hearing over from the 90th day to the 91st day? Is there any circuit court who has addressed this issue of when an appeal is timely, in a situation in which a restitution order has not been entered at the initial sentencing? Under your view of things, however, that's fortuity that the underlying conviction was still in the appeal process, because there is no statute of limitations under your reading. A victim could come 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, or 100 years later and say: I'm entitled to restitution. And absent prejudice to the defendant, that would be okay? I'm sorry, that's 60 days after the restitution order has been issued. Am I-- --That 60 days says after there has been an -- a restitution order. I'm positing the situation where the victim comes 10 years later. That says there's no restitution order. It's the initial action. And you're saying that's okay? It's an endless statute? Except that that was a bail question, where there's not issues of finality at play, and bail is a question that repeats itself throughout the proceedings. Defendants are denied bail and then make a different showing of either resources or less danger or whatever, and they get out. And vice versa, defendants are out and are put in. That's it. There are no finality questions there. What do you do in this situation when you're dealing with a criminal sentence where there are finality rules? And I'm going to tie that back to my starting point, which is I'm looking in your brief for the precedent and/or legal basis for us to treat restitution as not part of the final judgment in this criminal action. What -- what other examples do we have in the criminal context? They couldn't do that until the end of the 90 days. If the judge has 90 days to order restitution, that's a vicious cycle argument.

2009,Florida v. Powell,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"One of your amici -- one of the amici suggested that the Florida courts cannot read the Florida Constitution more expansively than the Federal requirements. Are you rejecting that proposition? And it's a different question. One of the amici suggests that the Florida Constitution and Florida case law says that they can't read the Florida Constitution more broadly than it is read under Federal law. So this could be a first, if we were to start from the proposition that Justice Ginsburg did? Do -- do you see a conflict between the language of our decisions where we often say that Miranda rights have to be clear and those decisions that say that whatever is said has to reasonably convey the essence of the Miranda warnings? Is there a difference between those two statements, and which of our cases or statements would control? So you would suggest that if something is not clear and it's ambiguous, that that's enough? Or -- or is there a difference between reasonable and clarity? That has to be read in a certain way; otherwise an ambiguous warning-- --I have a difficulty in terms of this argument about burdening law enforcement. This is a preprinted form that the police made up, correct? So what's the added burden by making the form absolutely and abundantly clear or conforming the form to the statements in Miranda? What's the cost to the State? They're going to print the form anyway. They are telling their officers to read from the form anyway. What's the added cost? Well, there is a question about how much the subjective intent of the questioner should be involved in this process or not. There are cases where it appears the plurality of our Court has said it should always be an objective standard, and others where certain members have expressed a question about subjective. But if we are dealing with a printed form, why wouldn't the intent of the entity at issue be placed in question? Meaning, you could have -- the police here could have chosen to be explicit, but instead they chose to be -- to obfuscate a little bit and be less explicit. Shouldn't we assume that that's an intent to deceive or perhaps to confuse? But why? The -- the easy solution is to do what 90 percent of the jurisdictions are doing: Copy Miranda. Except that Justice Scalia just pointed out, if we approve the language of this, then -- of this particular warning, it becomes the new sort of floor. And if we make it the new floor, it -- doesn't it provide an incentive for police departments to move away from the explicit warnings that say ""during and"" -- ""before and during"" interrogations; now we're saying -- you know, generalize them more. Aren't we encouraging that? How many after Duckworth? Do you know? So we don't know how many-- --What -- how do we deal with the fact that, if the purpose of Miranda is to give clear warnings, and your adversary says -- not your adversary -- your co-counsel -- Petitioner's counsel says that means -- ""clear"" means does it reasonably convey? We've got a split of circuit courts and State courts on whether this reasonably conveys or not. Shouldn't that be enough of an ambiguity for us to conclude it can't reasonably convey, if there's this many courts holding that it doesn't? Are you calling the Florida State Supreme Court majority unreasonable jurists? What happens now is that we are dealing with the exception rather than the rule, and -- but this was the rule, meaning this was the form that they were reading. And if it has some significant ambiguity in it, sufficient for at least one court to say it wasn't sufficiently clear, it wasn't explicit enough, should we worry about the exception as an exception? Just so I get the bottom line -- if all this warning had said was, you have a right to a lawyer before questioning-- --You have a right to a lawyer before questioning-- --it would be your position that standing alone that would be enough? The bottom line in my mind -- the question is, whether these warnings are substantively or otherwise different than the FBI warnings that some believe were approved in Miranda. Are these equivalent? I don't disagree with you, but that wasn't my question. My question was, did the FBI warning at issue or-- --Not at issue because it wasn't at issue.

2009,United Student Aid Funds Inc. v. Espinosa,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"It was wrong. Let's assume-- --the circuit -- the district court judge, the bankruptcy court judge, got it wrong, legal error. Should not have been discharged, a given. Neither -- the confirmation plan should not have been approved, neither should the discharge order have been entered. We will go back to what was entered and -- and -- and the effect of that, because I'm not sure of it -- it's an error. How does that give you a right to undo that judgment 7 years later -- was it 5, 6, 7 years later? That's the question here. Why is something that's in error become a void judgment? But so does -- most error committed by courts, inadvertently or otherwise, are in contravention of some statutory command. This is no different. Voidness, as I've heard it described by many others, appears to mean that the court is acting either without jurisdiction over the people, and that's not at issue here -- there was jurisdiction over the parties here -- or without jurisdiction over the res. But the bankruptcy court does have jurisdiction, albeit in some -- in all circumstances, it had jurisdiction over the student debt. The issue is what could it do with it. But this is not a case involving a lack of jurisdiction by the court over property. So why is this more than mere error? But that -- that goes back to something more fundamental. There's no issue here that the court had jurisdiction over these parties, unlike the insurance company. And there's no issue that the court didn't have jurisdiction over this res. They could decide that a student loan was dischargeable. They just had to follow certain procedures. It's a very different set of circumstances in that case. So it's not -- it's not that it is not dischargeable. It's only dischargeable under certain conditions. All right. So -- so you're almost begging the question, because it's possible to argue that if a debt is not dischargeable at all under any circumstance, your argument might have more legs because then the court has no jurisdiction over that property. But that's not the case with these exceptions. They can all be discharged. It's just a matter of whether the conditions have been met or not. Could I-- --Counsel-- --Counsel, may I interrupt for just one moment, because I -- there is something niggling at me that I do need an answer to before you sit down-- --I'm sorry. Counsel, if they had come to the court at the time the discharge order was about to be entered and said we object, there has been no undue hardship found, would the court have been obligated to alter the plan at that point? The confirmed plan proposed a discharge, but at the time that the discharge order was being entered, there's an objection. What would have happened? So that's the question. What's final? Is it the plan that's final or is it the discharge order that's final? Well, but -- but here we have a discharge order that on its face appeared to be proper. It excepted out the student loan from the discharge. And your other -- the other side has sort of given up on that as a-- --as a point, because that, interestingly enough to me, would have been the stronger due process argument, whether the Ninth Circuit and the district court could have amended that discharge order illegally to except something it didn't except, that was -- shouldn't have been excepted to start with. But that argument seems to have been put aside. But -- so, it might have been the stronger due process argument. But having put that aside, then your belief is that there is no point in time between the confirmation in the plan and the discharge order in which a party can object for -- to an error-- --except as permitted by 60(b) and 1330? Which order could they have -- they could not have appealed-- --They could not have appealed the discharge order? Well, going back to Justice Kennedy's point, I mean, some people are listed in discharge orders that were never discussed in the plan, or otherwise some people are excluded that should have been included. Those people can't appeal? Could you go back to the fundamental part of my question to your adversary? The plan order included a discharge of the student interest -- of the interest on the student loan. It just proposed a discharge of a certain amount lesser than the principal plus interest. Right. That's the plan. And then you have a discharge order. And the two are not congruent. So what's the final judgment? No, no. Is it the confirmation order or is it the discharge order? Are they different judgments? What -- what controls? And what were you-- ",it be wrong let us assume the circuit the district court judge the bankruptcy court judge get it wrong legal error should not have be discharge a give neither the confirmation plan should not have be approve neither should the discharge order have be enter we will go back to what be enter and and and the effect of that because I be not sure of it it be an error how do that give you a right to undo that judgment year later be it year later that be the question here why be something that be in error become a void judgment but so do most error commit by court inadvertently or otherwise be in contravention of some statutory command this be no different voidness as I have hear it describe by many others appear to mean that the court be act either without jurisdiction over the people and that be not at issue here there be jurisdiction over the party here or without jurisdiction over the re but the bankruptcy court do have jurisdiction albeit in some in all circumstance it have jurisdiction over the student debt the issue be what could it do with it but this be not a case involve a lack of jurisdiction by the court over property so why be this more than mere error but that that go back to something more fundamental there be no issue here that the court have jurisdiction over these party unlike the insurance company and there be no issue that the court do not have jurisdiction over this re they could decide that a student loan be dischargeable they just have to follow certain procedure it be a very different set of circumstance in that case so it be not it be not that it be not dischargeable it be only dischargeable under certain condition all right so so you be almost beg the question because it be possible to argue that if a debt be not dischargeable at all under any circumstance your argument might have more leg because then the court have no jurisdiction over that property but that be not the case with these exception they can all be discharge it be just a matter of whether the condition have be meet or not could i counsel counsel may i interrupt for just one moment because i there be something niggle at me that i do need an answer to before you sit down I be sorry counsel if they have come to the court at the time the discharge order be about to be enter and say we object there have be no undue hardship find would the court have be obligate to alter the plan at that point the confirmed plan propose a discharge but at the time that the discharge order be be enter there be an objection what would have happen so that be the question what be final be it the plan that be final or be it the discharge order that be final well but but here we have a discharge order that on its face appear to be proper it except out the student loan from the discharge and your other the other side have sort of give up on that as a as a point because that interestingly enough to me would have be the strong due process argument whether the ninth circuit and the district court could have amend that discharge order illegally to except something it do not except that be should not have be except to start with but that argument seem to have be put aside but so it might have be the strong due process argument but have put that aside then your belief be that there be no point in time between the confirmation in the plan and the discharge order in which a party can object for to an error except as permit by b and which order could they have they could not have appeal they could not have appeal the discharge order well go back to justice kennedy s point i mean some people be list in discharge order that we be never discuss in the plan or otherwise some people be exclude that should have be include those people can not appeal could you go back to the fundamental part of my question to your adversary the plan order include a discharge of the student interest of the interest on the student loan it just propose a discharge of a certain amount less than the principal plus interest right that be the plan and then you have a discharge order and the two be not congruent so what be the final judgment no no be it the confirmation order or be it the discharge order be they different judgment what what control and what we be you ,310.01,Roberts Court,"Dec 1, 2009",United Student Aid Funds Inc.,Francisco J.

2009,Granite Rock Co. v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"You are not arguing us creating Federal common law for tortious interference. You are saying they're the actual party to the contract. So which theory are you -- are you arguing? So you've given up the agency argument? How is that issue still alive? Wasn't there an NLRB order in May of '06 that said -- or directed that the contract become effective as of July 2nd? Did anybody appeal that order or challenge it? So did -- but how -- if you lost in your appeal to the Ninth Circuit and the contract is effective July 2nd, what issue remains for anybody to decide with respect to contract formation? Because there has been a final adjudication of the question of the effective date of the contract. So now the only question that appears to be extant in my mind is whether or not there was a breach of the no-strike clause. So why isn't that subject to arbitration by the very terms of the arbitration clause? But I keep going back to: That issue was decided. It was decided by the NLRB, and that was affirmed by a court of law, and so -- by the Ninth Circuit. I don't understand what the extant issue is. The -- the -- now what's left is applying that in arbitration to the question of the effectiveness of the no-strike clause. But it has nothing to do with whether or not the issue of ratification has been decided and by whom. I thought you answered Justice Alito ""no"", but I thought his question was a very simple one. You're taking the position, I think, that there's no dispute that on -- in December a contract was formed. It was made retroactive to a date before July. It started in May-- --and it covers a time frame. The dispute between the parties is what that retroactivity under the contract means and which provisions are in effect or not. Isn't that what your argument is -- that this is not contract formation; this is a question of -- of the applicability of individual provisions to a set of facts? So your answer to Justice Alito should have been: We are arguing that the no-strike clause was not in effect, but we do take the position that the arbitration clause was-- --made retroactive. What remedies -- I'm sorry. Do you seriously think that if that becomes a problem, that the NLRB won't declare it an unfair labor practice, or if they don't, that they won't go to Congress and say: There is a no-man's land; now give a remedy like you did in 301? You're -- you're begging Justice Breyer's question, which is: If the law pre-empts this claim and it's doing so unjustly, who should make that determination? Should it be you in a State court, you in a Federal court, or should it be in the first instance the NLRB who says this is or isn't an unfair labor practice, and if it rules it's not because the law doesn't cover it, or it's not authorized to issue this-- ",you be not argue us create federal common law for tortious interference you be say they be the actual party to the contract so which theory be you be you argue so you have give up the agency argument how be that issue still alive be not there an nlrb order in may of that say or direct that the contract become effective as of july nd do anybody appeal that order or challenge it so do but how if you lose in your appeal to the ninth circuit and the contract be effective july nd what issue remain for anybody to decide with respect to contract formation because there have be a final adjudication of the question of the effective date of the contract so now the only question that appear to be extant in my mind be whether or not there be a breach of the no strike clause so why be not that subject to arbitration by the very term of the arbitration clause but i keep go back to that issue be decide it be decide by the nlrb and that be affirm by a court of law and so by the ninth circuit i do not understand what the extant issue be the the now what be leave be apply that in arbitration to the question of the effectiveness of the no strike clause but it have nothing to do with whether or not the issue of ratification have be decide and by whom i think you answered justice alito no but i think his question be a very simple one you be take the position i think that there be no dispute that on in december a contract be form it be make retroactive to a date before july it start in may and it cover a time frame the dispute between the party be what that retroactivity under the contract mean and which provision be in effect or not be not that what your argument be that this be not contract formation this be a question of of the applicability of individual provision to a set of fact so your answer to justice alito should have be we be argue that the no strike clause be not in effect but we do take the position that the arbitration clause be make retroactive what remedy I be sorry do you seriously think that if that become a problem that the nlrb will not declare it an unfair labor practice or if they do not that they will not go to congress and say there be a no man s land now give a remedy like you do in you be you be beg justice breyer s question which be if the law pre empts this claim and it be do so unjustly who should make that determination should it be you in a state court you in a federal court or should it be in the first instance the nlrb who say this be or be not an unfair labor practice and if it rule it be not because the law do not cover it or it be not authorize to issue this ,230.36000000000004,Roberts Court,"Jan 19, 2010",Granite Rock Co.,International Brotherhood of Teamsters et al.,08-1214,"Jun 29, 2009","Jun 24, 2010",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2009,Hui v. Castaneda,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, our job is to determine Congress's intent when it passed 233(a).

So we really don't have anything to tell us, because they didn't even know that there was a constitutional claim that could be raised, what they would have intended or not intended. And I thought that Justice Ginsburg's point would be that the Westfall Act tells us what they intended, because by its nature it applied to all employees and didn't differentiate among them, and copied 233's immunity, so that one can look at it and say, ah, that speaks of Congress's intent.

2009,Perdue v. Kenny A.,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I'm sorry. Could you repeat what the market was? Was it the market for all attorneys or only for attorneys doing this type of work? How about you get a second-year associate whose billing rate for 2 years of experience is $200, and a partner's rate is $500, and a judge says: This individual didn't perform like a 2-year associate; he did the quality and kind of work of someone far superior in years in skill and experience. That would not, under your argument, entitle the court to give an enhancement? But you haven't dealt with my hypothetical. He didn't perform like a second-year associate. He performed like a 15-year lawyer. The difference is not with respect to skill and experience. It's with respect to performance. And so what Justice Ginsburg was asking is, what you are basically saying, the quality of that representation, even though it reflected more than the market one would look at objectively on the basis of the years of experience, that judge can't enhance, even though someone performed far above whatever else the market would consider his or her skills at the moment. That's not true. Law firms get bonuses from clients all the time. They get negotiated. Some of the amici gave examples of what's happening in the -- what happens in the marketplace. So why can't the judge determine a reasonable fee in the same way the market does? Which is-- --No, but the -- but the Congress didn't use the per-hour lodestar-- --as the method. If that's all it wanted, it could have, and there were suggestions that it consider limiting the -- the award to just a lodestar calculation. So obviously Congress was thinking of something broader than just that. That part of the market anyway. Well, but that's why we have held in our cases that it should be a rare and exceptional circumstance. The difference that we are engaged in is whether the quality of performance can ever constitute that rare exception that would justify a district court saying, you performed greater than what the market would have valued you at before your performance. That's really what the issue is. One of the purposes of Congress -- one of the purposes of Congress was to ensure that litigants under these fee-shifting statutes could attract competent counsel, correct? If the market doesn't give them attorneys to start with because there are so many risks involved in this process and it sets a reduced fee because of those risks, how do you attract competent counsel? How do you attract counsel that is better than the norm in that field to pursue as private attorney generals cases that Congress has determined are worthy of being pursued, unless you have a quality adjustment factor? That doesn't mean Dague was right, right? No one is arguing a different point? Aren't you -- most of your arguments are suggesting that the counter -- that your adversary is now limiting, that the adjustment should be made -- tied to something, and that something would be the actual rate. And most of the factors you are talking about -- whether the person's a national attorney with overhead or whether that person's a -- has done better work -- the example I used, a second-year associate, could be adjusted just in the rate, and that would give you a grounded place to make a judgment about the exercise of a court's discretion.

2009,Alvarez v. Smith,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Is there any other area -- is there any other area of law where we permit a prejudgment attachment and/or seizure of property without a neutral magistrate reviewing the reason for that seizure? We don't permit a pretrial attachment, do we, except in some narrow circumstances? But that's-- --I don't deny that there's a State interest. The question is who tests that interest? In what time frame? Meaning you can assert an interest, but someone has to determine whether it really exists or not. So am I forgetting, but didn't this start out as a class action and wasn't the claim -- wasn't the class action denied? And you didn't appeal that? What did the Illinois court do? Didn't it remand for an appropriate hearing to be given? I'm sorry. You take the car and then you investigate? But -- but you are -- but you're sort of begging the question. You are saying to me that initial period is for the government to figure out if it made a mistake or not, and we're entitled to that time. You're not entitled, meaning you, property owner, to go to a neutral magistrate who will make that decision without a personal interest in the outcome, because the person who seized does have an interest of some sort. Many local police departments do in seizing property, because they keep the proceeds. So what you're saying is that constitutionally it's okay for the party holding on to property without a warrant to decide whether or not it wants to give something back, whether or not there's -- there's a viable defense. I'm a little confused. No, it wasn't. The appeal in Geraghty included an appeal of the denial of class certification. So both issues -- both the merits and the denial of the class certification -- were still active before the Court. Here you didn't appeal the dismissal of the class certification or the mootness of it. But -- but in many appeals parties plead in the alternative and say, if you -- if we win on the merits, reverse the dismissal of the class certification because we still want to proceed as a class. You didn't do that. You waited for the merits to be adjudicated and then filed a new class action. It's a very different procedural step. Counsel, can you unpackage for me this hearing? Because there is a confusion in it that appears, both in your papers and in this argument. There's a probable cause component, which is the police coming before a neutral magistrate and saying, this is the reason I seized; I have probable cause to believe that this car was involved in an illegal activity, and this is why. And then there is what sounds like, to me, a sort of remission-type component to the hearing you are looking at, which is a magistrate saying, okay, you have probable cause, but there's no reason for the seizing authorities to keep the car because you can post a bond instead, or something else should be done to mitigate the damage to you during this process of forfeiture. Am I correct that there are two components to your request? And if there are, I understand the probable cause component, but I'm not sure how you get to the second component of how and why due process would require the State to have a -- I'm calling it remission -- but a remission-like proceeding? Am I correct? Am I understanding what -- what it is you're-- Can I just get clarification? Under your State law, there is no way for an owner to come in and challenge probable cause to seize? Not a defense-- --but the examples Judge Breyer said: My car was just sitting there. All right. And, second, is there any procedure under your State law to do the second half of what your adversary said he was looking for, a remission-type proceeding that would balance the government's need to hold the property and the individual's need for it, and whether there is a bond that could be posted or not? Well, that may be part of the Mathews issue, that once you prove probable cause, giving away -- giving back money just never would probably be rational to hold a hearing about, but that might not be true for real property, correct? Under -- even under Mathews, under -- in a Mathews analysis. If you apply a Mathews analysis-- --the multifaceted item would say for the seizure of cash, maybe only the hearing has to address probable cause, but for real property it has to go further. Not real property, in the sense of real personal property.

But what-- --The problem with your argument is this pot of money is actually not going to -- it's going to the debtor, according to your argument, because in theory the debtor is the prevailing party and is entitled to get the award. But the money is not being paid to the debtor. It's for the benefit of the lawyer who has done the work that Congress wanted done. I don't know what the -- I don't know what the motivation would be for a lawyer to undertake to represent the meritorious claim when they have to not only do the work in the case, but now have to do the work for the government in getting their client to negotiate an agreement with the government on something that's completely unrelated to the claim. It's -- it's sort of-- --illogical. Is it-- --Just so I'm clarifying, is it your position -- and this is something I want to ask the government as well -- that once the EAJA fee is awarded, the attorney couldn't sue the client later even in an offset situation for repayment, because by statute you view them as blocked from-- --from seeking anything other than the EAJA fee or the 406 fee? So that once the offset happens, the attorney, under -- even if the client had other money, the attorney would be blocked from going after it?

2009,Union Pacific R. Co. v. Locomotive Engineers,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, the circuit court did things in an unusual order. Instead of reaching the statutory question, it reached the constitutional question, in par, because it viewed the two as intertwined. Why isn't its judgment that there's a statutory violation what's at issue before us, because that's what they said? Why not? No. It's an award that is contrary to the act. That's the-- --Well, I saw it in their brief to the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit analyzed the requirements of the act and of circular one and said the board's ruling is not based on those. That's true generally, but if the board believes that as a matter of law it can't hear this dispute and consider normal grounds for excusing a failure to include something in the record because, in its own language, we can't do it, the law doesn't permit us to do it, we have no jurisdiction to consider matters outside the record, we don't apply normal rules of waiver or forfeiture or any of the other rules that attend themselves to a failure of a party to immediately raise a defense like you could have done and waited two and a half years to do, doesn't that suggest that the board is not reaching -- merely resting its decision on a merely procedural rule, it's resting its decision on its erroneous view that the law deprives it of jurisdiction to hear the case? No, but that -- this is not merely a question of law. This is a question of jurisdiction: Is it entitled to hear a dispute by law? Don't you think there is a big difference between the adjudicator saying: I could, but I choose not to because there is no reason for your failure, from: I won't because I can't. Those are -- those are two very different concepts. Can -- can we -- I'm sorry. Let's assume that in a published opinion there are two procedural defaults. One, the union does; the other, the railroad does. The board says, you know, I am resolving this dispute. I'm not forgiving the union's procedural default, but I will forgive the railroad's procedural default, because they're an important lifeline business for America and we've got to make sure that they're protected at all costs, and union members are just not important enough to that scheme. In your theory, there is no due process violation in that case? They have heard the arguments, they have given you a full opportunity to make your point about the procedural default. They are announcing a new rule. It's okay. So what's wrong with that? Under what theory? Why? Well, point me to any rule, that -- you know, anybody could point to a rule and says it commands a result. They -- there are rules here that say disputes should be submitted to the board and resolved. And they are resolving the dispute, the dispute, and they are saying, you have defaulted, you didn't. But they can do that. That's what -- that's what the circuit said. They could have passed a rule that told people, warned them, and said this is a procedural rule we are going to apply. At what point does the interpretation of rules that don't command a result become improper, outside the board's jurisdiction? According to you, never. But there is a difference between governmentally ordered arbitrations and private contracts. In private contracts the parties negotiate the rules and they set them forth, and the arbitrators then follow-- --Is it your position that if you go through the first phase and as everybody is walking out the two adversaries in the first investigative space say this is never going to be settled, this is the most important case in the history of this -- the railroad system. Let's go take it to the board. That they can't waive the grievance procedure, that they just can't go straight to you? But we disagree with you. You say if the board was just plain wrong. If we look at the Act and circular one and say we can't find what they said anywhere in there, does that doom your argument?

2009,Renico v. Lett,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Excuse me. The content of the first note was a query of the court. And that query was: ""What happens if we can't reach a verdict? "" Isn't that substantially different? Doesn't that suggest that the jury is trying to figure out what are the consequences of its actions and whether reaching a consensus is possible? Excuse me. How long before that last note was that? Did anybody hear the voices? Could you tell me what facts found by the lower courts or the trial courts show that the Court acted, quote, and this is from our earlier Perez case, the very first in this area, ""deliberately, responsibly, and not precipitously. "" in declaring a mistrial. What in the facts you have recited-- --show that activity? What is the factual finding that you think we have to give deference to? I know the facts you've recited. There don't appear to be any of the facts with respect to what occurred during the activity. So what factual finding do we have to give deference to? But I'm not sure how that finding supports the finding, or a finding, that the Court was acting deliberately, responsibly, and not precipitously. Have you found any case where a judge has declared a mistrial without conferring with counsel, where the declaration was upheld? Well you can't read from that one, because in that one it was -- the mistrial was held, not because of a jury deadlock, but because of improper prejudicial actions during the trial. Those are different questions. Could you -- yes, but that doesn't mean none. What -- other than we have cases where judges have declared mistrials because they are going on vacation. Those are easy, okay? But somewhere the word ""abuse of discretion"" means that someone has discretion, but is improperly exercising it. What facts would it take for you to believe that that would have been the case? What do you have to take out of this case to say, ah, that was -- that would have been an abuse of discretion? What point? If he got the note and declared a mistrial, that would be enough, right? Or would it? Why isn't that this one, meaning the jury doesn't say, we are deadlocked, hopelessly deadlocked, we cannot reach a verdict. It asks: What happens if we don't? And the foreperson hasn't conferred with the jury to determine whether or not as a group they believe they are hopelessly deadlocked. Why isn't this precipitous action? You can't say, can you, that every time the jury records that it can't reach a verdict or it hasn't reached a unanimous verdict, that that's a legal deadlock requiring a mistrial, can you? So obviously the word ""deadlock"", and as I read the judge's questions, he defined it merely as a disagreement as to the verdict. And later he uses ""hopelessly deadlocked"", but changes the question when he asks the foreperson to respond. Isn't there a difference between hopelessly, i.e., no further deliberations is likely to reach a verdict, as opposed to you can't ever reach a verdict? Counsel, there is no case in our jurisprudence with identical or nearly identical facts, so this is not under the 24 -- of 2254(d)(1). So it has to be under the ""unreasonable application"". Particularly for me, what Supreme Court precedent do you think was unreasonably applied, and explain how and why? Are you suggesting that you need a precedent overruling a lower court decision before we could declare that something was unreasonable -- that our precedent was unreasonably applied? But that could also be consistent with the fact that Perez was clear enough that judges have to act slowly and -- and with thought, and that lower courts are catching those when they are not. I mean, I don't know how it cuts, is what I'm saying. ",excuse me the content of the first note be a query of the court and that query be what happen if we can not reach a verdict be not that substantially different do not that suggest that the jury be try to figure out what be the consequence of its action and whether reach a consensus be possible excuse me how long before that last note be that do anybody hear the voice could you tell me what facts find by the low court or the trial court show that the court act quote and this be from our early perez case the very first in this area deliberately responsibly and not precipitously in declare a mistrial what in the fact you have recite show that activity what be the factual finding that you think we have to give deference to i know the fact you have recite there do not appear to be any of the fact with respect to what occur during the activity so what factual finding do we have to give deference to but I be not sure how that finding support the finding or a finding that the court be act deliberately responsibly and not precipitously have you find any case where a judge have declare a mistrial without confer with counsel where the declaration be uphold well you can not read from that one because in that one it be the mistrial be hold not because of a jury deadlock but because of improper prejudicial action during the trial those be different question could you yes but that do not mean none what other than we have case where judge have declare mistrial because they be go on vacation those be easy okay but somewhere the word abuse of discretion mean that someone have discretion but be improperly exercise it what facts would it take for you to believe that that would have be the case what do you have to take out of this case to say ah that be that would have be an abuse of discretion what point if he get the note and declare a mistrial that would be enough right or would it why be not that this one mean the jury do not say we be deadlocked hopelessly deadlocked we can not reach a verdict it ask what happen if we do not and the foreperson have not confer with the jury to determine whether or not as a group they believe they be hopelessly deadlocked why be not this precipitous action you can not say can you that every time the jury record that it can not reach a verdict or it have not reach a unanimous verdict that that be a legal deadlock require a mistrial can you so obviously the word deadlock and as i read the judge s question he define it merely as a disagreement as to the verdict and later he use hopelessly deadlocked but change the question when he ask the foreperson to respond be not there a difference between hopelessly ie no further deliberation be likely to reach a verdict as oppose to you can not ever reach a verdict counsel there be no case in our jurisprudence with identical or nearly identical fact so this be not under the of d so it have to be under the unreasonable application particularly for me what supreme court precedent do you think be unreasonably apply and explain how and why be you suggest that you need a precedent overrule a low court decision before we could declare that something be unreasonable that our precedent be unreasonably apply but that could also be consistent with the fact that perez be clear enough that judge have to act slowly and and with thought and that low court be catch those when they be not i mean i do not know how it cut be what I be say ,266.71,Roberts Court,"Mar 29, 2010","Paul Renico, Warden",Reginald Lett,09-338,"Nov 30, 2009","May 3, 2010",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2009,"Milavetz, Gallop & Milavetz, P.A. v. United States",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Is there a -- is there a difference between unethical and illegal advice? As an attorney can you under -- give unethical advice? Under the State rules you can give unethical advice as a lawyer? So if you are not permitted to do so, what in the First Amendment would otherwise give you that right? I mean, this is a commercial transaction of sorts. It's a fiduciary duty, but it's a commercial transaction. They are coming to you and they are paying you for certain advice, so why would the person then protect your right to give unethical advice. We are assuming that it's not read with a limitation with respect to abusive conduct. Assuming that is read into the statute or is viewed as part of ""in contemplation of bankruptcy"", what in the First Amendment would make that be? Which doesn't explain why. You don't understand what it means as a lawyer? Before you go on on 528, could you clarify for me: What is your challenge to 528? Is it a normal-- --528. Is it a normal facial invalidity? Is it an overbreadth invalidity? Is it an as-applied challenge? What exactly are you claiming with respect to that-- --528. Yes. Can you tell me how you have an as-applied challenge when I don't even know what ad is at issue? I -- I have scoured the record for a handbill, meaning -- an advertisement-- --by you that I could look at and say, you know, I'm looking at it and it's not misleading. So where is it in the record? I -- I truly have never heard of an as-applied challenge when we don't know what it is being applied to. But putting that aside, so you have an as-applied challenge; do you have a facial challenge or an overbreadth challenge? Yes, the 528. Did the government bring this lawsuit below? So what, were they supposed to scour your advertisements to find the violation? Was that it? Could I ask you something? When you are an attorney advertising as an attorney who gives advice on bankruptcy, why aren't you a debt release -- relief advisor? That's -- that's the clear case. How about the person comes in, shows the attorney his or her financial state. There is no money to pay the fee. The attorney simply gives a bill and says, ""I need it by Friday"". No self-respecting person would believe that the individual is going to pay that bill without borrowing money from somewhere, if you have looked at their financial statement and there is no money to be had. Would the attorney have violated the statute there? Just one. So, basically, your bottom line is any advice to incur debt to pay an attorney is illegal? Perhaps I am being -- not quite understanding you. You are underscoring the more debt, that is going to always be additional, if the advice is to incur it. So what meaning are you giving to more that I am missing? How about a law firm that represents the biggest companies in the world? And so they are never going to consciously, intentionally seek out or represent a person defined with the financial limitations of this category. But it so happens that one of their very rich clients comes in and says, I have a small -- my brother-in-law is running a small business; help him or her. Is that firm in violation now because their advertisements did not include what 528(a) required? So they have to -- for this one brother-in-law, they have to amend -- they're now violated the statute ex post facto somehow?

2009,"NRG Power Marketing, LLC v. Maine Pub. Util. Comm'n",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Does it matter who is the challenger? Are you in a different position than the other parties to this action? You're a third party who is being bound to a particular rate. The others do have a different interest, or they're in a different position with respect to their challenges, correct? So aren't you in a different position than those other challengers? So why doesn't that difference do what the D.C. Circuit said? No. I do understand that, but that's what I'm trying to get to. The D.C. Circuit Court's reasoning was very simple: You're a contracting party; you're bound to it. Why should the others who didn't agree to this term be bound by Mobile-Sierra? That's the essence of their holding. So then does that bind all types of third parties? But you just said to Justice Scalia that the court below didn't find that this was a contract rate. It assumed it, so you're asking us to assume the same thing and announce-- --an advisory opinion that if these are contract rates, they're bound by Mobile-Sierra; and if they're not, what are we supposed to do? Is there -- what would happen in a situation in which there's a tariff price instead of a contract price? In those situations, the buyer could come in, presumably, and say: It's not a fair and just price vis-à-vis me; I didn't agree to it; it's not. In a normal situation with a contract price, third parties, many not -- not the main -- main parties, like the Maine Public Utilities Commission, could come in and say what? It's not fair to the public in general? Yes. Could they come in and show that between the contracting parties the price is unfair? Is that what this is about, that they would try to come in and somehow define the public interest as being informed by the unfairness to the individual parties? Well, but that's the question before us. The D.C. Circuit said they shouldn't be bound by that determination, and you're arguing that they should be because-- --So it goes back to my original question with your adversary, which is: Is there a difference among the objectors here, between those who are objecting to the terms between the two contracting parties as outsiders, as members of the public, and those who are objecting because this settlement agreement does something different? It binds them personally to a buying price, and so why shouldn't there be a different approach to those individuals? I agree. And so the question is: Should there be a distinction? And that's what the Third Circuit -- I'm sorry, that's what the court below didn't-- Well, they can self-supply, can't they? Can I -- can I go -- stop you there, just so that we're all on the same page? If this were, hypothetically, a contract rate -- some of the transition fees appear to be. The parties to that agreement are saying, we're going to pay, in transition fees, X amount. Assuming, for the sake of argument, that the transition fees are contract rates, are you disputing the circuit court's analysis that the Mobile-Sierra doctrine applies to those contract rates and binds third parties who are challenging that particular rate between those two parties? Well, that -- you can't because that's the doctrine. Okay. Under what circumstances could a third party challenge that rate as not fair and reasonable, as opposed to being contrary to the public interest? You haven't answered my question. Under what circumstances -- I've given you the absolute minimum example. There's a rate set between two parties, what third parties -- under what circumstances could a third party come in and say -- on some standard different than contrary to the public interest, how could they prove other that that rate's not fair and reasonable? What does the word ""directly affected"" mean to you? No. Now, you're trying to confuse the issue. Yes, that's the auction question and whether that auction is a contract price subject to the Mobile-Sierra doctrine at all. That's a different issue. I've given you the simple hypothetical. Could all of those other respondents -- except NSTAR -- come in and say that it's not fair and reasonable to me because, at the end, I'm going to pay more; I'm going to do something -- it's going to affect me in some indirect way. Are you taking the position that there's something else that FERC must do when those third parties come into -- into that simple situation? You want to keep going back to the facts, and I'm dealing with a hypothetical. So you are taking the extreme -- you are accepting that -- what the lower court said? Under every circumstance, if it involves a contract price, fair and reasonable being something other than contrary to the public interest? So your adversary's arguments that what you're really saying is you can never have finality to a contract agreement between parties because any third party can come in and raise-- stand in the shoes of the contracting parties and argue the rate's not fair and reasonable? ",do it matter who be the challenger be you in a different position than the other party to this action you be a third party who be be bind to a particular rate the others do have a different interest or they be in a different position with respect to their challenge correct so be not you in a different position than those other challenger so why do not that difference do what the dc circuit say no i do understand that but that be what I be try to get to the dc circuit court s reasoning be very simple you be a contract party you be bind to it why should the others who do not agree to this term be bind by mobile sierra that be the essence of their holding so then do that bind all type of third party but you just say to justice scalia that the court below do not find that this be a contract rate it assume it so you be ask us to assume the same thing and announce an advisory opinion that if these be contract rate they be bind by mobile sierra and if they be not what be we suppose to do be there what would happen in a situation in which there be a tariff price instead of a contract price in those situation the buyer could come in presumably and say it be not a fair and just price vi vis me i do not agree to it it be not in a normal situation with a contract price third party many not not the main main party like the maine public utility commission could come in and say what it be not fair to the public in general yes could they come in and show that between the contracting party the price be unfair be that what this be about that they would try to come in and somehow define the public interest as be inform by the unfairness to the individual party well but that be the question before us the dc circuit say they should not be bind by that determination and you be argue that they should be because so it go back to my original question with your adversary which be be there a difference among the objector here between those who be object to the term between the two contract party as outsider as member of the public and those who be object because this settlement agreement do something different it bind them personally to a buying price and so why should not there be a different approach to those individual i agree and so the question be should there be a distinction and that be what the third circuit I be sorry that be what the court below do not well they can self supply can not they can i can i go stop you there just so that we be all on the same page if this we be hypothetically a contract rate some of the transition fee appear to be the party to that agreement be say we be go to pay in transition fee x amount assuming for the sake of argument that the transition fee be contract rate be you dispute the circuit court s analysis that the mobile sierra doctrine applies to those contract rate and bind third party who be challenge that particular rate between those two party well that you can not because that be the doctrine okay under what circumstance could a third party challenge that rate as not fair and reasonable as oppose to be contrary to the public interest you have not answer my question under what circumstance I have give you the absolute minimum example there be a rate set between two party what third party under what circumstance could a third party come in and say on some standard different than contrary to the public interest how could they prove other that that rate s not fair and reasonable what do the word directly affect mean to you no now you be try to confuse the issue yes that be the auction question and whether that auction be a contract price subject to the mobile sierra doctrine at all that be a different issue I have give you the simple hypothetical could all of those other respondent except nstar come in and say that it be not fair and reasonable to me because at the end I be go to pay more I be go to do something it be go to affect me in some indirect way be you take the position that there be something else that ferc must do when those third party come into into that simple situation you want to keep go back to the fact and I be deal with a hypothetical so you be take the extreme you be accept that what the low court say under every circumstance if it involve a contract price fair and reasonable be something other than contrary to the public interest so your adversary s argument that what you be really say be you can never have finality to a contract agreement between party because any third party can come in and raise stand in the shoe of the contracting party and argue the rate s not fair and reasonable ,364.66000000000014,Roberts Court,"Nov 3, 2009",NRG Power Marketing LLC et al.,Maine Public Utilities Commission et al.,08-674,"Apr 27, 2009","Jan 13, 2010",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2009,United States v. O'Brien,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"No, but you're forgetting the words of this subsection. I mean-- --the subsection would be (B) itself. If you're convicted of carrying a machinegun, you get -- I'm sorry -- a short-barrel rifle, et cetera, you get 10 years. If it's a machinegun, you get 30. What's -- what's irrational about reading the statute that way when it uses the word ""subsection""? It didn't use ""subparagraph"". But it didn't. It kept in (A) the subdivisions of use and brandishing, which we all agree are elements of the crime. So I don't know what it means to say that it moved it away from the elements. It mixed up in (A) elements and sentencing factors, and so what we have to discern was, did it intend to make (B) sentencing factors or not? And I think what Justice Breyer was asking you: What in the legislative history shows that? Where do we read, outside of Castillo, a conclusion that somehow Congress radically changed the assumptions we identified in Castillo, which is historically it's not a sentencing element? Is there a Sixth Amendment problem with reading a statute this way, with -- with reading a statute to provide for an unlimited maximum when Congress hasn't specified it, and now you're going to have the judge find the minimum and the maximum? But isn't there a Sixth Amendment problem with not knowing what you are exposed to? And then doesn't the minimum in that case sort of become de facto the maximum? Isn't a minimum always a maximum? In -- to the person who would otherwise, in the judge's discretion, qualify for a lower sentence, doesn't it become that person's maximum once you have indiscretion? What you can rely on in an indeterminate sentencing regime without a minimum is that you've got a statutory maximum, whatever it may be, but a judge's discretion to start from zero. If that judge was inclined to give you zero, isn't the minimum then your statutory maximum? You're -- because that's what the judge has to give you. How do we find it with this statute, if there's a 10-year minimum/maximum under (A) subdivision (iii) if the firearm is discharged, and it's 10 years; and if it's a short-barreled rifle under (B), it's also an equal amount, of 10 years? I think that's what Justice Ginsburg was pointing to. So the question I have for you is: How do we find substantive unreasonableness? Unreasonableness, that there was an act of manipulation here, or intent to manipulate. Exactly. ",no but you be forget the word of this subsection i mean the subsection would be b itself if you be convict of carry a machinegun you get I be sorry a short barrel rifle et cetera you get year if it be a machinegun you get what be what be irrational about read the statute that way when it use the word subsection it do not use subparagraph but it do not it keep in a the subdivision of use and brandishing which we all agree be element of the crime so i do not know what it mean to say that it move it away from the element it mix up in a element and sentence factor and so what we have to discern be do it intend to make b sentence factor or not and i think what justice breyer be ask you what in the legislative history show that where do we read outside of castillo a conclusion that somehow congress radically change the assumption we identify in castillo which be historically it be not a sentence element be there a sixth amendment problem with read a statute this way with with read a statute to provide for an unlimited maximum when congress have not specify it and now you be go to have the judge find the minimum and the maximum but be not there a sixth amendment problem with not know what you be expose to and then do not the minimum in that case sort of become de facto the maximum be not a minimum always a maximum in to the person who would otherwise in the judge s discretion qualify for a low sentence do not it become that person s maximum once you have indiscretion what you can rely on in an indeterminate sentencing regime without a minimum be that you have get a statutory maximum whatever it may be but a judge s discretion to start from zero if that judge be incline to give you zero be not the minimum then your statutory maximum you be because that be what the judge have to give you how do we find it with this statute if there be a year minimummaximum under a subdivision iii if the firearm be discharge and it be year and if it be a short barrel rifle under b it be also an equal amount of year i think that be what justice ginsburg be point to so the question i have for you be how do we find substantive unreasonableness unreasonableness that there be an act of manipulation here or intent to manipulate exactly ,179.15999999999997,Roberts Court,"Feb 23, 2010",United States,Martin O'Brien and Arthur Burgess,08-1569,,"May 24, 2010",113.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2009,American Needle Inc. v. National Football League,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"But there was no joint venture with respect to the television rights, meaning there was no separate activity, other than the televising of the shows at issue. Here, the Solicitor General is saying there is a joint venture, and it has to do with the licensing of trademarks, with their quality control, et cetera. Isn't that a substantial difference? They couldn't -- they couldn't stop that team from joining another league? Let's assume -- and I -- you know, I don't know enough about football, but let's assume there are two leagues playing. One of them plays on Saturday and the other plays on Sunday. You are suggesting that the joint venture couldn't stop their members from joining that other league? What's the purpose of being in a venture if -- if you are free to reject it and go to somewhere else? Counsel, you -- the Solicitor General is asking us to remand under his new test to find out whether you are challenging the joint venture or challenging simply the licensing to one individual or one entity. What are you doing? Do you have an answer to that? Meaning -- I don't-- Could it -- using your example, could you tell me what the different questions would be under the single control theory you are proposing and a rule of reason application in its normal course? So what are the questions you would ask under your theory, and how do they differ from what would happen under a rule of reason analysis? Let's not go into this case. Let's -- let's stay with your single commissioner. Well, how does that stop any group of competitors from coming in and saying: Gee, I want to sell my gas; I'm going to let this single commissioner decide how much my gas will sell for, and if he chooses to sell it at the same price to everybody, both gas products, that's okay? How do you get to that? Excuse me. Did the teams -- did the NFL Properties or some centralized entity always exploit the trademarks of all the franchises, or was there a long period of time in which they each individually franchised their products? But there was some, and that was done by the individual teams? What decision could the sports teams make that would be subject to the antitrust scrutiny under your definition of the permissible range of the joint venture activities? It seems to me that if the venture wanted to make sure all the teams hired secretaries at the same $1,000-a-year salary, that under your theory, that's okay, because it's a joint venture. So the answer to my question is, there is -- you are seeking through this ruling what you haven't gotten from Congress: An absolute bar to an antitrust claim. So -- so answer my question. What decision-- --The -- if the reasonableness of this decision, that T-shirts promotes the game, is so self-evident, then why wouldn't the rule of reason control completely? Why do we need to even go to the single-entity question when, by your own answer, it is undisputed, so abundantly clear, so reasonable-- --what's the need to -- to label it single entity, as opposed to label it what it is, reasonable? But it's a single purpose -- and I certainly sympathize with that argument. But isn't the proposition of antitrust law that we have a reason for worrying about concerted activity? We have a genuine concern as -- or Congress does -- about independent entities joining together and fixing prices. And we permit them to do so, as Justice Breyer indicated, when the venture has a purpose that is independent than -- from the individual interest, but we say, when it doesn't, we have to ensure, under the rule of reason, that what they are doing is reasonable. I'm -- I am very swayed by your arguments, but I can very much see a counterargument that promoting T-shirts is only to make money. It doesn't really promote the game. It promotes the making of money. And once you fix prices for making money, that's a Sherman Act violation. But they own the trademarks, so they could.

So your-- --Wait a minute. Why -- why -- that doesn't make any sense to me. Why would we have had the creation of all of these common law immunities attached to foreign individuals like consular and diplomatic and heads of state if state sovereign immunity was going to cover them naturally? I'm trying to go before the Act, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, before it was passed, because that was Congress's first statement, and we have to figure out what they intended to replace or not replace. Before the Act came in, what activities of a consular office would not have been covered under the foreign sovereign immunity of a state? What activity could a diplomat have engaged in or a consular officer have engaged in that state immunity, as it was understood at the time, would not have given him or her? Is there any case by us in which we -- prior to the FSIA, where we recognize that an individual was immunized in the way that the state was, if he was acting as an agent of the state? Or were all of our cases having to do with other common law doctrines? Could you-- --Mr. Kneedler-- --Could you -- I'm-- --I'm sure one of my colleagues-- --will get you back. Could you address the practical implications of your position? And by that I mean, it took 2 years for the State -- for the government to respond to the district court in this case. Tell us why your reading of the statute would not grind the courts to a halt. What happens when Justice Breyer's situation arises? Someone takes a complaint against the state and just substitutes the names of the persons. What -- why wouldn't the courts come to a grinding halt? Could we go back to the practical-- Wouldn't that be the same question that you would ask invoking a common law protection like head of state or act of state? Isn't it -- whether it's under the FSIA or under a common law theory -- the identical question? Isn't that the very point? If the inquiry is the same under the FSIA and under the common law, and we're unsure what Congress intended in the FSIA, because it certainly doesn't explicitly say it covers individual acts, shouldn't we defer to the Executive's decisionmaking in what is -- has been, for centuries now, within its jurisdiction?

2010,National Aeronautics and Space Administration v. Nelson,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Katyal, is there any limit to what questions the Government can ask-- --an applicant? What does that mean? Could you ask somebody, what's your genetic make-up, because we don't want people with a gene that is predisposed to cancer? Whatever other -- could you ask that? We do, because I have to start with the question of: What are the limits on the Government, if any? Are you taking the position that as an employer, there are absolutely none, or are you taking the position that there are some, and what would they be? So what you are saying is, there is no limit? Were these two forms approved by Congress? That's a restriction on disclosure, but the same Congress can change that, correct? I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand the answer. Only 128 times has somebody identified themselves as a drug user? So it could be for any other answers as well? Are you representing to us that every employee who is rejected will know the reason? So where does the suitability matrix come in? It doesn't? And NASA has never used it? You're representing that to the Court? General -- I'm sorry. Go ahead and finish. Is your position today that our ruling should say that the Government is free to ask, as a private employer or contractor -- it is free to ask any question it wants whatsoever? If you were not saying that, then what is the narrower ruling? Because that's what I thought I heard at the beginning of our colloquy today. Well, why wouldn't that violate it if the question involved a fundamental right? If you were asking the question that Justice Alito asked, which is, what's your sexual practices in the bedroom, if there are security checks against you disclosing it, you are saying even that would be okay? Don't -- this is a bit unsatisfying. Because you start by saying to us, as long as there are some nondisclosure protections, then virtually any question, whether it impinges a fundamental right or not, would be okay, because there's -- I don't even know what the Government's interest is in asking every question it wants to. There has to be a need for a set of questions, doesn't there? So that right is subject to what level of scrutiny? Is it always strict scrutiny? And how do you square Whalen and Nixon's balancing with strict scrutiny? So that's all information about yourself? I think what Justice Breyer is getting to and that I'm trying to figure out is, you've used the word ""privacy"". What does privacy relate to? No, I'm talking about -- answer his broad question, which is -- you've defined the constitutional right to information about yourself. Is that all information about yourself, including your date of birth, your Social Security Number, your -- where you live, where you've gone to school, who are your friends, who your references are? Because as broadly as you have defined that, it would include all of that. The fundamental rights issue that the Sixth Amendment identified, are those the questions that are subject to that greater scrutiny? Are you conceding you can't meet that standard or are you saying that the Ninth Circuit misapplied that standard? Do you think there is something wrong with the Government having to explain why it seeks information? I mean, I would think that would be fairly simple in virtually every situation. I ask that question because that begs the question of can you ask anything you want regardless of why?

2010,"Talk America, Inc. v. Michigan Bell Telephone Co.",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, underlying that question is an issue that I think Justices Ginsburg and Scalia were asking. Technically feasible is different from economically ridiculous or economically burdensome. How does that, ""economically burdensome"" -- does it get considered by anyone so that -- because one could imagine, as Justice Breyer said, that a competitor could come in and say, now build me the Taj Mahal as an entrance facility or as an interconnection facility. So is there anyone controlling for that latter issue? Counsel, I know you're saying that, but everybody's arguing about what the TRO and the TRRO say or don't say. But I go behind that and I go -- I think the government's entire argument is not based even on those. It's based on the LCO regulations themselves. They've cited two, which is 51.305 and 51.321. They're not relying on those TROs in their back and forth there, they are relying on the regulation. So how do you address their point that there are two different charges at issue? --that one -- that interconnection by definition includes transport. It's hard for me to think of how it doesn't, because they've got to travel from one place to another, so-- --Now you're reading limitation into the statute. All the statute says is, you're obligated to provide interconnection services. It doesn't say how or limit it only to things that are not bottlenecks or things that are bottlenecks. It just says you're obligated to do X, and that's what the agency's saying. In that regard, in all of these years, are -- you mean to tell me there is no other incumbent that has provided interconnection services at an entrance facility and charged TELRIC rates? But that's -- that's (c)(3). (C)(2) says you just -- you have to. It imposes an affirmative obligation to provide interconnection and -- interconnection. But wait a minute. Does -- don't the regulations now and the commission's TRO, et cetera, say that an entrance facility is within your network? You haven't challenged that? It's now-- --If they're not-- --Figure 4. I guess the problem I'm having is that you tell me on the one hand that up until, what, 2005, you were always paying the cost plus profit rates, the TELRIC's rates, for interconnection at a -- at an entrance facility. Well, it did in the footnotes. It said -- that's what the whole dispute is about, which is, we're not changing the obligation to provide interconnection services. So it said it clearly.

2010,Sossamon v. Texas,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Does it include punitive damages? Does it include punitive damages? Well, except this would be a violation of a statute, not a violation of a constitutional right. So under Ex parte Young they couldn't necessarily get an injunction. But that has nothing to do with whether the language is clear or not to constitute a waiver. There is no principle of law that you are articulating that says it -- it has to be -- this is not clear enough for the Federal Government, but it is clear enough for the State. ""Appropriate relief"" either has a meaning or it doesn't. If it is, why is injunctive relief included at all? Meaning, what you seem to be saying to me is that no relief should be appropriate, because no relief is clear whether it's injunctive relief or damages? Some would say that injunctive relief attaches more to the public FISC then compensatory relief. Because future conduct or change of conduct can have an enormous intrusion on the public FISC, so why do we draw the line between saying one is more intrusive than the other? So now we have three distinctions. With respect to land use discrimination, the Rehab Act would presumably apply. So the Rehab Act says compensatory damages are permissible for that kind of discriminatory claim, so now we have compensatory damages for that. We have, potentially, compensatory damages for local governments, but not for State or Federal level. We are chopping up the statute at each stage, correct? We are treating different defendants differently and different claims differently with respect to the relief that's permissible? Could you explain why? But equity permits money as well. Equity permits money as well. What's the inducement to do it more quickly rather than to delay, to remedy the wrong faster rather than to delay? Uh-huh. That's an ideal world, that they'll respond, but there is an allegation that some prisons wait until the eve of the trial after onerous discovery on the plaintiff and after enormous harm to plaintiffs, physical and otherwise, before they capitulate.

2010,Staub v. Proctor Hospital,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Isn't that -- the government's formulation that the discrimination has to play a substantial role in the termination a limiting principle? I mean, you answered or appeared to be answering Justice Alito that in a 10-year history if one report of discrimination existed that that would shift the burden to the employer. Is that an accurate statement of law? That one report has to play a role that is more than a mere existence, doesn't it? Than the SG? But it has to have some materiality to the decision. I mean, it has to have -- it has to play not just any role. It has to play a material role in the decision, no? Or -- they use ""substantial"". It could be ""material"". Are you using proximate cause in but-for, or are you suggesting a different formulation of causation? In that formulation as you've just articulated, where do you place your test of a subordinate setting in motion and playing a substantial role? What does that test that you proposed in your brief -- how does it fit into this? Your -- Petitioner's counsel argues that there is no issue of -- in the motivating factor test, it doesn't have to be a substantial role; it just has to be a motivating factor, so that the subordinates-- Let's look at the hypothetical. Take it out of the facts of this case. There are two supervisors, each of them have anti-military animus, and they both report that this gentleman was late when he wasn't. Absolutely a falsehood. They go in, they report it to Miss Buck. Miss Buck does an investigation. There are no witnesses. There is no one else to prove that they came in late. She just takes the supervisors' word. She looks at their report moments after the employee didn't show up, and she says: He's a late-goer. I don't know anything about anti-animus; I simply fired him because two supervisors who are trustworthy, I've looked at their files, they've never lied about anything before, they are pretty honest people. What happens in that situation? How? She went and looked for witnesses, didn't find them. She looked at their records. She did -- what happened here; other people have complained about these people, don't particularly like them. Well, that's the question. You just added a very important fact, which is a 10-year history of being late. But on this day he wasn't late. On this day the two supervisors made it up. Would she have fired him absent that report? Isn't that what the jury has to decide? Well, what this circuit's ""cat's paw"" theory does and what others do say, if she engaged in any investigation there's no liability. But that assumes that the employment decision is solely hers. It's hers, not based on her peccadilloes; it's hers based on the information that she has gathered. But -- but she's not acting in a vacuum. She's acting on information that has been supplied to her by people who are authorized to supply that to her in the employment context. We are now talking past the individual case. I am talking about just the legal analysis, which is: She is a decisionmaker, but there are multiple actors on behalf of the employer. That's your adversary's position -- or participating in the process. And they are saying if any of those actors in the process has been delegated employment duties that permit them to participate in this way, then if what motivates them is bias of this kind, then the employer is responsible, not just for Ms. Buck's activities, but for the two supervisors' discriminatory activities. Well, in most situations an employer comes in and says: I fired X for X, Y, and Z reasons. And if they don't mention one of those inconsequential or immaterial reports, why would a court rely on it at all? It's not a motivating factor. ",be not that the government s formulation that the discrimination have to play a substantial role in the termination a limit principle i mean you answer or appear to be answer justice alito that in a year history if one report of discrimination exist that that would shift the burden to the employer be that an accurate statement of law that one report have to play a role that be more than a mere existence do not it than the sg but it have to have some materiality to the decision i mean it have to have it have to play not just any role it have to play a material role in the decision no or they use substantial it could be material be you use proximate because in but for or be you suggest a different formulation of causation in that formulation as you have just articulate where do you place your test of a subordinate setting in motion and play a substantial role what do that test that you propose in your brief how do it fit into this your petitioner s counsel argue that there be no issue of in the motivating factor test it do not have to be a substantial role it just have to be a motivating factor so that the subordinate let us look at the hypothetical take it out of the fact of this case there be two supervisor each of them have anti military animus and they both report that this gentleman be late when he be not absolutely a falsehood they go in they report it to miss buck miss buck do an investigation there be no witness there be no one else to prove that they come in late she just take the supervisor word she look at their report moment after the employee do not show up and she say he be a late goer i do not know anything about anti animus i simply fire him because two supervisor who be trustworthy I have look at their file they have never lie about anything before they be pretty honest people what happen in that situation how she go and look for witness do not find them she look at their record she do what happen here other people have complain about these people do not particularly like them well that be the question you just add a very important fact which be a year history of be late but on this day he be not late on this day the two supervisor make it up would she have fire him absent that report be not that what the jury have to decide well what this circuit s cat s paw theory do and what others do say if she engage in any investigation there be no liability but that assume that the employment decision be solely hers it be hers not base on her peccadillo it have hers base on the information that she have gather but but she be not act in a vacuum she be act on information that have be supply to her by people who be authorize to supply that to her in the employment context we be now talk past the individual case i be talk about just the legal analysis which be she be a decisionmaker but there be multiple actor on behalf of the employer that be your adversary s position or participating in the process and they be say if any of those actor in the process have be delegate employment duty that permit them to participate in this way then if what motivate them be bias of this kind then the employer be responsible not just for ms buck s activity but for the two supervisor discriminatory activity well in most situation an employer come in and say i fire x for x y and z reason and if they do not mention one of those inconsequential or immaterial report why would a court rely on it at all it be not a motivating factor ,305.4199999999999,Roberts Court,"Nov 2, 2010",Vincent E.

2010,"PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Excuse me. There is a legal obligation to advise the FDA when you have reports of adverse results that suggest the label may be wrong. Are you disavowing your -- your obligation to tell the FDA when something's wrong? So please describe what the difference between that obligation and the obligation to suggest a label change when you know it's been misbranded. So what's -- so what's the conflict with State law, meaning you have an obligation to keep your label as it is, but if you also have a Federal obligation to advise the FDA of adverse -- of adverse results and of needs for change, why can't you then comply with a duty to warn obligation because you can go to the -- to the FDA? Counsel, do you think-- --Counsel, do you think Congress really intended to create a market in which consumers can only sue brand-named products? Because if that's the case, why would anybody ever take a genetic? And why in the world would Congress create a different, or even the FDA, a different obligation on brand-named products or generic products to give them information about labels when they know there's been a misbranding? What the government says is you start by instructing a jury that there had to actually have been information that proved a misbranding. That's the first step of the tort suit according to the government. So why should you or why would Congress or the FDA have intended to treat the two differently? Counsel, all you're arguing is that this rule will have little practical effect, that there is going to be very few lawsuits that could be brought against your companies because you're just not going to have enough information to suggest a label change. Can you, and I think that this is part of what your adversary has been talking about when he says we don't usually receive adverse incident reports; they go to the brand manufacturer. So tell me what you view as your main obligation. This is a little bit like what Justice Scalia was asking. You come in and you say there's a drug, it has an adverse effect, there should have been a warning about it because look at all of this literature, look at all of this proof-- --that this drug is, in fact, in some way plausibly or otherwise causing this incident, and the label was inadequate to tell me not to do it. Is that your obligation completely? You don't have an obligation to show that this particular manufacturer knew that in some way? Am I -- am I to understand -- and I think I am understanding you. There is a legal obligation in the statute to report adverse events. You're saying that the statute also requires every manufacturer, of whatever type, to monitor the safety of the drug they're selling? Is that what you're saying? And if reasonable evidence, whether directly in their possession or in the marketplace-- Counsel, the difference, as I see it, is that they're not suing you for a failure to tell the FDA. They're suing you for a failure to tell them. It's you who are interposing a defense and saying I manufacture a dangerous drug, and I have no obligation to monitor and ensure that the label is accurate. And what the government is saying, as I understand it is, no, you do. Yes, we understand you want to sell more cheaply, but not at the cost of public health. So what's wrong with that argument?

2010,J.D.B. v. North Carolina,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"So-- --are you saying, going back to the hypotheticals that some of my colleagues posed, police officer comes across an individual, looks older or looks younger, doesn't know, and just engages that person and says come over here and let's talk for a second. Is the officer required to ask the age? So if they're not required-- --Perhaps not, but it's -- if it's outside a school, school corner. No reasonable suspicion, just says come over here, kid. Is he supposed to ask the age to see if he's 19 or 18 or 17? It is, because it's a stop with no reasonable suspicion. And the kid comes over, and the officer stands him there and continues to talk to him for half an hour. So why don't we go back to the test that Justice Breyer suggested, which would answer many of the hypotheticals here, that the objective fact is what is known to both? That way you don't get into what the 13-year-old is thinking inside himself or not, because that then becomes subjective; you don't go back to what others might think are special characteristics or subjective characteristics. You go to what's known, what's an objective factor known to both. I think that's clear, but that's different. I mean, you can tell the difference between a 9-year-old, I think, and an adult generally. And I'm hard pressed to think that anyone would believe that if you took a 9-year-old out of his classroom and the assistant principal walked him into a room and said these guys want to talk to you, that that 9-year-old would think he's free to leave. Right. So objectively that's a fact known to everyone, that it's a 9-year-old. Excuse me, haven't we repeatedly said that it's going to be very difficult for a defendant to show that his confession wasn't involuntary if there was no Miranda violation? Isn't the entire purpose of Miranda and its requirement because there was a belief that it wasn't -- that voluntariness wasn't enough -- was not good enough because it was such a high bar, to secure the privilege against self-incrimination? That doesn't answer my question. If we've said if you're not in custody, it's going to be nearly impossible for you to show that your statement was involuntary, are you now accepting that with respect to age a 9-year-old may not feel free to leave as opposed to a 13 or 14-year-old, that somehow we should instruct the courts that age really needs to be stepped up in the voluntariness test? So are you happy with the rule that says, no, not in the objective Miranda test, but, yes, age should be elevated as a prime consideration in the voluntariness test? So how is that different than blindness or hearing? A person with Down's syndrome, many -- some don't -- show characteristics that they're not capable of comprehension, or not capable of absorbing information. They barely look at you, they barely -- you know, there are characteristics that show you a lack of absorption of information. ",so be you say go back to the hypothetical that some of my colleague pose police officer come across an individual look old or look young do not know and just engages that person and say come over here and let us talk for a second be the officer require to ask the age so if they be not require perhaps not but it be if it be outside a school school corner no reasonable suspicion just say come over here kid be he suppose to ask the age to see if he be or or it be because it be a stop with no reasonable suspicion and the kid come over and the officer stand him there and continue to talk to him for half an hour so why do not we go back to the test that justice breyer suggest which would answer many of the hypothetical here that the objective fact be what be know to both that way you do not get into what the year old be think inside himself or not because that then become subjective you do not go back to what others might think be special characteristic or subjective characteristic you go to what be know what be an objective factor know to both i think that be clear but that be different i mean you can tell the difference between a year old i think and an adult generally and I be hard press to think that anyone would believe that if you take a year old out of his classroom and the assistant principal walk him into a room and say these guy want to talk to you that that year old would think he be free to leave right so objectively that be a fact know to everyone that it be a year old excuse me have not we repeatedly say that it be go to be very difficult for a defendant to show that his confession be not involuntary if there be no miranda violation be not the entire purpose of miranda and its requirement because there be a belief that it be not that voluntariness be not enough be not good enough because it be such a high bar to secure the privilege against self incrimination that do not answer my question if we have say if you be not in custody it be go to be nearly impossible for you to show that your statement be involuntary be you now accept that with respect to age a year old may not feel free to leave as oppose to a or year old that somehow we should instruct the court that age really need to be step up in the voluntariness test so be you happy with the rule that say no not in the objective miranda test but yes age should be elevate as a prime consideration in the voluntariness test so how be that different than blindness or hearing a person with down s syndrome many some do not show characteristic that they be not capable of comprehension or not capable of absorb information they barely look at you they barely you know there be characteristic that show you a lack of absorption of information ,205.44,Roberts Court,"Mar 23, 2011",J.D.B.,North Carolina,09-11121,"Nov 1, 2010","Jun 16, 2011",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2010,Cullen v. Pinholster,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Could we just clarify what you mean by ""factual basis""? To be precise, he didn't -- because he didn't present the expert opinion with the diagnosis, or because the diagnosis was based on a series of facts that to me appear to have been presented fully to the State court; is that correct? With the exception of the fact that the defense attorneys only worked 6 hours, the billing records. I think that's the only underlying facts in the opinion that appear new; am I correct? So we are only talking about the expert opinion facts being new? What -- besides the opinion, what were they? Well, he did allege that in his petition before the State court? Not specifically, but he said that his counsel didn't prepare. And he pointed to the fact that counsel basically said at the trial, I didn't think we were to have a mitigation hearing, as proof of that, correct. Can we just be clear? I thought that Dr. Stahlberg's affidavit in the State court said that he had brain damage of some sort. I thought it said that he -- the school records show evidence of mental disturbances and some degree of brain damage. What he did say -- I think there is a difference between -- because he pointed to epilepsy. He pointed to a series of things that showed some brain damage. I just want to clarify. It's not organic damage; the issue is whether the organic damage created a dysfunctionality that contributed to the events. That's what he didn't know, and he said: It's not -- I would have needed more information to figure that out. No, no, no. Organic brain damage dysfunctionality. There is a difference between the two diagnoses. Your adversary points to the difference in language between (d)(1) and (d)(2). (D)(2) refers to unreasonable in light of the facts, unreasonable determination of facts in light of the record before the Court, and subdivision (1) doesn't. It speaks only an unreasonable decision. Could you address the difference in the language and why that difference doesn't suggest that the question of an unreasonable legal determination should be based on the record before the Federal court, which in most instances, the vast majority of instances, is just a State court record? But there are exceptions in (e)(2) for hearings. So why shouldn't the first subdivision be read to mean unreasonable legal determination in light of the record before the court? Are you suggesting that if a State court gets a proffer of evidence from a State petitioner who says: I have a billing record that shows that my attorney worked only 6 hours, and the State says: We are not admitting that billing record because it hasn't been authenticated, so we're not looking at that fact, and the Federal habeas looks at what was proffered and says: This is authentication under any rule, State or Federal. It was improperly admitted, so their legal determination was wrong. Not unreasonable legal determination as to the IAC, because in fact -- I used the example of 6 hours. The billing record could show 5 minutes, so that there is no dispute that the person spent essentially no time on mitigation, didn't present anything. The clearest case you want. You are suggesting that a habeas corpus court is no longer permitted to look at that new evidence? But I'm going back to (d)(1). It's not symmetrical. There is a paragraph right after what you cite that basically says unless there is a hearing. So -- Holland -- doesn't stop at the point that you are quoting. It goes on in the very next sentence to say ""unless a hearing has been held. "" So why don't we start the way that you are proposing, which is to start with (e)(2), was the hearing appropriately held, first? And if it was, why are we excluding the evidence that was developed at that hearing? What you are proposing is the reverse, to say we start at (d)(1)-- --and only if the Petitioner wins under (d)(1), on proving that the decision on the facts before that -- the State court were reasonable, that you ever get to (e)(2). Why is that logical? Why isn't it logical to start with (e)(2), which is -- it says in (e)(2) these are the prerequisites to having a hearing, you prove you are entitled to it. Why are we excluding those facts from the decisionmakers' consideration? Counsel, I can tell you the one thing you've said that makes no sense. There is nothing logical about this statute, or clear about this statute, as the legion of cases that the lower courts have addressed in trying to interpret it, and as the legion Supreme Court cases that have dealt with this statute-- --No. Could you go back to Justice Kagan's earlier question of how we draw the line? At what level of generality is sufficient to say that a factual basis of a claim has been developed? But why? Explain why that -- the opinion is not a fact, that's different. Could you just clarify again for me? I'm not sure I understand. Do the billing records, when do they get disclosed to-- --Counsel, could I just ask one clarifying question. In the Second Circuit for many years you had the record on appeal which the parties prepared, but you also had the record below which was sent automatically to the judges to review as well. The billing records that we're talking about, you say they were part of the record below, would that automatically have been sent under California law to the reviewing court? Could you clarify the procedure question I asked earlier: Were the billing records made part of the record that went up to the California reviewing courts? Are you claiming the 6-hour one didn't go up? I'm just asking a simple question. Was the -- were the billing records that were used ultimately to calculate the six hours-- --were they before the California reviewing courts? But if I'm on the reviewing court, and the lawyer spent no time preparing-- --When I was reviewing judge on the Court of Appeals, someone said he didn't spend any time doing X, Y, and Z, and the first thing I went to was the billing records. Do the billing records dispute that or not? So I have to assume -- I don't have to assume, but it's not new evidence. They had it before them. ",could we just clarify what you mean by factual basis to be precise he do not because he do not present the expert opinion with the diagnosis or because the diagnosis be base on a series of fact that to me appear to have be present fully to the state court be that correct with the exception of the fact that the defense attorney only work hour the billing record i think that be the only underlying fact in the opinion that appear new be i correct so we be only talk about the expert opinion fact be new what besides the opinion what we be they well he do allege that in his petition before the state court not specifically but he say that his counsel do not prepare and he point to the fact that counsel basically say at the trial i do not think we we be to have a mitigation hearing as proof of that correct can we just be clear i think that dr stahlberg s affidavit in the state court say that he have brain damage of some sort i think it say that he the school record show evidence of mental disturbance and some degree of brain damage what he do say i think there be a difference between because he point to epilepsy he point to a series of thing that show some brain damage i just want to clarify it be not organic damage the issue be whether the organic damage create a dysfunctionality that contribute to the event that be what he do not know and he say it be not i would have need more information to figure that out no no no organic brain damage dysfunctionality there be a difference between the two diagnosis your adversary point to the difference in language between d and d d refers to unreasonable in light of the fact unreasonable determination of fact in light of the record before the court and subdivision do not it speak only an unreasonable decision could you address the difference in the language and why that difference do not suggest that the question of an unreasonable legal determination should be base on the record before the federal court which in most instance the vast majority of instance be just a state court record but there be exception in e for hearing so why should not the first subdivision be read to mean unreasonable legal determination in light of the record before the court be you suggest that if a state court get a proffer of evidence from a state petitioner who say i have a billing record that show that my attorney work only hour and the state say we be not admit that billing record because it have not be authenticate so we be not look at that fact and the federal habeas look at what be proffer and say this be authentication under any rule state or federal it be improperly admit so their legal determination be wrong not unreasonable legal determination as to the iac because in fact i use the example of hour the billing record could show minute so that there be no dispute that the person spend essentially no time on mitigation do not present anything the clear case you want you be suggest that a habeas corpus court be no longer permit to look at that new evidence but I be go back to d it be not symmetrical there be a paragraph right after what you cite that basically say unless there be a hearing so holland do not stop at the point that you be quote it go on in the very next sentence to say unless a hearing have be held so why do not we start the way that you be propose which be to start with e be the hearing appropriately hold first and if it be why be we exclude the evidence that be develop at that hearing what you be propose be the reverse to say we start at d and only if the petitioner win under d on prove that the decision on the fact before that the state court we be reasonable that you ever get to e why be that logical why be not it logical to start with e which be it say in e these be the prerequisite to have a hearing you prove you be entitle to it why be we exclude those fact from the decisionmakers consideration counsel i can tell you the one thing you have say that make no sense there be nothing logical about this statute or clear about this statute as the legion of case that the low court have address in try to interpret it and as the legion supreme court case that have deal with this statute no could you go back to justice kagan s early question of how we draw the line at what level of generality be sufficient to say that a factual basis of a claim have be develop but why explain why that the opinion be not a fact that be different could you just clarify again for me I be not sure i understand do the billing record when do they get disclose to counsel could i just ask one clarify question in the second circuit for many year you have the record on appeal which the party prepare but you also have the record below which be send automatically to the judge to review as well the billing record that we be talk about you say they we be part of the record below would that automatically have be send under california law to the review court could you clarify the procedure question i ask earlier we be the billing record make part of the record that go up to the california review court be you claim the hour one do not go up I be just ask a simple question be the we be the billing record that we be use ultimately to calculate the six hour we be they before the california review court but if I be on the review court and the lawyer spend no time prepare when i be review judge on the court of appeal someone say he do not spend any time do x y and z and the first thing i go to be the billing record do the billing record dispute that or not so i have to assume i do not have to assume but it be not new evidence they have it before them ,451.9499999999999,Roberts Court,"Nov 9, 2010","Vincent Cullen, Acting Warden",Scott Lynn

That's a different question than mine. Does the Patent Office require the assignment for purposes of showing ownership of the patent? Could I ask -- that all sounds to me like there's an assumption about assignments, even in the patent law, that you -- the section that you just recited to me says a promise to assign will get you an assignment if the inventor won't give it to you. How-- --Is there any conceivable reason that, under the Bayh-Dole Act, whose intent was to protect the government's interests after it's funded the discovery or implementation of an invention, that Congress would have ever wanted the university and the inventor to be able to circumvent the act by failing to secure an assignment? But frankly, every act before this one -- actually, the IPA -- required that the contractor seek assignments from inventors. Why would this act omit such a critical term if it didn't intend to vest title in the contractor? The government just said -- if we say that the contractor and the inventor can do what they want, what sane university wouldn't enter into agreements with employees letting the employees retain title to their inventions and just sharing royalties thereafter? It wouldn't make any sense for universities to do what you're saying -- get assignments -- because they could just continue taking the bulk of the royalties. Sorry. They -- they do. I mean, the general rule is that the inventor owns the patent. And there -- there is proof that they can go into court, an employer can go into court and show that the inventor was hired for this specific item and the law would presume or recognize the employer's rights; but why would Congress leave all of that up to the nature of the contract that the university entered into with its inventors? But the -- but the question I started with and Justice Kagan has picked up on, why would Congress create this act relying on assignments and not have a provision requiring one? Nothing in the Act, nothing in its regulations, nowhere is there a requirement that Federal contractors seek assignments. Do you think that Cetus would have let the doctor in absent the agreement between Cetus and Stanford? Wasn't that the primary reason they permitted the doctor in? It wasn't for this ephemeral assignment of an unknown invention. It was because the university and the company had entered into a share agreement of what would happen if they contributed to a Stanford invention.

Virtually all of them added an instruction to the jury of some sort that said that the application of the standard should take into account the fact that the PTO did not consider evidence -- did not consider the prior art relied upon in the invalidity challenge. You didn't ask for such an instruction in this case; is that correct? And if you didn't, why isn't that adequate to convey the point that you're trying to convey, that a jury should, in fact, consider that the PTO never got to see that prior art? But other judges give a slightly different standard. They give a clear and convincing standard, and they add a separate instruction that tells the jury, in applying that standard, you should consider the fact that the PTO did not see this evidence. You didn't ask for that? You just asked for the preponderance of the evidence charge? Why? I mean, you said to the judge below: All you have to charge is preponderance of the evidence. You never told him: Please explain to the jury that under clear and convincing they can take into account-- Isn't there a lower court that has ruled that that standard, in the manner that you've articulated, could confuse a jury as to what clear and convincing evidence means? In fact, it's not clear and convincing evidence if you phrase it that way, that it's something less than that.

Are the three phrases different? And how much more detail do you have to get in to describe that difference in a comprehensible way? You're really suggesting that the defense attorney here wouldn't have argued the concept of proximate cause in saying the negligence had nothing to do with him just deciding to hit the brake? --I -- I -- I -- it's farfetched, don't you think, that because the judge refused to give a proximate cause charge that the idea of it wasn't argued to the jury: What we did didn't cause this.

Can I -- can I go back a second and perhaps follow up Justice Scalia's question in a slightly different way? Do you believe a railroad can be held liable for a harm it could not reasonably foresee? All right. Now, perhaps, we can get to why, under what formulation, if it didn't know harm was going to happen or could happen. Reasonably foreseeable.

2010,FCC v. AT&T Inc.,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Can I ask you a question. I'm not sure I understood your response to Justice Scalia. If there is ambiguity, if a term can be given two meanings, and it's not clear -- and I know you're challenging the clarity question here -- I thought that Congress's intent to have full disclosure would necessarily mean that where there's ambiguity as to the meaning of an exception then we should change the narrowest meaning. So if an individual has been -- individual human being has been investigated by the FBI and a FOIA request is made for records related to that investigation, would the name of the individual not be turned over? Yes. Well, that's the point. So really your adversary is saying that the same harm that occurs to an individual -- putting aside the difficulty of defining privacy more broadly, but the same harm that occurs to an individual who is disclosed to have been the target of an investigation is an identical privacy right of a corporation; or a corporation has the same negative effects on the individual. So I think they would concede that privacy might need to be defined differently for corporations. They're simply saying this privacy interest is not. It's hard to think they pled guilty already. So it is hard to imagine how much exponentially more damaging-- --But that presupposes some sort of investigation. So that's public knowledge. What would be similar to medical files as such, under Exemption 6, that uses the same phrase, ""unwanted invasion on personal privacy""? So what would your reading do to Exemption 6, and how would we create or even make sense of Exemption 6? Why? I mean, if you're saying that personal privacy has some overlap with individual privacy -- obviously, it has to if you're going to give meaning to personal privacy -- don't we have to give meaning to ""and similar files""?

2010,"Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, I thought their expert didn't aggregate them together. He did it regionally, not store by store, as your expert did, number one; and, number two, that he performed, as accepted by the district court, and affirmed by the circuit court, any number of controlled variable comparisons, including job history, job ratings, and other things, and found that the disparity could not be explained on any of the normal variables that one would expect and that the disparity was significantly much higher than the 10 competitors of Wal-Mart and what they were paying their labor force. So, what is speculative about that, number one? And, two, why is that kind of statistical analysis inadequate to show that a policy of some sort exists? Well, that begs the legal question, which is -- you're right. Ultimately, you may win and prove to a factfinder that this analysis is fatally flawed, but what the district court concluded was that on the basis of your expert, whom he discounted because your expert was -- was basing analysis on -- on premises that the court found not acceptable, that there was enough here after a rigorous analysis. What's the standard that the court should use in upsetting that factual conclusion? Counsel, would-- --Would that bar the (b)(2) class? Meaning if their claim is, as they state it, that they're seeking injunctive and declaratory relief against a discriminatory impact or -- case or a pattern and practice case, wouldn't that have value and wouldn't that value be, standing alone without the damages component, be that the plaintiffs who come in later have a presumption that discrimination affected them and the burden shifts to Wal-Mart to prove that there was a nondiscriminatory reason? Even if they did, why couldn't you separate out the (b)(2) issue from the (b)(3) question of whether monetary damages have enough common facts and law to warrant a certification under (b)(3)? So, would you address the -- address them separately for me, and tell me why a (b)(2) class couldn't exist only on injunctive relief? And if it can, if you're conceding it can, then is your attack merely that the monetary component of this, the back pay -- which, you know, I know the dispute on whether that's equitable relief or compensatory relief or not -- why that just can't be separated out and put into the (b)(3) claim? That begs my question. Are you talking about any monetary relief? You're -- you're claiming, I'm assuming, that monetary relief includes equitable relief. The Fifth Circuit has described a test where it doesn't use the predominant question; it uses the incidental test. What's wrong with that test? I -- that's where I'm going to. Would you accept that incidental test as appropriate to the question of when monetary damages predominate or don't? What would the injunction look like in this case? Counsel-- --Counsel, I'm -- I'm a little confused, all right? Because you're saying an individualized hearing is impossible, but that's exactly what you're saying you're going to do, only through statistics. You're going to say through my statistical model, I will be able to identify those women in the class who are deserving of pay raises. What that doesn't answer is when in this process is the defendant going to be given an opportunity to defend against that finding? Because you're -- are you suggesting that the district court would appropriately bar a defendant where there's no proof of intentionality with respect to not keeping records, that it was intended to stop these women from collecting money, et cetera? When are they going to get a chance? And if they're going to get a chance, isn't that an individualized hearing? No, no, no. That sounds like you're saying their only opportunity will be on the model. They will be precluded from attempting to show any particular evidence that a particular decision was not made? You're not answering me. You're -- what you're saying is we're going to preclude them from doing anything but offering a mathematical model-- --because otherwise it's going to be too hard to have individual hearings. You don't -- you don't seriously contend that if a plaintiff, if a policy were found or practice of discrimination that a woman couldn't come in and say they put X in, I had a longer history at Wal-Mart, I had far superior job ratings, I had no criticisms of my work, and I wasn't promoted. Wouldn't that be enough for her to show that that policy influenced her lack of selection? And your personal database has all that information. So, why is it impossible to try these cases other than because of their large numbers? That's a different issue. I think he's just making your -- their point, which is if they started paying women the same as men, they might get more diversity. Well, that's the whole issue that's in dispute. ",counsel i think their expert do not aggregate them together he do it regionally not store by store as your expert do number one and number two that he perform as accept by the district court and affirm by the circuit court any number of controlled variable comparison include job history job rating and other thing and find that the disparity could not be explain on any of the normal variable that one would expect and that the disparity be significantly much high than the competitor of wal mart and what they we be pay their labor force so what be speculative about that number one and two why be that kind of statistical analysis inadequate to show that a policy of some sort exists well that beg the legal question which be you be right ultimately you may win and prove to a factfinder that this analysis be fatally flaw but what the district court conclude be that on the basis of your expert whom he discount because your expert be be base analysis on on premise that the court find not acceptable that there be enough here after a rigorous analysis what be the standard that the court should use in upset that factual conclusion counsel would would that bar the b class mean if their claim be as they state it that they be seek injunctive and declaratory relief against a discriminatory impact or case or a pattern and practice case would not that have value and would not that value be stand alone without the damage component be that the plaintiff who come in later have a presumption that discrimination affect them and the burden shift to wal mart to prove that there be a nondiscriminatory reason even if they do why could not you separate out the b issue from the b question of whether monetary damage have enough common fact and law to warrant a certification under b so would you address the address them separately for me and tell me why a b class could not exist only on injunctive relief and if it can if you be concede it can then be your attack merely that the monetary component of this the back pay which you know i know the dispute on whether that be equitable relief or compensatory relief or not why that just can not be separate out and put into the b claim that beg my question be you talk about any monetary relief you be you be claim I be assume that monetary relief include equitable relief the fifth circuit have describe a test where it do not use the predominant question it use the incidental test what be wrong with that test i that be where I be go to would you accept that incidental test as appropriate to the question of when monetary damage predominate or do not what would the injunction look like in this case counsel counsel I be I be a little confused all right because you be say an individualized hearing be impossible but that be exactly what you be say you be go to do only through statistic you be go to say through my statistical model i will be able to identify those woman in the class who be deserve of pay raise what that do not answer be when in this process be the defendant go to be give an opportunity to defend against that finding because you be be you suggest that the district court would appropriately bar a defendant where there be no proof of intentionality with respect to not keep record that it be intend to stop these woman from collect money et cetera when be they go to get a chance and if they be go to get a chance be not that an individualized hearing no no no that sound like you be say their only opportunity will be on the model they will be preclude from attempt to show any particular evidence that a particular decision be not make you be not answer me you be what you be say be we be go to preclude them from do anything but offer a mathematical model because otherwise it be go to be too hard to have individual hearing you do not you do not seriously contend that if a plaintiff if a policy we be find or practice of discrimination that a woman could not come in and say they put x in i have a longer history at wal mart i have far superior job rating i have no criticism of my work and i be not promote would not that be enough for her to show that that policy influence her lack of selection and your personal database have all that information so why be it impossible to try these case other than because of their large number that be a different issue i think he be just make your their point which be if they start pay woman the same as men they might get more diversity well that be the whole issue that be in dispute ,355.53,Roberts Court,"Mar 29, 2011","Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","Betty Dukes, et al.",10-277,"Dec 6, 2010","Jun 20, 2011",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2010,Turner v. Rogers,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Waxman, the Solicitor General suggests that the failure in this case or the failure to appoint counsel arises from a due process complaint that the -- that the -- that the Petitioner here didn't know that he had indigency as a defense, or what he needed to prove or to bring to court to prove that. Why wouldn't the Solicitor General's solution of saying as long as a State tells a defendant that they have a burden of proof and some contours of what proof they need to supply or -- on that issue, that that would satisfy due process? What can a lawyer do when someone comes in and says, I'm not earning any money, I can't earn it, blah, blah, blah, end of story? What do you need? Why do you need-- --He admitted that. At least up until the accident. And you don't think an individual is capable of saying, I can't -- I'm -- yes, I am or no I'm not using up my money on drugs; that's my preference? Or I have a $1,500 car, but I need it to be able to do something else? Where is that form in the record? Where is the form in the record? I'm sorry. I'm not hearing you. Could you speak more loudly? Counsel, as I -- and then I think one of the deficiencies in addressing your argument is that I don't really know what the State's procedures are. Your -- your co-counsel, Mr. Waxman, has said there was actually a form. I don't know what that form looks like. The only thing that does seem missing that the State clearly provides is a requirement that the judge explain what the basis of his contempt finding is. I'm looking at 60A and 61A, and this judge left it completely blank. So is this a due process violation facially, or is this a due process violation as applied, meaning it's just not clear to me whether south -- the State's process, in fact, has all of the elements that you're speaking about or how I make that judgment and whether the -- we didn't grant cert on the question of whether, as applied, there was a failure or not. I mean, one of the difficulties in this case is that there was really very -- no findings by the judge whatsoever. Well, the -- the form, the order for contempt of court itself, 61A, does require the judge to fill out an answer as to whether he thinks the defendant is gainfully employed or has the ability to make the payments. So it was just absent here. Counsel, do we have jurisdiction over any matter that isn't rendered in a final judgment in State court? So if we don't have jurisdiction over anything but a final judgment, how could we ever grant a stay if the State refused to? If a State refused to grant a stay. And why would South -- why would the State here have granted a stay, if it believes there's no Sixth Amendment right whatsoever to counsel? How could that litigant ever evade mootness? Can you point to any case involving support payments in which the South Carolina court has ever granted a stay? Counsel, I -- I took the solicitor general's position to be, they may accuse me of not being accurate in what I took their position to be, which is the rule would be simple. You, a State, are free to run these procedures as you choose, but not to provide counsel, you have to meet some minimum Mathews v. Eldridge requirements, and so the rule is simple. The State can do what it wants, but it has to provide minimum due process, and they've previously set forth the three, all right? So really the answer is, no, you're not automatically entitled to a lawyer if you're providing minimum due process. If you're not, then you have to provide a lawyer. All right. What's wrong with that rule? That, I think, is what the solicitor general is suggesting. So first, what's wrong with the rule? And, then, second, in a case in which I did not see and haven't yet a form that really talks about or tells the contemptor about his defense and what he needs to prove, yes, he did get a hearing but not a hearing that explored his statement that he'd been looking for work and couldn't find it, and a form, a judgment that doesn't address his current ability to pay. How does the South Carolina system comply with those minimums of due process? I don't know that that answers my question, because the way I phrased the question was very specific. South Carolina, there's no constitutional right to counsel in every proceeding, but the question presented was whether South Carolina erred that an indigent defendant has no constitutional right to appoint counsel in any civil contempt proceeding. And if the answer to that is, if the civil contempt proceeding does not comply with minimum due process requirements, counsel is required. Then isn't that an answer to the question presented? We can argue about that later. Okay. The point-- ",mr waxman the solicitor general suggest that the failure in this case or the failure to appoint counsel arises from a due process complaint that the that the that the petitioner here do not know that he have indigency as a defense or what he need to prove or to bring to court to prove that why would not the solicitor general s solution of say as long as a state tell a defendant that they have a burden of proof and some contour of what proof they need to supply or on that issue that that would satisfy due process what can a lawyer do when someone come in and say I be not earn any money i can not earn it blah blah blah end of story what do you need why do you need he admit that at least up until the accident and you do not think an individual be capable of say i can not I be yes i be or no I be not use up my money on drug that be my preference or i have a car but i need it to be able to do something else where be that form in the record where be the form in the record I be sorry I be not hear you could you speak more loudly counsel as i and then i think one of the deficiency in address your argument be that i do not really know what the state s procedure be your your co counsel mr waxman have say there be actually a form i do not know what that form look like the only thing that do seem miss that the state clearly provide be a requirement that the judge explain what the basis of his contempt finding be I be look at a and a and this judge leave it completely blank so be this a due process violation facially or be this a due process violation as applied mean it be just not clear to me whether south the state s process in fact have all of the element that you be speak about or how i make that judgment and whether the we do not grant cert on the question of whether as apply there be a failure or not i mean one of the difficulty in this case be that there be really very no finding by the judge whatsoever well the the form the order for contempt of court itself a do require the judge to fill out an answer as to whether he think the defendant be gainfully employ or have the ability to make the payment so it be just absent here counsel do we have jurisdiction over any matter that be not render in a final judgment in state court so if we do not have jurisdiction over anything but a final judgment how could we ever grant a stay if the state refuse to if a state refuse to grant a stay and why would south why would the state here have grant a stay if it believe there be no sixth amendment right whatsoever to counsel how could that litigant ever evade mootness can you point to any case involve support payment in which the south carolina court have ever grant a stay counsel i i take the solicitor general s position to be they may accuse me of not be accurate in what i take their position to be which be the rule would be simple you a state be free to run these procedure as you choose but not to provide counsel you have to meet some minimum mathews v eldridge requirement and so the rule be simple the state can do what it want but it have to provide minimum due process and they have previously set forth the three all right so really the answer be no you be not automatically entitle to a lawyer if you be provide minimum due process if you be not then you have to provide a lawyer all right what be wrong with that rule that i think be what the solicitor general be suggest so first what be wrong with the rule and then second in a case in which i do not see and have not yet a form that really talk about or tell the contemptor about his defense and what he need to prove yes he do get a hearing but not a hearing that explore his statement that he would be look for work and could not find it and a form a judgment that do not address his current ability to pay how do the south carolina system comply with those minimum of due process i do not know that that answer my question because the way i phrase the question be very specific south carolina there be no constitutional right to counsel in every proceeding but the question present be whether south carolina err that an indigent defendant have no constitutional right to appoint counsel in any civil contempt proceeding and if the answer to that be if the civil contempt proceeding do not comply with minimum due process requirement counsel be require then be not that an answer to the question present we can argue about that later okay the point ,380.87000000000006,Roberts Court,"Mar 23, 2011",Michael D.

2010,Tapia v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, aren't -- isn't punishment and rehabilitation often flip sides of each other? If you read what the judge said here, his comment was this man -- or this woman, I'm sorry, has been involved in a series -- escalating series of serious offenses. Logically, she has to be put away for a long time unless she gets rehabilitation because there's going to be no deterrence otherwise. And so, what the judge was basically saying, in my judgment -- and I don't know why it's not just the flip, which is without -- without drug treatment, we can't deter her. And so, this crime, given her background, deserves this kind of sentence. One of its by-products is a drug treatment program. How different is that, or do you really think that a judge who knows that someone is going to get a rehab program if they serve 50 months and the sentencing range is between 45 and 55, do you think that they're going to take 50 -- they're not going to choose 50 if they understand that there's no chance for this person to be deterred without drug treatment? That's a-- --Well, wait a minute. That's the whole point, because what the judge said was if she doesn't get treatment, she needs to be in jail a long time because her crime was serious, because she's just going to continue committing crimes. There's a chance if she gets it that she won't, but without it, for sure, she's not, and this is the just punishment she deserves, this amount of years. That's how I read the transcript. But you're ignoring his lengthy discussion talking about she was really going down the wrong road here. I understand her troubled past. She gets involved in alien smuggling, which is very serious. He is talking at length about the seriousness of the crime. So what I'm asking you is, if what we see is a judge who's talking about a flip situation, i.e., you need to punish strongly because the crimes are serious, and an added benefit is rehabilitation, why does that violate 3582? What about 3582, in using the word ""recognizing"", stops a judge from saying without something there's going to be no deterrence? So you're talking only about when rehabilitation is the primary purpose? So the issue here is what was the judge's primary purpose? So now we want some talismanic words where the judge says what I said? This crime is so serious that the sentence should be X amount, and now talismanically I'll say rehab is just a side effect, really the sentence is motivated by -- completely by punishment? Counsel-- --Counsel, can a judge who believes a defendant is dangerous to the public and thinks that that danger can't be abated without a drug treatment program, could the judge nevertheless under 3553(a)(2)(C) say, because of the danger to the public, I'm going to lengthen the sentence? And in the hopes that a drug rehabilitation program will be available? I don't care if it is or it's not; this person's dangerous to the community otherwise? So what's different than what the judge did here, where he talked about, explicitly, on page 26, ""it has to deter"" -- the sentence has to deter criminal conduct by others, and it has to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, and the sentence -- that's a big factor here, given her failure to appear and what she did out on bail. So, if the sentence has a dual motive, is that okay? Now, I know that you're -- there's -- there's an issue about whether this transcript can be read as a dual motive or not. But my question is, is a dual-motive sentence permissible? Isn't that what ""dual motive"" means? Unless-- --You want talismatic words. I would have picked the sentence anyway. Can you articulate an interpretation of this provision that would guide appellate review? If rehabilitation can always be a factor, then when and how does a court of appeals determine whether a judge has abused his or her discretion? You said 5 years, if the guideline range presumably is 24 months and the judge adds 5 years. But how do you define that? The simple answer is if the judge is imposing the sentence because of rehabilitation, they can't do that. Is that what you're arguing or are you arguing they can do it except within a range? I'm not quite sure I understand how far you're going. Counsel, this makes a lot of sense when we're talking about huge disparities in a guideline sentence, versus one where the judge goes outside the guidelines or imposes a greater sentence than otherwise the guidelines would determine for rehabilitation purposes. But not infrequently guideline ranges are within very narrow scopes, and in fact there are some prison advantages that you get from being sentenced to a year and a day that you don't get if you're sentenced to 12 months; and district courts routinely will choose between a year and a day or 12 months based on knowledge about what might be available if you're there for over a year. Why is that wrong? What would be the difference? You see, I'm having a hard time in this case, because if a judge comes in and says guideline range is 50 to 60, I think in the middle is perfectly fine, I just don't know whether I should give him 54 or 55 months, but I know that at 55 months there's this kind of program available. I'm going to do -- I'm going to -- you know, it is -- judging is not so precise that you know exactly where to go within the small ranges, and so there are many factors that influence that decision. Why should we announce a rule that says to a judge in those situations, don't give him that extra month? ",counsel be not be not punishment and rehabilitation often flip side of each other if you read what the judge say here his comment be this man or this woman I be sorry have be involve in a series escalate series of serious offense logically she have to be put away for a long time unless she get rehabilitation because there be go to be no deterrence otherwise and so what the judge be basically say in my judgment and i do not know why it be not just the flip which be without without drug treatment we can not deter her and so this crime give her background deserve this kind of sentence one of its by product be a drug treatment program how different be that or do you really think that a judge who know that someone be go to get a rehab program if they serve month and the sentencing range be between and do you think that they be go to take they be not go to choose if they understand that there be no chance for this person to be deter without drug treatment that be a well wait a minute that be the whole point because what the judge say be if she do not get treatment she need to be in jail a long time because her crime be serious because she be just go to continue commit crime there be a chance if she get it that she will not but without it for sure she be not and this be the just punishment she deserve this amount of year that be how i read the transcript but you be ignore his

rehabilitation why do that violate what about in use the word recognizing stop a judge from say without something there be go to be no deterrence so you be talk only about when rehabilitation be the primary purpose so the issue here be what be the judge s primary purpose so now we want some talismanic word where the judge say what i say this crime be so serious that the sentence should be x

2010,Premo v. Moore,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Is it -- if I am understanding your argument, it is that the Court erred in assuming that if the confession had been suppressed -- which you're not arguing for or against. I'm assuming you are not taking your amicus's position that we have to get to the question of what would have happened in a motion to suppress -- but that under all circumstances, if there's a suppressible confession, a defendant should never plead guilty. You are saying that that conclusion is what the Ninth Circuit drew and that was wrong? So it's another way of saying what I said, which is, no defendant should plead guilty if it's a suppressible confession? All right. So now, what is the other information that would have made a plain guilty in this case inevitable? However, that's a higher standard than you need to meet, but-- --Were those higher than the minimum he pled to? Were those mandatory minimums higher? Without any confession -- forget about the brother or the girlfriend -- assume that there had been no confession, wouldn't it have been a fair conclusion to draw that without any confession whatsoever that the plea bargaining strength of the defendant in this case would have been appreciably higher and that the prosecutor would have had to offer something-- --None of the three-- MR. KROGER -- had been made. --whatsoever. I mean, if the brother's confession -- or the confession to the brother is a very big piece of why a plea would have been reasonable in this case. Let's assume no confession. I am having a little bit of trouble here with your argument for the following reasons. Assume we suppress the confession. Why is it unreasonable for the defense attorney to have concluded that the evidence showing your client's presence at the shooting, and identification as the shooter, that it was solely that he should have gone to trial on a defense that he wasn't involved in the shooting at all. Once you put him in this shooting, then the only issue he seems to be confused about is that he thinks that because it was accidental that that presents a defense to felony murder. And that's clearly an erroneous position on his part. So what made the case so weak that the Government was never going without the confession to prove felony murder? What would have been the defense? What would have been the defense absent the confession? You have one at trial on the confession, suppressing it, how would he have defended the this case? What motive would his brother have had to put him at the scene of this shooting as the accidental killer? That's all his brother would have had to say. He was at the scene, he accidentally -- this gun went accidentally off. His brother had no pending charges against him at the time. So what does that have to do with what interest does his brother have when he has no pending charges against him at the time, he's going to use this as a future chip in case he does something wrong? To put his brother into jail for 25 years? This is illogical, counsel. Impeachable how? What motive did he have to implicate his brother? You still haven't answered that question. All you keep saying is, he was a past cooperator, he had no pending charges, and now he has a motive to do this against his brother because of that? And a competent -- and a competent counsel is supposed to accept their irrational client, who doesn't want to understand the law, and let him risk getting an aggravated felony charge brought against him, or a capital murder charge brought against him, and not -- and just go ahead? And try the case because he's not going to recommend to the client, go to trial, take the plea, because you're irrational? That's really what you are saying, that a competent attorney would not recommend to his client take the plea, and that his client wouldn't ultimately accept the plea, because the objective reality is his upside horrible and his downside is almost a given. But four witnesses put him at the scene to kidnap this guy and scare him to death. Or scare him. ",be it if i be understand your argument it be that the court err in assume that if the confession have be suppress which you be not argue for or against I be assume you be not take your amicus s position that we have to get to the question of what would have happen in a motion to suppress but that under all circumstance if there be a suppressible confession a defendant should never plead guilty you be say that that conclusion be what the ninth circuit draw and that be wrong so it be another way of say what i say which be no defendant should plead guilty if it be a suppressible confession all right so now what be the other information that would have make a plain guilty in this case inevitable however that be a high standard than you need to meet but we be those high than the minimum he plead to we be those mandatory minimum higher without any confession forget about the brother or the girlfriend assume that there have be no confession would not it have be a fair conclusion to draw that without any confession whatsoever that the plea bargaining strength of the defendant in this case would have be appreciably higher and that the prosecutor would have have to offer something none of the three mr kroger have be make whatsoever i mean if the brother s confession or the confession to the brother be a very big piece of why a plea would have be reasonable in this case let us assume no confession i be have a little bit of trouble here with your argument for the following reason assume we suppress the confession why be it unreasonable for the defense attorney to have conclude that the evidence show your client s presence at the shooting and identification as the shooter that it be solely that he should have go to trial on a defense that he be not involve in the shooting at all once you put him in this shooting then the only issue he seem to be confuse about be that he think that because it be accidental that that present a defense to felony murder and that be clearly an erroneous position on his part so what make the case so weak that the government be never go without the confession to prove felony murder what would have be the defense what would have be the defense absent the confession you have one at trial on the confession suppress it how would he have defend the this case what motive would his brother have have to put him at the scene of this shooting as the accidental killer that be all his brother would have have to say he be at the scene he accidentally this gun go accidentally off his brother have no pending charge against him at the time so what do that have to do with what interest do his brother have when he have no pending charge against him at the time he be go to use this as a future chip in case he do something wrong to put his brother into jail for year this be illogical counsel impeachable how what motive do he have to implicate his brother you still have not answer that question all you keep say be he be a past cooperator he have no pending charge and now he have a motive to do this against his brother because of that and a competent and a competent counsel be suppose to accept their irrational client who do not want to understand the law and let him risk get an aggravated felony charge bring against him or a capital murder charge bring against him and not and just go ahead and try the case because he be not go to recommend to the client go to trial take the plea because you be irrational that be really what you be say that a competent attorney would not recommend to his client take the plea and that his client would not ultimately accept the plea because the objective reality be his upside horrible and his downside be almost a give but four witness put him at the scene to kidnap this guy and scare him to death or scare him ,279.27000000000004,Roberts Court,"Oct 12, 2010","Jeff Premo, Superintendent, Oregon State Penitentiary",Randy Joseph Moore,09-658,"Mar 22, 2010","Jan 19, 2011",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2010,Kasten v. Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corp.,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"So you mean that if the Government says you've got to file a complaint with us by either calling us or submitting something in writing, and at a cocktail party a worker goes up to a Government employee in that agency, and says, you know, my company is violating the law. That that's enough? The reason I'm asking that question is related to Justice Alito's question, which is, what does filing a complaint mean? Does it have to be relative to the procedures adopted by the person that you are reporting this to? Well, at a cocktail party that employee may be there on personal time, but when he goes back to work the next morning he could do something. Is that enough? So what you are doing is he is estopping the Government from saying, the only way that you can file a complaint with us is to do it in writing. We are now forcing the Government to adopt an oral procedure even if it chose not to? Even if it thought an oral procedure would create havoc, et cetera, et cetera? What does file -- what is the meaning of ""filed""? So why is it inherently unworkable here in any greater extent that it is unworkable in all of the other statutes where oral complaints are permitted? What makes this worse than these other statutes? What would create more cases in this area as opposed to some of the other areas? Oral complaints are explicitly-- --This is the -- this was the Lochner era where they weren't even sure they could do this. But why should we read their language with a narrow reading of any complaint? What grievance -- would the bringing of a grievance, the example that Justice Breyer suggested, an employee goes to his union and says, they are violating the statute. Let's grieve it. And according to the proceedings established by the employer, they meet with the employer, and the employee does everything in the grievance and they now fire that employee. Under your reading, that's not instituting a proceeding? Then we have to address your second question, not the first. You are saying the oral wouldn't work in there? Would it work if they instituted a proceeding orally and the proceeding required itself to start orally? So we should give it no weight at all? Not even Skidmore? How long have collective bargaining arbitration agreements been in existence. How old? Do you think that when Congress wrote or caused to be instituted any proceeding under or related to this chapter, that they intended to exclude that proceeding and intended to exclude people who testified in that proceeding about a violation of the statute? Can you point me to something in the act that defines ""proceedings""-- --""related"" -- the words ""proceedings related to this chapter"", as limited only to Government proceedings? Then we're back to if Congress meant filing any complaints, either oral or in writing. I'm asking a different question, which is-- --That Congress's intent was not to protect a worker who publicly took an oath in front of an arbitrator and testified about a violation of law, that they would not have considered that retaliatory under the statute. That goes to your adversary's first argument or second argument where he says when this act was passed for all of those people, they would never have thought of going to their employer because the work ethos at the time was that those employees couldn't complain to their employers. They would always naturally go to the Government. How do you answer that? How do you disprove that point: That historically at the time this was passed in 1938, that there was a number of those employees who as a regular course of their business, filed complaints with their employers as opposed to the Government? I'm sorry. ",so you mean that if the government say you have get to file a complaint with us by either call us or submit something in writing and at a cocktail party a worker go up to a government employee in that agency and say you know my company be violate the law that that be enough the reason I be ask that question be relate to justice alito s question which be what do file a complaint mean do it have to be relative to the procedure adopt by the person that you be report this to well at a cocktail party that employee may be there on personal time but when he go back to work the next morning he could do something be that enough so what you be do be he be estopping the government from say the only way that you can file a complaint with us be to do it in write we be now force the government to adopt an oral procedure even if it choose not to even if it think an oral procedure would create havoc et cetera et cetera what do file what be the meaning of file so why be it inherently unworkable here in any great extent that it be unworkable in all of the other statute where oral complaint be permit what make this bad than these other statute what would create more case in this area as oppose to some of the other area oral complaint be explicitly this be the this be the lochner era where they be not even sure they could do this but why should we read their language with a narrow reading of any complaint what grievance would the bringing of a grievance the example that justice breyer suggest an employee go to his union and say they be violate the statute let us grieve it and accord to the proceeding establish by the employer they meet with the employer and the employee do everything in the grievance and they now fire that employee under your reading that be not institute a proceeding then we have to address your second question not the first you be say the oral would not work in there would it work if they institute a proceeding orally and the proceeding require itself to start orally so we should give it no weight at all not even skidmore how long have collective bargaining arbitration agreement be in existence how old do you think that when congress write or cause to be institute any proceed under or relate to this chapter that they intend to exclude that proceed and intend to exclude people who testify in that proceed about a violation of the statute can you point me to something in the act that define proceeding relate the word proceeding relate to this chapter as limit only to government proceeding then we be back to if congress mean file any complaint either oral or in writing I be ask a different question which be that congress s intent be not to protect a worker who publicly take an oath in front of an arbitrator and testify about a violation of law that they would not have consider that retaliatory under the statute that go to your adversary s first argument or second argument where he say when this act be pass for all of those people they would never have think of go to their employer because the work ethos at the time be that those employee could not complain to their employer they would always naturally go to the government how do you answer that how do you disprove that point that historically at the time this be pass in that there be a number of those employee who as a regular course of their business file complaint with their employer as oppose to the government I be sorry ,254.11000000000004,Roberts Court,"Oct 13, 2010",Kevin Kasten,Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corporation,09-834,"Mar 22, 2010","Mar 22, 2011",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2010,AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"What's the difference, then, with the act that you are positing? A State comes in -- or I should ask: Is there no difference between a State saying these terms in a contract are unconscionable, making the petitioner always pay the fees and making him or her arbitrate in a different State -- that is unconscionable -- or a general rule of State law that says in a contract of adhesion the stronger party can't impose undue cost or expenses on the other side to vindicate their rights, whether it's in litigation and/or arbitration. In your mind, there is no difference between those two things, between these two approaches to the issue? But they're not requiring-- --But they're not requiring arbitration-- --They are not saying you have to arbitration -- class actions in all arbitration proceedings. They are identifying a class of cases in which they pursue the State, who's their own sovereign, and the savings clause in the FAA permits them in law or equity to set forth rules to say in this subset of cases there is a substantive right being affected. That is different than rules that are looking at procedures and setting uniform procedures in both. How do we draw the line between a law that says discovery has to happen in arbitration, and one that says a -- in a contract of adhesion, if the superior party retains the right to do discovery but tells the inferior party, you can't? And a State says, that's unconscionable. So then we have -- we have to serve as reviewers of State law? We have to look at what the States are doing in -- to interpret their own laws? Then, Mr. Pincus-- Counsel, I've asked your adversary this question and I'm not sure yet what his answer is, so I'm asking you it. How would you propose to distinguish between facially neutral contract law defenses that implicitly discriminate against arbitration and those that do not? What's the test you would use to tell the difference between the two? Because obviously there are subterfuges that some legal systems could use to address themselves just to arbitration. So how do we tell the difference? How do we test that? I mean, other than -- I don't want to look through legislative history and determine whether some committee person said something that sounds like subterfuge.

2010,Fowler v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Going -- going back to Justice Alito's question: Obviously, the statute's not written to say the intent to preclude a witness from talking to law enforcement officials. If it were that simple about a Federal crime, then it wouldn't matter whether it was likely, possible. All that we have -- know is that the witness was -- that the killing was intended to stop them from talking to law enforcement, period. So, clearly, (g) has to have a meaning different than merely stopping from someone talking to a law enforcement officer, because there has to be some connection to that officer being a Federal officer. So, going back to Justice Alito's question, how do you define the intent? What is the defendant's intent? If he doesn't have to know it's a Federal officer, what does he have to intend? Articulate what the intent has to be. Does the defendant have to know that? That's my question. Does he have to intend to stop the witness from communicating this information to someone that's related to either a Federal judge or a Federal law enforcement agent? When did they go to the Federal authorities after 2002? When did they go to the Federal authorities after 2002? I have one last one, the plain error question. Neither your brief -- I think you're taking the position that simply because we granted cert, we've accepted there's a plain error; is that your position? Because you haven't really defended against a finding of plain error. So we're really -- granted cert to give an advisory opinion? Because if there's not plain error, how do we reverse this court below? So, what you're suggesting is that we announce the standard, hopefully different than the courts below for your sake, and then remand to then let the court apply the new standard? And if it's not, what's the other? How could we do that unless we found there was plain error? And how can we say there's plain error when this question has vexed so many courts? I have to say to you that even if a bright-line rule is announced, the real work begins in deciding what evidence is sufficient to meet that burden. What do you see-- --I'm a little bit confused. Tell me exactly why you see a difference between ""realistically likely"" or ""reasonably possible"". Tell me -- tell me what fine line exists between those two and what quantum of evidence more you would need under one as opposed to the other. Tell me what the difference in proof would look like. ""Likely"" is proven? Okay. Well, but you still had to prove, didn't you, or wouldn't you have a measure of obligation to have a witness get up on the stand and say, the FBI always looks at bank robberies? In the absence of that, aren't we asking the jury to speculate that, merely because it can be a Federal crime -- bank robbery can be both a State and a Federal -- that it's reasonably possible it would go, not everything you yourself said not everything goes to the Federal government, so-- --I'm not sure I understand your answer to Justice Kagan's hypothetical. We -- we -- there's no proof that this particular officer who was shot was going to pick up the phone to the FBI. He may have overheard this. He would have called his fellow officers, and somebody, probably his supervisor, or the DA's office was going to make the decision whether to call the FBI. So, how is that different from the cemetery caretaker, who is going to call it in probably to 9-1-1, and he doesn't particularly have an idea of who's going to get involved or not because it's really not his issue. Why is there a difference between those two situations? And isn't the question, going back to what Justice Breyer asked, was, what's the likelihood that this is going to get investigated by the Federal Government? Why is it reasonably possible? Anything is reasonably possible -- or almost anything. So I guess then your burden is only to show that it's a Federal offense, because why you need to show anything else because ""reasonably possible"" encompasses every single Federal offense or anything that could be termed a Federal offense. Do you know what the difference was between the State and the Federal penalties? ",go go back to justice alito s question obviously the statute s not write to say the intent to preclude a witness from talk to law enforcement official if it we be that simple about a federal crime then it would not matter whether it be likely possible all that we have know be that the witness be that the killing be intend to stop them from talk to law enforcement period so clearly g have to have a meaning different than merely stop from someone talk to a law enforcement officer because there have to be some connection to that officer be a federal officer so go back to justice alito s question how do you define the intent what be the defendant s intent if he do not have to know it be a federal officer what do he have to intend articulate what the intent have to be do the defendant have to know that that be my question do he have to intend to stop the witness from communicate this information to someone that be relate to either a federal judge or a federal law enforcement agent when do they go to the federal authority after when do they go to the federal authority after i have one last one the plain error question neither your brief i think you be take the position that simply because we grant cert we have accept there be a plain error be that your position because you have not really defend against a finding of plain error so we be really grant cert to give an advisory opinion because if there be not plain error how do we reverse this court below so what you be suggest be that we announce the standard hopefully different than the court below for your sake and then remand to then let the court apply the new standard and if it be not what be the other how could we do that unless we find there be plain error and how can we say there be plain error when this question have vex so many court i have to say to you that even if a bright line rule be announce the real work begin in decide what evidence be sufficient to meet that burden what do you see I be a little bit confused tell me exactly why you see a difference between realistically likely or reasonably possible tell me tell me what fine line exists between those two and what quantum of evidence more you would need under one as oppose to the other tell me what the difference in proof would look like likely be prove okay well but you still have to prove do not you or would not you have a measure of obligation to have a witness get up on the stand and say the fbi always look at bank robbery in the absence of that be not we ask the jury to speculate that merely because it can be a federal crime bank robbery can be both a state and a federal that it be reasonably possible it would go not everything you yourself say not everything go to the federal government so I be not sure i understand your answer to justice kagan s hypothetical we we there be no proof that this particular officer who be shot be go to pick up the phone to the fbi he may have overheard this he would have call his fellow officer and somebody probably his supervisor or the da s office be go to make the decision whether to call the fbi so how be that different from the cemetery caretaker who be go to call it in probably to and he do not particularly have an idea of who be go to get involve or not because it be really not his issue why be there a difference between those two situation and be not the question go back to what justice breyer ask be what be the likelihood that this be go to get investigate by the federal government why be it reasonably possible anything be reasonably possible or almost anything so i guess then your burden be only to show that it be a federal offense because why you need to show anything else because reasonably possible encompass every single federal offense or anything that could be term a federal offense do you know what the difference be between the state and the federal penalty ,277.80000000000007,Roberts Court,"Mar 29, 2011","Charles Andrew Fowler, aka Man",United States,10-5443,"Nov 15, 2010","May 26, 2011",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2010,Connick v. Thompson,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, this is a single incident, and Canton said if you know that a tort is likely to happen without training then one incident is enough. Every prosecutor knows that there can be Brady violations if people are not taught what Brady means, because it's not self-evident in every situation. Correct? All right. So if you know that rookie prosecutors -- and most prosecutors' offices are filled with young ADA's who have just come out of law school. If you know that they are going to meet some situations where the answer is not intuitively known, like that if you get a lab report, you should turn it over, don't you have an obligation, isn't that what the jury said, to train them to turn over lab reports? Now, I know you claim you had that policy. We can talk later about whether or not there was sufficient evidence for the jury to disbelieve that you had that policy or not. That's a sufficiency of the evidence question. But if you know that lab reports have to be turned over, you've conceded it's a Brady violation not to do it, and there was sufficient -- and you had no policy -- I know you are disputing that -- and you had no policy of turning it over, why aren't you responsible for a Canton-like violation? Now what you are suggesting is that for certainty you know that a lawyer's judgment is going to go astray because a particular area of law is that complicated. Your people disagreed -- some of your people disagreed or didn't know whether turning over a lab report was a -- failure to turn over a lab report when you didn't know a defendant's blood type was a Brady violation. That has been conceded in this case, so I accept as a working proposition that they should have known that. What you are suggesting is you get a pass because, even though you know that there's an area of law that a young lawyer is not going to be able to figure out on their own, you fail to train them and you're okay. That that is not the Canton example. That's what you are saying. I understood -- and maybe I'm confused -- that you were arguing that there was no set of circumstances in which a prosecutor could be handled -- could be liable on a theory of failure to train for one incident. That that was the petition. So it doesn't matter what the facts are. The facts that Justice Kagan gave you would never constitute an actionable claim against a prosecutor; is that your position in this case? So what you-- --But that wasn't the question presented to us. You didn't present to us an issue of whether the jury instruction-- --was wrong or not. You see, what I'm trying to figure out is whether your position is that under no circumstance, even the hypothetical that Justice Kagan set forth, could you be charged with a single incident Canton violation. That is your -- your theory? The Brady situation. Well, how do you exercise legal judgment if you don't even know what you are supposed to turn over? That was Justice Ginsburg's question. Wait a minute. What evidence is there that they put this in their hip pocket? There was a disclosure that the evidence existed. Where is the evidence that the defense counsel didn't have access to asking for it? Or asking for it to be tested? Where was that suppressed? And where is the Brady violation for telling a defense attorney, there was a blood sample there, you can test it? So that you are claiming there was suppression of that evidence? Could you please state in simple terms to me what exactly they failed to train these prosecutors to do, that the prosecutors didn't do? What training -- Justice Alito asked it generally, I'm asking specifically -- what is the exact training that was required in this situation that caused the violation in this case? Forget about no Brady training. What -- I think Justice Alito asked this question. What specifically would the training have said or done that would have avoided this Brady violation? Now that seems to suggest that you are claiming that if there was an intentional violation by prosecutors, that that statement would have avoided the prosecutor from doing something he or she knew was illegal. Is that what you are intending? Okay. So tell me. That goes to the sufficiency-- --of whether they had a policy to turn over or -- because it was tested, so there was no Brady violation from the failure to test here. But you see, it was tested. And it was made available to the defense. Turning over -- using the word turning over is ridiculous, because they are not going to physically give it to the defense attorney to go off and do what he wants. They are going to give it to a lab that will establish a chain of custody, et cetera, et cetera. So it was made available. He went to look at it but the looking at it wouldn't have told the defense attorney anything. They had to make it available for testing. He never asked for testing. They did the lab reports. So now we come down to the only failure is in the turning over of this report. Correct? Now what did I just say? The failure to turn over the report. Correct? Never knew it existed? That's-- --But that dooms your case-- if it wasn't an innocent error, if it was an intentional violation of Brady, there is no training that was going to stop him from doing that. ",counsel this be a single incident and canton say if you know that a tort be likely to happen without train then one incident be enough every prosecutor know that there can be brady violation if people be not taught what brady mean because it be not self evident in every situation correct all right so if you know that rookie prosecutor and most prosecutor office be fill with young ada s who have just come out of law school if you know that they be go to meet some situation where the answer be not intuitively know like that if you get a lab report you should turn it over do not you have an obligation be not that what the jury say to train them to turn over lab report now i know you claim you have that policy we can talk later about whether or not there be sufficient evidence for the jury to disbelieve that you have that policy or not that be a sufficiency of the evidence question but if you know that lab report have to be turn over you have concede it be a brady violation not to do it and there be sufficient and you have no policy i know you be dispute that and you have no policy of turn it over why be not you responsible for a canton like violation now what you be suggest be that for certainty you know that a lawyer s judgment be go to go astray because a particular area of law be that complicate your people disagree some of your people disagree or do not know whether turn over a lab report be a failure to turn over a lab report when you do not know a defendant s blood type be a brady violation that have be concede in this case so i accept as a work proposition that they should have know that what you be suggest be you get a pas because even though you know that there be an area of law that a young lawyer be not go to be able to figure out on their own you fail to train them and you be okay that that be not the canton example that be what you be say i understood and maybe I be confuse that you we be argue that there be no set of circumstance in which a prosecutor could be handle could be liable on a theory of failure to train for one incident that that be the petition so it do not matter what the fact be the fact that justice kagan give you would never constitute an actionable claim against a prosecutor be that your position in this case so what you but that be not the question present to us you do not present to us an issue of whether the jury instruction be wrong or not you see what I be try to figure out be whether your position be that under no circumstance even the hypothetical that justice kagan set forth could you be charge with a single incident canton violation that be your your theory the brady situation well how do you exercise legal judgment if you do not even know what you be suppose to turn over that be justice ginsburg s question wait a minute what evidence be there that they put this in their hip pocket there be a disclosure that the evidence exist where be the evidence that the defense counsel do not have access to ask for it or ask for it to be test where be that suppress and where be the brady violation for tell a defense attorney there be a blood sample there you can test it so that you be claim there be suppression of that evidence could you please state in simple term to me what exactly they fail to train these prosecutor to do that the prosecutor do not do what training justice alito ask it generally I be ask specifically what be the exact training that be require in this situation that cause the violation in this case forget about no brady training what i think justice alito ask this question what specifically would the training have say or do that would have avoid this brady violation now that seem to suggest that you be claim that if there be an intentional violation by prosecutor that that statement would have avoid the prosecutor from do something he or she know be illegal be that what you be intend okay so tell me that go to the sufficiency of whether they have a policy to turn over or because it be test so there be no brady violation from the failure to test here but you see it be test and it be make available to the defense turn over use the word turning over be ridiculous because they be not go to physically give it to the defense attorney to go off and do what he want they be go to give it to a lab that will establish a chain of custody et cetera et cetera so it be make available he go to look at it but the look at it would not have tell the defense attorney anything they have to make it available for test he never ask for test they do the lab report so now we come down to the only failure be in the turning over of this report correct now what do i just say the failure to turn over the report correct never know it exist that be but that doom your case if it be not an innocent error if it be an intentional violation of brady there be no training that be go to stop him from do that ,361.7599999999998,Roberts Court,"Oct 6, 2010","Harry F.

2010,"Los Angeles County, CA v. Humphries",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"--ignore the injunction, can you go to the State and force the State to -- in that circumstance, to get someone to issue the license on your behalf? Or the municipality. I misspoke. So what you are saying is that a State agent or a municipality can continue to ignore a constitutional violation until, what -- you are denied the license five times? How many times do you have to show that you are not getting that license that you are entitled to? All right. So what do you do with ANCRA section 11178(a)(2), which tells you that the municipality is responsible for the accuracy, completeness, and retention of the reports sent to the State? It's not your policy to ignore your obligation and not figure out what to do about the retentions of improperly submitted names? But that's what it is charged with doing. It is charged with the responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, and retention of these reports. So if you're charged with the accuracy, completeness, and retention of the reports, why shouldn't you be responsible for the failure to maintain accurate reports? Well, that's your adversary's argument, which is by this lawsuit, you have been told that there's something wrong. It seems pretty natural that a report would be kept on the registry. That is then declared just plain wrong. The court has said there is no foundation whatsoever for the accuracy of what's in that report, and you have failed to establish a procedure to remove the name. Why aren't you viable under Monell? Who would they sue to do that? As I am reading ANCRA, it makes the California Department of Justice only the repository of reports. So who -- who do they sue in the State to-- Counsel, could you stop talking in the abstract-- --and give me an example. Give me an example of a situation where a State official under Ex Parte Young has been held to have violated the Constitution where a Monell finding had not been applied already. Exactly. No. I was trying to do just an analogy in terms of -- because one of his arguments has been that Ex Parte Young doesn't have, inherently, a Monell requirement. I -- I -- I'm still -- I am sort of asking for a hypothetical and to take it from the abstract. Tell me what's -- here, you define the ongoing violation as the failure to institute procedures, I'm assuming, to remove a name from the registry, correct? That's the ongoing failure that you are alleging entitles you to injunctive relief? Or was it that you thought the city could remove the name? I'm not quite sure what it is that you think -- what was the continuing violation? So to prove a future violation, you have to show that the municipality can do that; correct? Right. So why isn't that a policy, practice, or custom? That's what I'm trying to understand: How-- --their failure or omission could be anything but. Well, they gave you an example. Clerk says I'm not giving marriage license to interracial couples. I think that's constitutional. Clerk resigns and the municipality says we think he was right, that's constitutional. It's not our policy. We didn't really think about it, but we think it's constitutional. You're arguing that because it was the agent who made that decision, was the city had no policy, you can't give injunctive relief ordering the city to give you a license. How is that different from what the Chief Justice proposed, which is, no, we didn't have a policy, but we are going to defend you anyway because we think it's okay. Now you are calling that a policy? They are not going to say that, they are going to say, policy, no policy, we don't even think that way. What he did was okay, we're going to defend that, it's constitutional. And the court says what he did is not constitutional. X has to be done instead. By you, the municipality, even though the agents that you had before was acting on his or her own. So we are now going to have a situation where what you are proposing is that you have to sue the individual actor, get a ruling on the constitutionality of whatever is being done, and then let that suit finish and ask the municipality to perform or not perform, and if it doesn't then you relitigate all these issues? ",ignore the injunction can you go to the state and force the state to in that circumstance to get someone to issue the license on your behalf or the municipality i misspoke so what you be say be that a state agent or a municipality can continue to ignore a constitutional violation until what you be deny the license five time how many time do you have to show that you be not get that license that you be entitle to all right so what do you do with ancra section a which tell you that the municipality be responsible for the accuracy completeness and retention of the report send to the state it be not your policy to ignore your obligation and not figure out what to do about the retention of improperly submit name but that be what it be charge with do it be charge with the responsibility for the accuracy completeness and retention of these report so if you be charge with the accuracy completeness and retention of the report why should not you be responsible for the failure to maintain accurate report well that be your adversary s argument which be by this lawsuit you have be tell that there be something wrong it seem pretty natural that a report would be keep on the registry that be then declare just plain wrong the court have say there be no foundation whatsoever for the accuracy of what be in that report and you have fail to establish a procedure to remove the name why be not you viable under monell who would they sue to do that as i be read ancra it make the california department of justice only the repository of report so who who do they sue in the state to counsel could you stop talk in the abstract and give me an example give me an example of a situation where a state official under ex parte young have be hold to have violate the constitution where a monell find have not be apply already exactly no i be try to do just an analogy in term of because one of his argument have be that ex parte young do not have inherently a monell requirement i i I be still i be sort of ask for a hypothetical and to take it from the abstract tell me what be here you define the ongoing violation as the failure to institute procedure I be assume to remove a name from the registry correct that be the ongoing failure that you be allege entitles you to injunctive relief or be it that you think the city could remove the name I be not quite sure what it be that you think what be the continue violation so to prove a future violation you have to show that the municipality can do that correct right so why be not that a policy practice or custom that be what I be try to understand how their failure or omission could be anything but well they give you an example clerk say I be not give marriage license to interracial couple i think that be constitutional clerk resigns and the municipality say we think he be right that be constitutional it be not our policy we do not really think about it but we think it be constitutional you be argue that because it be the agent who make that decision be the city have no policy you can not give injunctive relief order the city to give you a license how be that different from what the chief justice propose which be no we do not have a policy but we be go to defend you anyway because we think it be okay now you be call that a policy they be not go to say that they be go to say policy no policy we do not even think that way what he do be okay we be go to defend that it be constitutional and the court say what he do be not constitutional x have to be do instead by you the municipality even though the agent that you have before be act on his or her own so we be now go to have a situation where what you be propose be that you have to sue the individual actor get a ruling on the constitutionality of whatever be be do and then let that suit finish and ask the municipality to perform or not perform and if it do not then you relitigate all these issue ,318.12,Roberts Court,"Oct 5, 2010","Los Angeles County, CA",Craig Arthur Humphries et al.,09-350,"Feb 22, 2010","Nov 30, 2010",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2010,Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I don't think; is that answering Justice Kagan's question? One of the studies, the Anderson study, says that the effect of violence is the same for a Bugs Bunny episode as it is for a violent video. So can the legislature now, because it has that study, say we can outlaw Bugs Bunny? There are people who would say that a cartoon has very little social value; it's entertainment, but not much else. This is entertainment. I'm not suggesting that I like this video, the one at issue that you provided the five-minute clip about. To me, it's not entertaining, but that's not the point. To some it may well be. How is this any different than what we said we don't do in the First Amendment field in Stevens, where we said we don't look at a category of speech and decide that some of it has low value? We decide whether a category of speech has a historical tradition of being regulated. Now, other than some State statutes that you point to, some of which are very clearly the same as those that we struck down in Wynn, where is the tradition of regulating violence? Could you get rid of rap music? Have you heard some of the lyrics of some of the rap music, some of the original violent songs that have been sung about killing people and about other violence directed to them? Could the State-- --Why isn't that obscene in the sense that you are using the word, or deviant? What's the earliest statute? What's the earliest statute and how much enforcement was-- --Can I have a point of clarification? Justice Ginsburg talked about the labeling parts of this act. The circuit court struck those portions of the act. You have not challenged that ruling. There are two sections to the act. One is a criminal act for selling to a minor, and the other is a requirement that you label in a certain way each video. The district court said both were -- I think the circuit court said both were unconstitutional, correct? And your brief has not addressed the labeling requirements at all. That's an interesting concession on your part, that the labeling doesn't have a need separate from the restriction on sale. I would have thought that if you wanted a lesser restriction, that you would have promoted labeling as a reasonable strict scrutiny restriction to permit the control of sale of these materials to minors; but you seem to have given up that argument altogether. Well, you have conceded it by not appealing it. But we're not -- your case on labeling rises and falls on the sale to minors? But they have plenty of evidence that-- --So when you say-- --Mr. Smith, how can you say that? There is plenty of proof that -- that children are going into stores and buying these games despite the voluntary rating system, despite the voluntary retailer restraint by some. There is still proof out there and an abundance of it that kids are buying the games. And there is proof that some parents, as well intentioned as they may or may not be, have not been able to supervise that. So I -- starting from the proposition that there is a problem, it's a compelling State need, why are you arguing that there is no solution that the State could use to address that problem? But it's still about 20 percent of sales are going to kids. Would a video game that portrayed a Vulcan as opposed to a human being, being maimed and tortured, would that be covered by the act? So if the video producer says this is not a human being, it's an android computer simulated person, then all they have to do is put a little artificial feature on the creature and they could sell the video game? So what happens when the character gets maimed, head chopped off and immediately after it happens they spring back to life and they continue their battle. Is that covered by your act? Because they haven't been maimed and killed forever. Just temporarily. Isn't that feedback to Justice Scalia's question?

Well, I do think -- I do think, counsel, that that major change doesn't have to be the way you describe it. The difference between either contemporary notice and/or 15-day notice versus 45 is a significant change. And so it doesn't need to have been precipitated solely by a decision that the old rule, if it's as your adversary advocates it, didn't exist. What's left of their arguments if we decide that the statute is ambiguous, the official staff commentary is ambiguous? What is left? Is Auer deference then required? To the amicus brief at least? We can talk about whether the ANPRs or the unofficial commentaries are due deference. But what are we left with if we think there is ambiguity?

2010,Borough of Duryea v. Guarnieri,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"What kind of case, hypothetically, would qualify under your theory as a petitioning case to the sovereign?

You have to from -- you can't invite a question as to whether the sovereign is responsible until you litigate the issue. So what is the -- addressing Justice Scalia's question to you, what would qualify as a petition to the employer as opposed to a petition to the sovereign and why? Those are clear cases. I was asking the flip. How much of your argument is premised on the fact that there was an alternative mechanism to the court system available. Meaning let's assume there wasn't a collective bargaining agreement, let's assume there wasn't a State law protection, all of the items that you mention in your brief as existing to resolve disputes, that the only avenue for redress were the courts. So where would that put your argument? Putting it aside. You -- you were talking about constitutionalizing a grievance process.

How about if they don't? That's my point. Then what happens to the Third Circuit's definition? Counselor, your client won everything in his collective bargaining grievance.

2010,Abbott v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I'm sorry. You keep saying that you are not reading anything into the statute under your interpretation, but you are. You are limiting the -- the ""any other provision of law"" to any other provision of law specified in the charging -- in the counts of conviction, correct? So you -- you said to Justice Alito that you weren't reading anything in, but you are. You are reading into it that the other provision of law to refer to counts of conviction at sentencing, correct? All right. So why is that read-in logical, meaning it's giving no extra punishment for the possession of a firearm? Which is, I think, Justice Ginsburg's. Explain how, because you just said to Justice Scalia that if the mandatory minimum is in a separate charging instrument, then it doesn't affect you at all. It only affects you if the count is in a count of conviction at sentencing. So what in the language of 924(c) sets forth that limitation? Well, their ""otherwise provided by law"" could be Federal, State laws. It could be in the indictment, not in the indictment. You are proposing that we limit this somehow, but I want to see what the language is that you are relying upon to limit it. In relationship to what? Isn't that the Government's argument, which is that you have to say in relationship to something, whether it's the indictment or, as the Government would have it, in relationship to the possession or carrying of a firearm? Why isn't that the more natural reading? Justice Breyer is reading a bit what your co-counsel is advocating, what Mr. Abbott is arguing? No? 930(c): A person who kills any person in the course of bringing a firearm into a Federal facility shall be punished as provided in sections setting forth minimums for murder and manslaughter. So it would also have an effect in 930(c), no? I wasn't sure why it didn't list 930, but-- --I know, but its brief does two formulations. It says-- --anything that affects 924(c); and then in other places in its brief it says the -- ""the ""except"" clause refers to any higher minimum sentence for possessing, using or carrying a firearm in relationship to a drug or -- drug offense or a crime of violence. "" Those are two different formulations. I am focusing on the second formulation. --charging-- Counsel, could I just ask one simple question, the one I started with earlier, which was, which of the two statements are you advocating, that the 924(c) explicitly, or are you saying the ""except"" clause -- and I'm quoting from your brief, in two different places -- ""The ""except"" clause refers to a higher minimum sentence for possessing, using a firearm in relationship to a crime of violence or a drug offense? "" All right. If that's the case, your adversary just said, Mr. Abbott's attorney just said, that you don't believe that section 924(c)(1)(A) is trumped by 924(c)(1)(B) or by 18 U.S.C. section 930(c). Is his allegation correct or is he wrong? Okay. I'm sorry. So that if he discharges a firearm and it says it is a sentence of not less than 10 years and he -- and that firearm is also a short barrelled rifle with a 10 year minimum, does he get 10 years or does he get 20 years? How? So if it's a machine gun where there is a 30-year minimum, does he get 40 or 30? What do you do with 930(c)? Don't leave without answering my question. But your answer to me was, you read the ""except"" clause as applying to any higher minimum sentence for possessing, using or carrying a firearm in relationship to a drug offense or crime of violence. Isn't killing a person a crime of violence? And isn't bringing of a firearm into a Federal facility the carrying of a firearm? No, but I'm still trying to understand your position, which is -- I read what you said to me the 930(c) and I couldn't figure out why you didn't list it. How? A person who kills any person-- --So how is your reading different from Mr. Abbott's?

So tell me what specific steps outside of this order should have been given time to be implemented because the receiver has basically said, “I've tried, and the small progress we made has been reversed because the population just keeps growing. So we can never get ahead of the problem.” So slow down from the rhetoric and give me concrete – -- details about what the least restrictive means would have been other than to say, throw it back to a receiver and special master who are saying, we don't have a solution outside of reducing overcrowding. Oh, Counsel that was one statement years ago. Is that is all you are relying on? That may be your weakest argument. Tell me -- give me concrete steps that are least -- less restrictive. So you go back to that panel because it invited you to. It said if circumstances change, come back. So it's possible that within the two-year period, you are going to hit the mark, if you -- that's what -- -- that's what the three-judge panel said, which is if you implement most of the proposals being made, you are likely to hit the mark. So what you are saying is you are going to do it and if you don't, they invited you to come back and -- you really don't think that if you hit 140 percentage, that the court is going to order an immediate release of the 2.5 percent over the limit it set? It's going to ask you, “What have you put into place to reach that level over what additional period of time?” So what are we fighting about? Are we fighting about that the plan was wrong or are we fighting about that you are angry that you were told to do it in two years -- in 22 years, as opposed to do it in 25 years? Is that -- is that what you're objecting to? Can you do it in 5 years? Well, the best interest of the State of California, isn't it to deliver adequate constitutional care to the people that it incarcerates? That's a constitutional obligation. So when are you going to get to that? What are you going to avoid the needless deaths that were reported in this record? When are you going to avoid or get around people sitting in their feces for days in a dazed state? When are you going to get to a point where you are going to deliver care that is going to be adequate? Counsel, did you-- Counsel, this issue about evidence, did you proffer to the judge anywhere in this record what the additional evidence it was that you wanted to show? I know that the decrease in suicides happened post-trial, so you couldn't have proffered that pretrial. But you are from the prisons. I presume that you could have yourself without discovery set forth or proffer for the court that says, “We had a wait time between diagnosis and treatment that was 60 days, 90 days, 120 days in the past and we have reduced that down now to two weeks or whatever the reality is. Why didn't you -- you keep saying we were blocked. Except that the district court invited you to proffer that evidence that went to the appropriateness of the remedy, so you didn't have to proffer it. It viewed you as saying, we are no longer violating, constitutionally violating the Eighth Amendment. Instead it said, “We will take whatever you have to proffer to show that the remedy is inappropriate.” Are you talking about current figures or past? Tell us the date of the figures? That's what I thought. How do you address your adversary's point that the adequacy of a remedy can't be measured unless you measure the state of the situation at the time the remedy is imposed? Could you give us the record? Could -- Counsel -- Counsel, didn't the court -- Counsel -- Counsel. Didn't – Counsel-- I have several questions but I'm not sure why -- you have not been responding to Justice -- to the Chief Justice. Didn't the district court discuss different safe ways of reducing the population? And said, we are not imposing them because we want the State to do -- to choose among them? As I've looked at the State's final plan, I thought that they had in fact not only accepted all of the recommendations, but they added a couple of additional remedies that the court had not suggested? Is it a fair statement that the district, that the three judge panel was saying, if you do these things that's their finding, you can do it without affecting public safety, wasn't that what they were saying? The second more important question was going back to something that Justice Scalia asked you, which was, you made the statement that no one was stopped from proffering evidence about prison conditions up till two months before the trial. So what evidence was excluded? What point is the other side making that they were excluded from making? Just the experts. The expert who gave the 145? The expert who gave the 145? Let's go to the one who's used the 145 figure. He was a what? And did he say that 145 you could deliver healthcare? So should the court have said 2 years for everything but construction? Wouldn't that have been a more narrowly tailored remedy? Except that they -- -- that there was going to be no construction adequate, because there was no money. I'm sorry, what page was that? I'm sorry; I don't know what the declaration said. Is the actual declaration in the record somewhere? All right. So why didn't you give the court that as your plan? The court gave you absolute discretion to implement the plan that you wanted. It said we don't want to do facility by facility, because we want you to figure out where you need to implement. So, your client didn't do that, why, either in your 5-year plan or in your 2-year plan? ",excuse me could you tell me from your brief i just have not understand what the alternative step be the court below talk about some proposal like construction and say the legislature have strike them down there be the fiscal crisis have get bad so construction be really not an option i do not see how you wait for an option that do not exist they talk about hire more staff but the conclusion be that even if you maximize the staff you do not have the facility to add more staff which be what you need to cure the constitutional violation so tell me what specific step outside of this order should have be give time to be implement because the receiver have basically say I have try and the small progress we make have be reverse because the population just keep grow so we can never get ahead of the problem so slow down from the rhetoric and give me concrete detail about what the least restrictive mean would have be other than to say throw it back to a receiver and special master who be say we do not have a solution outside of reduce overcrowd oh counsel that be one statement year ago be that be all you be rely on that may be your weak argument tell me give me concrete step that be least less restrictive so you go back to that panel because it invite you to it say if circumstance change come back so it be possible that within the two year period you be go to hit the mark if you that be what that be what the three judge panel say which be if you implement most of the proposal be make you be likely to hit the mark so what you be say be you be go to do it and if you do not they invite you to come back and you really do not think that if you hit percentage that the court be go to order an immediate release of the percent over the limit it set it be go to ask you what

tell to do it in two year in year as oppose to do it in year be that be that what you be object to can you do it in year well the best interest of the state of california be not it to deliver adequate

when be you go to avoid or get around people sit in their feces for day in a dazed state when be you go to get to a point where you be go to deliver care that be go to be adequate counsel do you

2010,"CSX Transportation, Inc. v. Alabama Department of Revenue",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"--in the legislative record? Excuse me. May I pose a hypothetical so that I understand? And I think it follows up on what Justice Alito was saying. Let's assume all taxes are equal between water carriers and railroads, except there is an excise tax: 4 percent on the railroads, 2 percent on the water carriers. Everybody else pays 4 percent. On your theory, is that discrimination or not? But this is not an exemption area, so what meaning do you give -- that's what I'm trying to figure out. Are you saying -- what meaning are you giving to discrimination at all, other than -- unless we accept that the class always has to be the commercial class? So if there's 100 businesses, where does the line between singling out the railroad get drawn? When they exempt 98? When they exempt 97? When they exempt 95, or is it at 80? Where do we draw the singling out? If the State says the general tax is 4 percent, but everybody -- but how many are exempted? What sense would there be for Congress to use the word 4 percent like everyone else, but their competitors, for no reason other than that the State wants to favor the water carrier, is only paying 2 percent? What -- what conceivable reason would Congress want that differential to exist? I'm not talking about an exemption. I'm talking about a rate difference. So to answer that question, you are telling us that we have to define what discrimination means? It's not quite -- it's not quite that. You forget the other part of the test, which is without a reason. Now, the other side hasn't defined what a legitimate reason would be. And that's a separate inquiry. But if there is a -- some form of legitimate reason to treat people differently, I think the other side is saying that's okay. In their particular facts of their case. I mean, that's what they have to come up and explain to us, what's the -- what's the defining principle of acceptable or unacceptable different treatment, because it can't be -- you're right, logically, it can't be most favored taxpayer status. Well, so far, yes, unless they can give-- --I'm having a problem. I thought as you argued in your brief that you were only arguing that States can tax-exempt, but you are asking us to rule more broadly to say that States can treat -- impose taxes differently. So it doesn't really matter that it's a tax exemption; you are just saying if the tax is a positive imposition or a negative one, taking someone out, it doesn't matter. So give me a definition of discriminate. Give me your working -- it can't -- as I started to ask your adversary, it can't be most favored taxpayer status. True? So what constitutes an adequate justification? Well-- --Stop. You are going to grant an exemption; you are going to treat someone differently because you are favoring them for a reason. People don't -- States don't do these willy-nilly. Either some enterprises or some individuals, like the 85-year-old widow, you are sympathetic to her. You want to encourage your water transport, because it's an industry that is nascent in your State and you want it to grow, so it's a pro-competition reason. Are those legitimate? And if those are-- --what isn't? Give me a working principle. What does -- how do you define legitimate and illegitimate, assuming-- --The government reason is always going to be premised on wanting to favor someone for a reason. That is the problem because there were two objectives. One was to promote equality with local businesses and the other to promote equality-- --Right.

2010,Henderson v. Shinseki,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel -- I'm sorry. I'm not sure why Congress would have actually known the difference that we established in Bowles, because when it passed this statute, it was before Bowles, wasn't it? So what to read of its knowledge of Bowles, whether it meant jurisdiction or not, is a bit of a fiction, isn't it? So what's the rule? Justice Scalia said those seem to establish a sensible, clear rule, which is if Congress uses the word ""notice of appeal"", it intends a jurisdictional restriction. That appears to be the rule that Justice Scalia articulated. What would be your rule or test now to determine Congress's purpose? What -- what of our cases would you point to that establishes different-- --I'm not sure what that distinction is. I'm sorry.

2010,Walker v. Martin,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"So basically you are taking the position or you are conceding that the California courts are not consistent in their application of the timeliness rule? Your brief doesn't even try to defend that position. Are you conceding that there is inconsistent application of the rule? Well -- I might be speaking for her, but I thought that the Habeas Corpus Resource Center brief showed that the court, the California court, did reach some cases where an explanation had not been proffered. And so it can't be just a simple rule, that if you don't proffer an explanation you won't get heard. So what's the next step in that? Why do they reach some and not others? How could it be complex when there is no justification offered? Well, they pointed to a certain number of cases that were 5 years or above in delay where no justification was offered, and in some they reached the merits and in others they applied a procedural bar. So how is that consistent? So how do we know that the California court just thinks that the Federal question is too hard and it doesn't want to reach it? It may be meritorious. How do we know they are not applying the decision to reach the merits on an arbitrary and capricious basis or one that seeks to avoid hard Federal questions? But claims here-- --I'm a little bit confused by your response to Justice Scalia. I thought from your brief that you were positing that there was no claim of inconsistent application of the rule that could ever survive. Let's assume for the sake of argument the following hypothetical, and probably not far off the mark. Litigants who don't know the law, who claim they are not educated in it, say that they have just learned about a new California case that gives them a ground to challenge their prior sentence. And the litigants learn about the case anywhere between 3 and 6 months of the issuance of the case by the supreme court. A dozen litigants apply for this discretionary review and half of them are granted review and half are not. Half of them get a correction of the sentence and half of them don't. There is no difference between them that's discernible. They each just claim ignorance. Is that a case where someone would be out of luck, and why, for a claim of inconsistent application? Getting time-barred. Some are time-barred; some-- --Exactly. No. Some -- all of them are within that small framework of 3 to 6 months from the time the supreme court decision was issued. They all claimed they just learned of it and filed immediately, and some are getting relief and some are not. Is that an inconsistent application that would be cognizable under your view of the rule as it should be? It does. I'm sorry. What? Well, that's the issue. Which is: What rule do you want us to impose and how does that rule capture that case? You are not answering my question. But it doesn't answer why inconsistent application among similarly situated individuals should not provide an avenue of relief. 5 years is different. I'm talking about treatment of similarly situated individuals differently. Oh, I don't disagree with you. So that the question I have for your adversary is whether or not he can point to any case where a litigant who proffered an -- something that was evident on the trial record and on the appellate record was ever granted a merits review after 5 years. Because I don't see them proffering any case that shows that. But -- and I think that may be your argument. Well, but what did you present below, or what has Habeas Corpus Resource Center presented? A case with a 5-year delay where the claimed errors are apparent on the trial record and the appellate record, and no justification for the delay is proffered. Those are the three seminal facts that go to the requirements of Robbins and the other Supreme Court -- other California Supreme Court cases. Do you have one case that's similar where the court went to the merits? No. Was that someone who made the claim based on the trial and appellate record with no justification? Uh-huh. So is the solution for California to say, if you delay more than a year from when you should have known you are barred, except we will excuse it for any number of reasons? That would be a regularly and consistently applied rule in your mind? That would be enough? And pro se litigants who don't know deadlines generally are going to live with knowing that, what? ",so basically you be take the position or you be concede that the california court be not consistent in their application of the timeliness rule your brief do not even try to defend that position be you concede that there be inconsistent application of the rule well i might be speak for her but i think that the habeas corpus resource center brief show that the court the california court do reach some case where an explanation have not be proffer and so it can not be just a simple rule that if you do not proffer an explanation you will not get heard so what be the next step in that why do they reach some and not others how could it be complex when there be no justification offer well they point to a certain number of case that we be year or above in delay where no justification be offer and in some they reach the merit and in others they apply a procedural bar so how be that consistent so how do we know that the california court just think that the federal question be too hard and it do not want to reach it it may be meritorious how do we know they be not apply the decision to reach the merit on an arbitrary and capricious basis or one that seek to avoid hard federal question but claim here I be a little bit confuse by your response to justice scalia i think from your brief that you we be posit that there be no claim of inconsistent application of the rule that could ever survive let us assume for the sake of argument the following hypothetical and probably not far off the mark litigant who do not know the law who claim they be not educate in it say that they have just learn about a new california case that give them a ground to challenge their prior sentence and the litigant learn about the case anywhere between and month of the issuance of the case by the supreme court a dozen litigant apply for this discretionary review and half of them be grant review and half be not half of them get a correction of the sentence and half of them do not there be no difference between them that be discernible they each just claim ignorance be that a case where someone would be out of luck and why for a claim of inconsistent application get time bar some be time bar some exactly no some all of them be within that small framework of to month from the time the supreme court decision be issue they all claim they just learn of it and file immediately and some be get relief and some be not be that an inconsistent application that would be cognizable under your view of the rule as it should be it do I be sorry what well that be the issue which be what rule do you want us to impose and how do that rule capture that case you be not answer my question but it do not answer why inconsistent application among similarly situate individual should not provide an avenue of relief year be different I be talk about treatment of similarly situate individual differently oh i do not disagree with you so that the question i have for your adversary be whether or not he can point to any case where a litigant who proffer an something that be evident on the trial record and on the appellate record be ever grant a merit review after year because i do not see them proffer any case that show that but and i think that may be your argument well but what do you present below or what have habeas corpus resource center present a case with a year delay where the claimed error be apparent on the trial record and the appellate record and no justification for the delay be proffer those be the three seminal fact that go to the requirement of robbins and the other supreme court other california supreme court case do you have one case that be similar where the court go to the merit no be that someone who make the claim base on the trial and appellate record with no justification uh huh so be the solution for california to say if you delay more than a year from when you should have know you be bar except we will excuse it for any number of reason that would be a regularly and consistently apply rule in your mind that would be enough and pro se litigant who do not know deadline generally be go to live with knowing that what ,355.27000000000015,Roberts Court,"Nov 29, 2010","James Walker, Warden, et al.",Charles W.

2010,Bullcoming v. New Mexico,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, there are different types of hearsay involved here or different types of statements. There's the report itself, which was Exhibit 1 that was introduced, and it has certain certifications by the analyst, that he followed certain procedures, et cetera. I'm assuming that you're claiming that those -- those are the Confrontation Clause violations, that exhibit itself, because it is attesting or certifying to something. The witness is not at trial here. Well, that's where I want-- --That -- the ""also"" is what I summarized in saying that he followed certain procedures, that it was in accordance with law, et cetera. Right. All right. Now -- if I might just finish my question. Let's assume that the raw data, the graphs that were made, were reviewed by a separate witness, and he reviewed the data and says, this data shows that the blood level concentration was.21, or two-point whatever it was. Would that violate the Confrontation Clause, using the raw data itself? The printout from the machine. That wasn't introduced here; am I correct? All right. But let's assume-- --Let's assume he just took the raw data at trial. I know we now have a chain of custody, and someone will have to prove that this is the data related-- --to Mr. Bullcoming. But if that expert then read that data and testified that this was of a certain amount or percentage of alcohol, would that violate the Confrontation Clause? What part-- --What part do you see as testimonial or not? What can an outside expert look at? Well, I -- that-- --There's two different issues: one, what can be introduced into evidence, which is the reports themselves; and what can he or she testify to is a different question. That's a form of evidence. And so that's the line I'm trying to get you to describe for me, which is, when does that testimony become a violation of the Confrontation Clause? Let's assume the hypothetical I proffered. I'm sorry, could you tell me what that means? Why is it different than the affidavit? It's certified, and my understanding of the dictionary meaning of certification is that that's an attestation as to the truth of the statements contained therein. That's the common definition. So I'm assuming it's the equivalent of an affidavit. So how is it different than the Melendez-Diaz lab report? Tell me why not. Can any-- --I'm sorry. He's not simply looking at a number and putting it on a report. He's certifying to certain things. He's certifying to following certain steps, that the evidence wasn't tampered with. He's certifying that he's complied with all the requirements of New Mexico law with respect to the report, so he's just not copying a number. Isn't the difference between those two documents is that one was prepared primarily for the purposes -- this lab report, for prosecution purposes, and the birth certificate is not prepared for that? It's prepared to mark the birth of a person, then it's used for many other purposes besides trial; is that correct? So tell me what makes this certificate not primarily for the purpose of use in the prosecution of an individual? Would they have tested this blood if -- if it wasn't to prosecute him? Does he do any testing except for the police? Who else do they test for? So why did you give the data to the analyst at trial? If there wasn't a more persuasive power in the lab certification, why didn't you just have the new expert look at the printout from the graph and say, this is what it says? That's that as well. Don't you introduce the lab report because it -- it gives more credence to the reliability of the result?

2010,Sykes v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, do you know if Indiana has an enhancement for convictions, sentencing enhancement of any kind, for conviction that have an element of risk of harm to others? So it's possible that there is a -- there's a use of the difference between the two categories that might not be implicated in this case, but may lay the foundation for an enhancement later? In your brief you take issue with the government's definition of ""aggressive"", but would you give us yours? How would you define it and on what basis? Counsel, have you done or looked at -- not every burglary has a risk of harm to another or results in harm to another. The general definition of burglary is entering without permission and intent to commit a crime, and generically the crime doesn't have to be physical injury to others. Yet ACCA defines burglary as a qualifying crime of violence. It's measuring risk, not by the elements of that crime, but by something else, by some measure of incidents in which violence might occur. So how is that different than the government's argument here and the question that Justice Breyer asked you, which was: It is true, potentially there's some forms of fleeing that might not pose a risk of injury, but statistically there's a large number of incidents in which violence follows. So how is that different than burglary? That's really my question. What -- it can't be that the elements have to pose a risk of injury, because burglary doesn't do that. So what -- how do we measure it? So if you're not doing that, that's my question: Where do we draw the line? Where do we draw the line? I think that was what Justice Breyer was trying to ask you earlier, which is: When do we say that, as in burglary, that some risk is more likely to follow than not in a particular type of crime? That ignores the in-kind requirement of Begay, because you seem to be confusing the risk of violence with the in-kind inquiry, and that's where I'm trying -- I would like you to concentrate a little bit on, which is in burglary the defendant is breaking into generally a place and going without permission, with an intent to commit a crime. How is that comparable to merely not stopping when a police officer tells you not to stop? How is that an in-kind-- --What you're doing is saying I'm not -- you're not even saying I'm not stopping, you're just driving away. Now, how is that-- --But that's the risk of-- --That -- that -- that is all the risk question, and you're confusing the police actions with the defendant's, because you're talking about the defendant responding to a police pursuit. So what -- what is in the act of the crime that makes it in-kind to burglary? I concentrate on burglary because the others don't-- --James -- James predated Begay. So-- --I'm a little confused by what you said and what point you're making. You don't think that (B) is a lesser included of (A)? Is that -- no, that (A) is a lesser included of (B)? You can't commit (B) without committing (A) first. (B) has just one additional element, but all of the elements of (A) are part of the elements of (B), so how can it not be a lesser included? Could you succinctly tell me how this is any less purposeful, aggressive, or violent than escape from custody? What's your best answer to why this is just not identical to escape, which is a fleeing-from situation just as this is. Well, here an officer has told you to stop. They're trying to effect custody. I don't know what the aggression or violence is, other than, you know, breaking a window, doing something. It doesn't require, the escape, that you actually injure someone to get out. It's just that you run away.

Department of the Navy,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"But there was a proposal to amend 2-- --And it was a conscious decision by Congress not to do 2 to conform to Crooker more generally, but to only pass 7. So there has to be a meaning to the decision to limit the amendment. Counsel, in Rose we talked about a legitimate public purpose in seeking information. I tie my question to Justice Alito's, which is at what point does -- is it legitimate for the public to seek information, internal information relating to the rules and practices of personnel? Can the public seek information that places the community at a severe security risk? Is it possible for us to say that that kind of information, given our line of reasoning in Rose, could not be legitimate public information? Could you tell me what the textual basing for Crooker's ""predominantly internal"" and ""circumvention of agency regulation"" requirements is? Where in the text are those words and how do you create them except through sort of judicial crafting? The problem with that in this case is that it's a mixed document. It is predominantly for internal use, but not exclusively. So how do you square that with the words ""related solely to internal""? Well, the case summaries there were internal solely. They were created only for purposes of the agency's honor code review or discipline review. And yet we ordered it disclosed. We created an exception to the plain language of the rule, it seems to me. Oh, I agree. But I think the distinction it made was that it's only internal rules and practices of the agency, personnel agency, if the public has no legitimate interest in it. Well, that begs, I think Justice Scalia's question. One could argue that everything that the agency develops except rules telling the public how to come to the agency with a complaint, et cetera -- virtually everything will govern either the internal personnel practices or the agency's practices vis-a-vis the public. So basically anything that the agency uses to craft its internal employee practices and rules gets swept up as private, as internal? If -- if-- --So you are taking out the records related to personnel and not making it a condition of the disclosure. You are saying if any document circumvents the agency's functioning, that is exempted. You are not tying -- that's where I'm-- --How do the documents that the agency reviews to determine and craft its internal rules and practices fall under the rubric of being related to, solely related to, personnel practices and rules?

These were 3 clinical doctors in this area, one of them you knew poised to go to a society meeting to make this allegation. Doesn't it make a difference who the reports are coming from and what the substance of those reports may do to your product? Counsel, you got cert granted on a limited question, and the limited question was whether in a complaint that alleges only adverse reports can you prove materiality and scienter without proving statistical importance. That's the question presented. Justice Kagan started with the point that the FDA doesn't require that. It requires just reasonable evidence of a connection, not statistical. Many of the amici here have done a wonderful job of explaining why statistical importance can't be a measure because it depends on the nature of the study at issue. So given all of that -- and even in your brief, in a footnote, you answered the question by saying, no, we can't establish that rule as an absolute, because there are additional factors that could prove materiality and scienter. So you've already answered the question presented. Are we down to what Justice Scalia asked you, which is: We got a no to the question: Are the facts in this case enough? I don't know why we would have granted cert on that, but you presented a different question presented. Given the question presented, is the answer no? And if not, why not? Can I just interrupt a second? This wasn't an FDA-approved drug. So there weren't any adverse reports in the legal sense of that word. In the FDA sense. So we're using a misnomer here to start with.

Has that -- the solicitor general's argument. He wasn't actually even talking about causation. He was talking about a statement you made about the company poised to double its growth.

2010,Freeman v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, could you -- maybe it would be easier if you would describe to us the situations you don't think would be based on the guidelines. The Solicitor General claims that since every plea negotiation has to start with the guideline calculation as a starting point for departure and/or consideration by the judge under 6B1, that every C plea agreement would be considered based on. Are you taking that position? All right. So I'll give you a couple of examples, but you give me more. Would a plea agreement that doesn't mention the guidelines at all but picks a sentence within the actual guideline -- is that based on the guideline? All right. And how about one that departs or varies from the guideline, the range, whichever word you want to use? So there -- the Solicitor General is right; there really isn't any situation that you're claiming is not based on? Give me the examples. So from what base does a judge depart downward? From the crack cocaine range or from the downward departure range? So aren't you just asking us to permit district court judges to make up their own C agreement, to decide what the parties would have done in the absence of a higher range? And don't we fall prey to sort of just asking district court judges to create their own agreements? Counsel-- --I don't -- I am not in disagreement with the point you're making, but I think that going back to what had bothered Justice Alito and Justice Scalia on now that the guidelines are not mandatory, is any sentence even under C really based on the agreement? Because even a C agreement has to be approved by the judge. The legal consequence is not the agreement. That doesn't sentence the defendant. It is the judge's decision as to what the sentence should be which he denotes in accepting the agreement that binds. And I think -- I may be making Justice Breyer's argument -- that if under the policy statement and it's clear what the judge did here, if the judge feels bound by the agreement or otherwise to calculate a sentence in the guidelines and impose one in the guidelines, how can you say that the legal effect is not the guideline sentence? --no. Because you're assuming that the agreement was automatically binding on the judge. The judge was always capable of saying at the time of sentence I won't accept the 106. If he had calculated the guidelines and if it turned out that the guidelines called for 240 to 360, he could have said easily no, that is so far outside of the guideline range with no justification that I am not going to accept -- impose the sentence.

Let's assume the contract required the sharing of state secrets and the government then invokes its privilege. Is that a different case than this one in terms of due process? Wouldn't the -- wouldn't the former situation, where it's been made a condition of the contract, require a different treatment than this situation where the government's just saying, if you want to raise a defense that's not part of the contract, then you do what every other litigant with a privilege does -- who a privilege has been invoked against; you proceed with whatever evidence you have. That's usually what happens with other privileges. Wait a minute. Where's the obligation of the government to tell you, build it this way using the technology we already have.

And if there's not, then explain to me why it's unfair, given that you're two sophisticated contracting parties, to say you entered a contract knowing the government could invoke state secrets, it has, and so you bear the risk of that. I mean, you always knew the government could do this. It goes back to my original question is-- --you could have contracted around it. Just before we get there, that showing was based on the court's in camera review of quite a bit of already confidential information, correct? And the nonprivileged information.

2010,Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc.,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, that -- assuming there's some form of privacy that relates to not being harassed because there's certainly legislative record of doctors or groups of doctors testifying to feeling harassed by detailers, if Thompson requires a less restrictive method, why does this have to be an opt-in rather than an opt-out? Because isn't an opt-out I call up and say I, don't want you to have this information? So isn't an opt-out less restrictive? Well, but, given the restrictions on speech, why is that a bad thing? Meaning you don't really intend to tell us that the State couldn't and wouldn't -- just like we got all of that advertising relating to the opt-out on telephone solicitations, virtually every American knew they could do it if they chose. Maybe some didn't, but a vast majority did. You can't really say Vermont's incapable of telling doctors in a mailing or in some public professional magazine, if you want to opt out, here's the number? Mr. Goldstein, I -- I understand your argument and I have a difficulty. Today with the Internet and with computers, there's virtually no privacy individuals have. Any transaction you do could be spread across the world instantaneously, and for the longest time catalogs would sell your name and address to other catalogers, and if you bought one product from one company, you would get a thousand catalogs from 50 million others. Today the industry is policing that, in part to get the State not to intercede, by giving you an opt-out option. And so, if you're a consumer who doesn't want a million catalogs, the industry is giving you the right to opt out, so they don't sell your address. If there is, as I see, some interest that the State legitimately has in protecting that part of the public who says, I entered into this transaction, I didn't really want you to sell my name, I didn't want you to do other things with it, all I did was this transaction, why can't the State say -- there is a difference in my mind between an opt-in and opt-out? Why can't the State say, your desire to enter a transaction in which you're doing just that transaction and not others is something we can protect? I read in one of the briefs that pharmacies were not permitting either patients and/or doctors to opt out; that if a patient came in and said I don't want my doctor's information sold, or a doctor has called the pharmacy and said, I don't want you to sell my information, the pharmacies are not respecting those limitations. So why don't I read this statute as simply doing what the consumer statutes are doing, which is giving people some control outside of the limited transaction that they're engaged in? So what you're saying I think to Justice Kennedy is answering my earlier question by saying the State cannot constitutionally stop the spread of information. So if the State said to the pharmacy, all you can do is fill the prescription, that's what doctors think pharmacies are doing, and that's all you can do, you're saying that's unconstitutional? So you're really -- you are really hinging your argument on the discrimination aspect-- --that -- that drug companies or detailers are being treated differently than any other user of this information? Could you do it-- ",counsel that assume there be some form of privacy that relate to not be harass because there be certainly legislative record of doctor or group of doctor testify to feel harass by detailers if thompson require a less restrictive method why do this have to be an opt in rather than an opt out because be not an opt out i call up and say i do not want you to have this information so be not an opt out less restrictive well but give the restriction on speech why be that a bad thing meaning you do not really intend to tell us that the state could not and would not just like we get all of that advertising relate to the opt out on telephone solicitation virtually every american knew they could do it if they choose maybe some do not but a vast majority do you can not really say vermont s incapable of tell doctor in a mailing or in some public professional magazine if you want to opt out here s the number mr goldstein i i understand your argument and i have a difficulty today with the internet and with computer there be virtually no privacy individual have any transaction you do could be spread across the world instantaneously and for the long time catalog would sell your name and address to other cataloger and if you buy one product from one company you would get a thousand catalog from million others today the industry be police that in part to get the state not to intercede by give you an opt out option and so if you be a consumer who do not want a million catalog the industry be give you the right to opt out so they do not sell your address if there be as i see some interest that the state legitimately have in protect that part of the public who say i enter into this transaction i do not really want you to sell my name i do not want you to do other thing with it all i do be this transaction why can not the state say there be a difference in my mind between an opt in and opt out why can not the state say your desire to enter a transaction in which you be do just that transaction and not others be something we can protect i read in one of the brief that pharmacies we be not permit either patient andor doctor to opt out that if a patient come in and say i do not want my doctor s information sell or a doctor have call the pharmacy and say i do not want you to sell my information the pharmacy be not respect those limitation so why do not i read this statute as simply do what the consumer statute be do which be give people some control outside of the limited transaction that they be engage in so what you be say i think to justice kennedy be answer my early question by say the state can not constitutionally stop the spread of information so if the state say to the pharmacy all you can do be fill the prescription that be what doctor think pharmacy be do and that be all you can do you be say that be unconstitutional so you be really you be really hinge your argument on the discrimination aspect that that drug company or detailers be be treat differently than any other user of this information could you do it ,244.77,Roberts Court,"Apr 26, 2011","William H.

2010,"Williamson v. Mazda Motor of America, Inc.",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Well, it did say that earlier, didn't it? Earlier, it said that there was difficulties with -- pre-1989, '82 or '84, that there were difficulties with Type 2 belts and children's safety. So was this preempted in '82-'84 and not preempted by '89? So what do you need for the agency to say before Geier comes into effect? For the lower courts, what's the minimum that lower courts missed here in not -- in coming to the conclusion they did in their application of Geier? Can I ask you a question? How is this case different from a situation where the agency looks at a request for a minimum standard, says: Require that a certain light be added to the lights in a car. The agency comes back and says, you know, there are so many designs of cars; in some cars, particularly sedans, the light is an added safety feature; in vans it may not be because of the size of vans. And so we are not going to require it. We are going to let manufacturers, depending on what design their car has, to choose between the two, so that we're not going to set a minimum standard for every one because there are too many different designs. Despite that ruling, the manufacturer says it costs two pennies more to put this light in a sedan. I know the agency has said it's safer, but I don't want to do it. I don't have a van, I don't have any reason except the two pennies that I don't want to do it. Is that case preempted? Because you were just merely given the option? How is this different from the hypothetical where the agency said there could be an obstruction with the entry, but manufacturers who can design it without the obstruction should really do it. How is this, this case, different than the one hypothetical? But wait a minute. What that -- what you are not answering is flexibility to ensure that a manufacturer imposes or thinks about safety and chooses the option that is safest. So what's the inducement for a manufacturer to put the light into a sedan or to put a seatbelt 2, when it can, without causing an added safety risk? If it's preempted, there is no inducement. But that's always the case when the agency sets a minimum. By setting a minimum, it's basically saying we don't want to mandate more. But -- but you are not disagreeing that the statute by its term says that a minimum doesn't preempt State common law. So I'm still not sure why creating an option is any different than the minimum. But the default is always that the manufacturers have an option. A minimum by definition gives manufacturers options. But you haven't explained why. If the minimum by its own definition gives freedom to the manufacturer to impose more if it chooses, or not, why does the option to tell a manufacturer, pick what you think is safest, why does that do more? But I'm sorry, you still haven't responded to me. Manufacturers are always at risk for common law claims under this statute, because this statute expressly says they are. Every design choice a manufacturer makes under almost any situation where the common law is in effect puts it at risk that a jury will decide whether it did enough or not, under cost/benefit analysis and technology. So I don't know why when the agency creates a minimum by choice or not, it should be implicitly preempted in -- from the application of State law. But this wasn't the center seat. This was an aisle seat. But that is not the issue here. The issue is whether it was feasible in this car, not whether or not it was not feasible elsewhere. That goes to my point of the light in the sedan versus the van. It's letting the manufacturers decide what's the best choice. ",well it do say that early do not it earlier it say that there be difficulty with pre or that there we be difficulty with type belt and child s safety so be this preempt in and not preempt by so what do you need for the agency to say before geier come into effect for the low court what be the minimum that low court miss here in not in come to the conclusion they do in their application of geier can i ask you a question how be this case different from a situation where the agency look at a request for a minimum standard say require that a certain light be add to the light in a car the agency come back and say you know there be so many design of car in some car particularly sedan the light be an added safety feature in van it may not be because of the size of van and so we be not go to require it we be go to let manufacturer depend on what design their car have to choose between the two so that we be not go to set a minimum standard for every one because there be too many different design despite that ruling the manufacturer say it cost two penny more to put this light in a sedan i know the agency have say it be safer but i do not want to do it i do not have a van i do not have any reason except the two penny that i do not want to do it be that case preempt because you we be just merely give the option how be this different from the hypothetical where the agency say there could be an obstruction with the entry but manufacturer who can design it without the obstruction should really do it how be this this case different than the one hypothetical but wait a minute what that what you be not answer be flexibility to ensure that a manufacturer impose or think about safety and choose the option that be safest so what be the inducement for a manufacturer to put the light into a sedan or to put a seatbelt when it can without cause an added safety risk if it be preempt there be no inducement but that be always the case when the agency set a minimum by set a minimum it be basically say we do not want to mandate more but but you be not disagree that the statute by its term say that a minimum do not preempt state common law so I be still not sure why create an option be any different than the minimum but the default be always that the manufacturer have an option a minimum by definition give manufacturer option but you have not explain why if the minimum by its own definition give freedom to the manufacturer to impose more if it choose or not why do the option to tell a manufacturer pick what you think be safe why do that do more but I be sorry you still have not respond to me manufacturer be always at risk for common law claim under this statute because this statute expressly say they be every design choice a manufacturer make under almost any situation where the common law be in effect put it at risk that a jury will decide whether it do enough or not under costbenefit analysis and technology so i do not know why when the agency create a minimum by choice or not it should be implicitly preempt in from the application of state law but this be not the center seat this be an aisle seat but that be not the issue here the issue be whether it be feasible in this car not whether or not it be not feasible elsewhere that go to my point of the light in the sedan versus the van it be let the manufacturer decide what be the best choice ,279.68000000000006,Roberts Court,"Nov 3, 2010","Delbert Williamson, et al.","Mazda Motor of America, Inc., et al.",08-1314,"May 24, 2010","Feb 23, 2011",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2010,"Ransom v. FIA Card Services, N.A.",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Do they apply -- do the Courts apply the housing and utilities listed amount whether or not you pay for a house or not, whether or not you rent? --food costs, housing costs, utility costs, by getting his parents to pay for those things and still take this deduction? Your adversary said that only two courts have addressed this issue and have permitted those deductions. So under what reasoning would we apply a different standard to the car costs as opposed to those other costs? Housing. Where does it say that? The debtor's monthly expenses shall be the debtor's applicable monthly expense amount specified under the national and local standards. So the national and local standards have amounts listed. Where does it say you take only the actual, not the national or local standards? But that's -- but that's not what the provision at issue here says. It says you use the amount specified under the national standards and you use actual for everything else. That's what the statute says. So now you are trying to move the actual into the first half of the test? Why would you even bother? Why don't you -- if -- if what you are arguing is that only actual expenses are -- are what you can claim, you wouldn't need the first half. So what you would have the statute read is: The debtor's monthly expenses shall be the debtor's applicable monthly expense amount specified, as a -- as a maximum. You would have to add ""maximum"" somewhere there. So what you are proposing is that every debtor has to go to the Bankruptcy Court and show what their monthly food bills have been over what period of time, how much their personal supplies have been over what period of time? How can you calculate forward what they are going to spend on a monthly basis for each of those items? Isn't that the reason the tables are used, so that you don't have to do that? So then you would be comfortable with a person who owns a house outright who only pays $100 in utilities taking the full amount of the housing and utilities allowable living expenses because that's the amount specified?

2010,Fox v. Vice,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, can I understand what legal analysis you're proposing? Your blue brief seems to suggest, as does your argument a few minutes ago, that you want the Sixth Circuit's rule, which is the only circuit that applies this rule, that says when the facts are identical and intertwined, the defendant gets no fees. All of the other circuits, as far as I can tell, don't go to that extreme. They say something closer to what you started with, and your yellow brief suggests, is a but-for cause: The defendant is entitled to those costs related to the defense of the frivolous claim. Which of the two theories are you advocating? And then a separate question, of what standard of review should be imposed in those situations in which the activities are so intertwined, but there is still a core essence of defense of the Federal claim, which is some of the hypotheticals my colleagues-- --assume. But there are difference -- are differences in how we read those other circuits, but I'll accept your proposition. Counsel, did the -- the district court here said they're intertwined claims, they all relate to the frivolous claim, they're entitled to full fees. The Fifth Circuit seemed to do the but-for test. Are you agreeing with that? It's -- the language it uses sounds like a but-for test: ""A defendant is only entitled to attorney's fees for work which can be distinctly traced to frivolous claims. "" ""We are confident that the district court can assess the amount of attorney's fees attributable exclusively to a plaintiff's frivolous claims. "" Is that correct? You think they misapplied that? Two. And they joined the Ninth and the -- and the other circuits that have the but-for. So it's three places. They said we're not joining an exclusive fees entitlement either way, we're joining what the majority of the circuits are doing. So why can't you prove that? Why can't you prove that in a but-for situation? Why don't you tell me what you -- your proposed standard is. As I understand it, you would say if the Federal claim is frivolous, then you're entitled to all fees, even if the State law claims overlap and have merit or potential merit. I think -- is that your position? Eligibility, it has to be a frivolous claim, that's-- --But I thought what Congress said and what we've said in Hensley, that the only thing that the defendant is entitled to fees for is the burden of the frivolous Federal claim. Your -- your answer to Justice Kagan is suggesting that even if the plaintiff wins, wins everything they were seeking, you're still entitled to 80 percent of your fees, even though the Federal claim didn't add anything to your work -- to your work, except 20 percent? But tell me why we would, given the differences that we've announced in Hensley between prevailing plaintiffs and prevailing defendants -- because you can only prevail as to a frivolous fee. Why do we start with your entitlement to your entire fee and deduct from it, instead of starting the other way, which seems more logical, which is you're entitled to the fees related to your frivolous claim, so why don't you have to prove that first? No. No, no, no. We're assuming a lawsuit that has -- as this one, that has both Federal and State claims and only one -- whether it's one frivolous Federal claim or multiple Federal claims and two are frivolous, one is not, and there is a bunch of State court claims. So why do we start with your total fee and deduct down, rather than start where all the circuits are starting, which is to say, what can be attributed to that frivolous claim, which is the only thing you're entitled to fees from? Counsel, every other circuit except for the Sixth has dealt with the but-for test or some variant of it. Even the Fifth did it in this case and ruled in your favor. What you're asking for is, I think, very akin to the opposite rule of saying if we dismiss the Federal litigation, you're not entitled to any fees, because this case was about -- is in Federal Court, so that's the only thing that matters. That seems to be your rule. Every other circuit has some variant of but-for, and they seem to manage it just fine. Nobody likes attorney's fees. Espouse your test for me, because I still don't understand it except for flipping through Hensley, but Hensley has a different predicate, which is that plaintiffs are -- if they win, they're entitled to fees. I'm not sure what that means, because if you're taking discovery on the State law issues, defamation, extortion, et cetera, you're pressing it. At the point that the Federal action is dismissed you no longer can pursue that in Federal court to its conclusion. Then why would -- if you have a bunch of different claims and the facts support some of the State court actions, why should you be entitled to fees that you would have incurred in State court no matter what? Did you -- are you seriously contending that the lawyer below didn't understand that the defamation and the extortion claims were part of this case? I'm hard pressed to believe that reading that complaint would not doubt that-- --Found? In answer to Justice Scalia's question, basically the only difference you have with the -- with the Fifth Circuit is that you would say fees fairly attributable to Federal claims as opposed to fees exclusively attributable to Federal claims; is that correct? So your presumption would be that if the fees are -- support both State and Federal claims, you're still entitled to fees? I still -- I don't understand what that means. You want district courts to determine how important the 1983 claim was in relationship to the State claim? ",counsel can i understand what legal analysis you be propose your blue brief seem to suggest as do your argument a few minute ago that you want the sixth circuit s rule which be the only circuit that apply this rule that say when the fact be identical and intertwine the defendant get no fee all of the other circuit as far as i can tell do not go to that extreme they say something close to what you

2010,Bruesewitz v. Wyeth Inc.,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"You keep saying that. But didn't I understand correctly that that drug was withdrawn from the Japanese market in which it had originally been-- --Was it proven that it was as effective? Explain why. Is there any provision in the regulations that require a manufacturer to withdraw a drug earlier than when the FDA tells them to? So this immunity would come along until they go to the FDA and say, Well, we've gotten enough incidents to prove-- So why didn't they make the vaccine court exclusive? There is plenty of administrative systems that make -- preclude State law actions altogether and place you in administrative proceedings. So if their intent was to drive out State lawsuits, why not do that? So, how -- couldn't they have taken care of that with Daubert? I mean, won't most of these cases get resolved on a motion for summary judgment? Point me to the FDA regulations or law where the FDA, in giving a license to or permitting a new vaccine, actually looks at whether that vaccine is the most efficacious way with the least serious harm to the population. Is there a regulation that requires that judgment by them before they issue permission to market? All right. What is the motivation? If there is no -- there's no approval mechanism for the FDA to look at that issue, what is the motivation for manufacturers to voluntarily remove a drug that is causing harm to the public before the FDA acts? If they are completely immune under your reading of this preemption statute, what motivates them to act more quickly? Could you please just answer that question? What is the motivation for the manufacturer to either continue the testing of their product and voluntarily stopping it if a better design has been found by someone else or even an inducement for them to find a better design if a competitor comes around? Because I don't see why they should stop until they have caused as many injuries as they need to before the FDA says stop. What is the inducement for them to do it voluntarily? I am not asking about the FDA. I said the manufacturers' motivations. Does the victim of that withholding have a private cause of action? I don't see anything in this that would give them-- --Or there is something better on the market than this that won't cause that. What do those 64 percent do now? What is the percentage of those people who actually go into court now? Is that because whatever the percentage is, proving causation is never easy-- --for non-listed-- --You are making an assumption that has a flawed premise, which is that their only concern was protecting the manufacturers. It couldn't have been. Not only do they compensate victims, but they permitted victims to go into State court. No, no, no. That's your assumption. My point is that if we are talking about what the purpose was, you can't assume that-- --So what you are suggesting is there is no compensation for an injury that was avoidable in its normal sense, which is-- --If this drug had not been sold and another drug had been used the person would have avoided their injury. It sounds to me that you're going to win on non-summary judgment. I don't see -- I do understand the cost of litigation. It can be very, very onerous. So I'm not trying to minimize it, but I do think that there's a whole lot of hurdles in place before a plaintiff wins on one of these claims. Excuse me -- going back to the point you just started with-- --which was is this -- is the Control -- Disease Center, is it making a judgment before it approves a drug for licensing, that it's the most efficacious drug on market? No-- --Where do I look at that? At what documents do I look at to make a judgment that in fact, CDC is doing what I ask, that it is looking at the question of whether this is the most efficacious drug with the least adverse effects? Is that a judgment it's making? We know the FDA is not. Are you representing to us right now that CDC makes that judgment? That would include comparisons to other drugs on the market? ",you keep say that but do not i understand correctly that that drug be withdraw from the japanese market in which it have originally be be it prove that it be as effective explain why be there any provision in the regulation that require a manufacturer to withdraw a drug earlier than when the fda tell them to so this immunity would come along until they go to the fda and say well we have get enough incident to prove so why do not they make the vaccine court exclusive there be plenty of administrative system that make preclude state law action altogether and place you in administrative proceeding so if their intent be to drive out state lawsuit why not do that so how could not they have take care of that with daubert i mean will not most of these case get resolve on a motion for summary judgment point me to the fda regulation or law where the fda in give a license to or permit a new vaccine actually look at whether that vaccine be the most efficacious way with the least serious harm to the population be there a regulation that require that judgment by them before they issue permission to market all right what be the motivation if there be no there be no approval mechanism for the fda to look at that issue what be the motivation for manufacturer to voluntarily remove a drug that be cause harm to the public before the fda act if they be completely immune under your reading of this preemption statute what motivate them to act more quickly could you please just answer that question what be the motivation for the manufacturer to either continue the testing of their product and voluntarily stop it if a good design have be find by someone else or even an inducement for them to find a good design if a competitor come around because i do not see why they should stop until they have cause as many injury as they need to before the fda say stop what be the inducement for them to do it voluntarily i be not ask about the fda i say the manufacturer motivation do the victim of that withhold have a private because of action i do not see anything in this that would give them or there be something well on the market than this that will not because that what do those percent do now what be the percentage of those people who actually go into court now be that because whatever the percentage be prove causation be never easy for non list you be make an assumption that have a flaw premise which be that their only concern be protect the manufacturer it could not have be not only do they compensate victim but they permit victim to go into state court no no no that be your assumption my point be that if we be talk about what the purpose be you can not assume that so what you be suggest be there be no compensation for an injury that be avoidable in its normal sense which be if this drug have not be sell and another drug have be use the person would have avoid their injury it sound to me that you be go to win on non summary judgment i do not see i do understand the cost of litigation it can be very very onerous so I be not try to minimize it but i do think that there be a whole lot of hurdle in place before a plaintiff win on one of these claim excuse me go back to the point you just start with which be be this be the control disease center be it make a judgment before it approve a drug for licensing that it be the most efficacious drug on market no where do i look at that at what document do i look at to make a judgment that in fact cdc be do what i ask that it be look at the question of whether this be the most efficacious drug with the least adverse effect be that a judgment it be make we know the fda be not be you represent to us right now that cdc make that judgment that would include comparison to other drug on the market ,276.16,Roberts Court,"Oct 12, 2010","Russell Bruesewitz, et al.","Wyeth, Inc., fka Wyeth Laboratories, et al.",09-152,"Mar 8, 2010","Feb 22, 2011",113.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2010,Michigan v. Bryant,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"But whose primary purpose is it? I mean, the victim here knew that the incident hadn't happened there. There was nothing he had to share with the police, because they could see he was bleeding from his stomach and he had been shot. He apparently didn't fear any threat, or there doesn't seem to be any circumstances suggesting an immediate threat to him. He had driven away. Rick didn't know where he had gone. So what's the ongoing emergency to the victim? Well, wait a minute. What is the primary -- isn't -- doesn't -- isn't there a footnote that says the primary purpose of the declarant is what is at issue? Well, in Davis, the issue is: Why was the declarant talking? What you were trying to do was to figure out whether the declarant was seeking help or attempting to get someone arrested. That's how I read the situation. The questions provided context for that. Are you seeking immediate ongoing help or are you talking about an event, attempting to get the police to intercede and arrest the person? Isn't that a fair reading of that case? But what does that have to do -- we are back to the reliability test, really, because they didn't do anything wrong. They were trying to assess the situation. But that's just what they do when any report of criminal activity occurs. That's a different inquiry than the inquiry of: Why should that statement be permitted to be introduced at trial? It goes to the very essence of reliability. Was the statement made under circumstances that would suggest an intent to testify? That's really what you're getting at, isn't it? Well, you are, because you were trying to pigeonhole yourself into an ongoing emergency that suggests that in those situations, whatever the person is saying is okay, because it was done to assess an emergency situation and not done for purposes of catching somebody, primary purpose of catching somebody. For all crimes, or only for shooting crimes or knifing crimes? For explosions? What kinds of crimes would qualify? You don't think there is a danger implicated by coming onto the lawn of a school and a student is there and says the principal shot me inside. You don't think that that suggests an ongoing emergency? That the principal is still inside with a gun? Did he shoot you because he had a grudge against you or did he just shoot you blindly and he says he shot me? Let's go to formality. It can't be that you arrive at a scene of a crime and everything a victim tells you is admissible. There has to be some emergency. That's what we have said. Correct? So the issue here is how do you define that dividing line between emergency and non when the police officers are just asking questions that by their nature are always going to be testimonial, because they are going to use or try to use whatever is said later. So in discerning the primary purpose, I think your adversary is saying, you can't go by what the police officer are asking, because they are going to be asking dual motive always. You have to look to what the Declarant tells you. And is he or she telling you something that suggests an emergency? That's really the difference between the two of you, I think. ",but whose primary purpose be it i mean the victim here know that the incident have not happen there there be nothing he have to share with the police because they could see he be bleed from his stomach and he have be shoot he apparently do not fear any threat or there do not seem to be any circumstance suggest an immediate threat to him he have drive away rick do not know where he have go so what be the ongoing emergency to the victim well wait a minute what be the primary be not do not be not there a footnote that say the primary purpose of the declarant be what be at issue well in davis the issue be why be the declarant talk what you we be try to do be to figure out whether the declarant be seek help or attempt to get someone arrest that be how i read the situation the question provide context for that be you seek immediate ongoing help or be you talk about an event attempt to get the police to intercede and arrest the person be not that a fair reading of that case but what do that have to do we be back to the reliability test really because they do not do anything wrong they we be try to assess the situation but that be just what they do when any report of criminal activity occur that be a different inquiry than the inquiry of why should that statement be permit to be introduce at trial it go to the very essence of reliability be the statement make under circumstance that would suggest an intent to testify that be really what you be get at be not it well you be because you we be try to pigeonhole yourself into an ongoing emergency that suggest that in those situation whatever the person be say be okay because it be do to assess an emergency situation and not do for purpose of catch somebody primary purpose of catch somebody for all crime or only for shoot crime or knife crime for explosion what kinds of crime would qualify you do not think there be a danger implicate by come onto the lawn of a school and a student be there and say the principal shot me inside you do not think that that suggest an ongoing emergency that the principal be still inside with a gun do he shoot you because he have a grudge against you or do he just shoot you blindly and he say he shoot me let us go to formality it can not be that you arrive at a scene of a crime and everything a victim tell you be admissible there have to be some emergency that be what we have say correct so the issue here be how do you define that divide line between emergency and non when the police officer be just ask question that by their nature be always go to be testimonial because they be go to use or try to use whatever be say later so in discern the primary purpose i think your adversary be say you can not go by what the police officer be ask because they be go to be ask dual motive always you have to look to what the declarant tell you and be he or she tell you something that suggest an emergency that be really the difference between the two of you i think ,210.89,Roberts Court,"Oct 5, 2010",Michigan,Richard Perry Bryant,09-150,"Mar 1, 2010","Feb 28, 2011",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2010,Kentucky v. King,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"--to the Chief Justice when he said -- and I think this was the Solicitor General's position -- that the police can routinely knock at a door and wait to see if they hear a toilet flushing. I -- I've taken it out of this case but -- because I don't know what noise means. But your answer would be yes? Well, why -- why do you need the probable cause inquiry? What does it have to do with anything? Before they can go in-- --because they have just heard the toilet flushing? And in your view-- --Counsel, why was -- how does this holding by us not become a simple warrantless entry in any drug case, meaning police knock on the door, suspect doesn't answer it, gets up and moves to their bedroom? Because there's no noise that was described by this police officer. It was simply not answering the door and moving. So if that's all it takes, any police officer will come in and say: In my experience, most drug dealers destroy the evidence when we knock. Aren't we just doing away with Johnson? And aren't we just simply saying they can just walk in whenever they smell marijuana, whenever they think there's drugs on the other side? Why do we even bother giving them a -- a warrant? What if the officers had simply knocked, said we're going to kick the door in if you don't open it? Could you -- does a ruling in this case that any lawful conduct by the police mean that the police knock, somebody gets up on the other side and walks through a closed door, and closes a door in the back, and police say in my experience it's -- it's consistent with the destruction of property that drug dealers will go into a closed room to get rid of it. Is that enough? But what makes that different than knocking on the door and saying, open the door or I'm going to kick it in? You're saying that's lawful because until the person submits, you're suggesting there's no coercion in that whatsoever. So why wouldn't that objectively be bad faith if what we find out is they now have a tactic which is they go through this building and every time they smell marijuana, hash, or -- I don't know if crack cocaine smells or not when they're smoking it, but whenever they smell something, they just do that. So there's no bad faith measure whatsoever in your-- --analysis, and lawfulness is defined by actual physical seizure. So if we have cases that suggest something else, a command to submit, your argument would be lost, correct? Did the trial court make those findings? I know that you said it in your brief, and I thought I read the trial court record. I know they knocked loudly. But what else did they do? But what does that have to do with the -- the police officers' lawfulness? Now, I -- I grant you that attempting -- that there is something troubling about the police attempting to coerce entry as opposed to requesting entry; but as my colleagues have pointed out, it's not clear from this record which of the two the police did, in a loud voice or not. You're saying just a loud knock, a scream, ""Police"", that that would be coercive? That's how I'm reading you. Or -- or are you going further and trying to say that as a matter of fact the testimony's critically clear that they knocked loudly, said ""Police"", and said let us in or we're going to bust it? ",to the chief justice when he say and i think this be the solicitor general s position that the police can routinely knock at a door and wait to see if they hear a toilet flushing i I have take it out of this case but because i do not know what noise mean but your answer would be yes well why why do you need the probable because inquiry what do it have to do with anything before they can go in because they have just hear the toilet flushing and in your view counsel why be how do this hold by us not become a simple warrantless entry in any drug case mean police knock on the door suspect do not answer it get up and move to their bedroom because there be no noise that be describe by this police officer it be simply not answer the door and moving so if that be all it take any police officer will come in and say in my experience most drug dealer destroy the evidence when we knock be not we just do away with johnson and be not we just simply say they can just walk in whenever they smell marijuana whenever they think there have drug on the other side why do we even bother give them a a warrant what if the officer have simply knock say we be go to kick the door in if you do not open it could you do a ruling in this case that any lawful conduct by the police mean that the police knock somebody get up on the other side and walk through a closed door and close a door in the back and police say in my experience it be it be consistent with the destruction of property that drug dealer will go into a closed room to get rid of it be that enough but what make that different than knock on the door and say open the door or I be go to kick it in you be say that be lawful because until the person submits you be suggest there be no coercion in that whatsoever so why would not that objectively be bad faith if what we find out be they now have a tactic which be they go through this building and every time they smell marijuana hash or i do not know if crack cocaine smell or not when they be smoke it but whenever they smell something they just do that so there be no bad faith measure whatsoever in your analysis and lawfulness be define by actual physical seizure so if we have case that suggest something else a command to submit your argument would be lose correct do the trial court make those finding i know that you say it in your brief and i think i read the trial court record i know they knock loudly but what else do they do but what do that have to do with the the police officer lawfulness now i i grant you that attempt that there be something trouble about the police attempt to coerce entry as oppose to request entry but as my colleague have point out it be not clear from this record which of the two the police do in a loud voice or not you be say just a loud knock a scream police that that would be coercive that be how I be read you or or be you go further and try to say that as a matter of fact the testimony s critically clear that they knock loudly say police and say let us in or we be go to bust it ,241.54,Roberts Court,"Jan 12, 2011",Kentucky,Hollis Deshaun King,09-1272,"Sep 28, 2010","May 16, 2011",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2010,Snyder v. Phelps,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Excuse me-- --Were they encouraged-- --Counsel, I'm trying to tease out the importance of the -- whether the person's a private -- or public figure -- a private person or a public figure. Does it make a difference if I am directing public comments to a public or private figure? No, I'm talking about in terms of infliction of emotional distress. If I am talking to you as a Marine, if you were a Marine, and I was talking about the Iran war and saying that you are perpetuating the horrors that America's doing and said other things that were offensive, would you have a cause of action because you are being called a perpetrator of the American experience? But you are saying yes. So public speech, speech on a public matter, if directed to a private person, should be treated differently under the law? I think that was part of what Justice Breyer was asking. Is that what your position is? All right. And under what theory of the First Amendment would we do that? What case would stand for, our case, stand for the proposition that public speech or speech on a public matter should be treated differently depending on the recipient of the speech? That was defamation. That's false -- truth or falsity. But have they done it in the context of differentiating between public and private speech? I was not talking about State cases. I was talking about a Supreme Court case that suggested that we would treat -- we would treat the First Amendment and the right to -- to speak on public matters differently, depending on the person to whom it was directed? So it goes -- it goes to the context. Now, going to the context of this speech, do we look at the words on a sign alone or do we look at the entire context of what all of the other signs said at the demonstration, to determine whether or not the speech here was public or private speech? Well, in that case-- Counsel, I am following your argument that the bulk of your speech in the epic, and even the bulk of your signs, involve public speech. What you have not explained to me is how your speech directed at the Snyders constituted public speech, or speech about a public matter. Because you are talking about them raising Matthew for the devil, teaching him to, I think, defy the creator, to divorce and commit adultery. At what point and how do we take personal attacks and permit those, as opposed to -- I fully accept you're entitled in some circumstances to speak about any political issue you want. But what's the line between doing that and then personalizing it and creating hardship to an individual? So if we disagree that that made him a public figure, if we view him as a private figure, is that enough to defeat your argument? Assume that the Matthews are private figures and you did this. So explain to me how you are protected by the First Amendment. You want to change my assumption. We assume that he is a private figure. You have now made a public statement and directed personal comments at an individual who is a private figure. Is that actionable?

2010,Smith v. Bayer Corp.,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"On the ground that the court here, the Federal court, decided that they weren't predominant issues based mostly on the fact that, like the Virginia court has now, it's decided that there is no economic loss, what were the differences? What were the differences here? How would the difference in standard play out here? The -- I'm sorry. I don't mean to cut you off, but you're really arguing that due process requires the same treatment, essentially, of notice and an opportunity to be heard that we are giving to a substantive decision that blocks a future member from pursuing his or her claim, correct? You're almost treating it as a property right, and -- and you're basically saying we're equating it with, essentially, a property right. If we disagree with you, because there is a difference of some sort between procedure and substantive rights, then what would command the due process violation in a situation in which the Federal litigation has applied essentially the same standard that the State has and there has been adequate representation on the procedural question, where no substantive right of a plaintiff has been extinguished? That's a lot of conditions, but those are the three conditions of this case. So what in due process requires that outcome, your outcome? You're extinguishing a substantive right? Return to my question of what makes a procedural right substantive. Actually not true. The plaintiff here received the same thing. The issue is how much money the lawyers are going to receive, really, because plaintiff gets their attorney's fees, gets a statutory violation amount, which is going to be the same whether it's in a class action or an individual action, so it's really not the plaintiff who stands to win. Counsel, under the Anti-Injunction Act, would it permit a blanket injunction that says, against all future State court class proceedings across the United States? Could a court just order a re-litigation bar? That's my question to you. So articulate what we're comparing when we're saying that the relitigation bar can apply to a procedural ruling. We started a little bit on the question. Is there any requirement that that issue have been fully and fairly adjudicated in the prior proceedings? Let's say -- you talked about different standards. Your adversary said that in this State reliance doesn't need to be proven. Let's assume that fact. And the district court's ruling here was based on a reliance requirement and said no predominance because each individual plaintiff will have to prove reliance. Does that become the same -- a different standard or no? I -- I -- I'm posing it as a hypothetical. As a hypothetical. You see, the problem is that I don't know how you get and when you get to the question of whether reliance needs to be proven or not, if you're going to bar the State court from reaching that -- that substantive question, not that substantive issue, but that substantive question, which is not very different from here, which is what does economic loss require in terms of proof? Well, I'm shifting them only to try to get-- --a sense of what different standards mean-- --to you, and how we articulate that rule in a way that doesn't preclude -- doesn't permit the barring-- --of claims when there is a different standard.

2010,Bond v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Let's assume in this hypothetical -- just that case, TVA. State -- the Federal Government sets the price, and someone's accused of violating that price. Can that defendant come in and say, just as in TVA, that's unconstitutional because prices have to be set by the State? Can the defendant say that, or is that an anticommandeering claim that you say they're barred from raising? So my question goes back to one that's been asked before, which is, give me a hypothetical of a defendant who has been convicted where it would be a pure anticommandeering claim that you say they have no standing for. Does that analysis differ in any way because this is a treaty power claim versus a Commerce Clause claim? Your briefs go back and forth on which one it is. Your reply brief now emphasizes Commerce Clause power, but your main brief was saying this is a treaty provision challenge. Do they differ? Excuse me. What do you see specifically? Because there's a lot of discussion about labels and what the labels mean in this case. But tell me specifically what -- not the word she uses, but the specific ways in which prudential considerations bar her standing; meaning: What about the nature of her claim prudentially should counsel us against giving her standing? Do you think Pennsylvania would be upset that the Federal Government got her when they couldn't? Could you just articulate for me -- we're speaking in generalities -- what in the nature of her claim, taking the labels away, do you think is a pure Tenth Amendment challenge? As I read her complaint, and it's always that it's a Tenth Amendment claim because Congress and the president have exceeded their powers in some-- --That's -- you haven't answered my -- my question. Why isn't that a merits decision as to whether or not the President and Congress have the power to enact this legislation? Isn't that an issue for a civil lawsuit as opposed to a criminal one? Because all that would happen in a criminal suit is that the defendant's conviction would be undone, but that doesn't mean that the State is bound in some way. The State wasn't a party to the criminal action. Well, there's two things that could happen. One is that if the State loses, then -- and it doesn't want to lose -- it passes its own law. Or if it wins, if the case is as stated below, it just lets the status quo go. I still don't understand what the long-term injury to the State is or could be.

2010,McNeill v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, I -- I have just one problem, which is under your theory, I understand it, if a State increases a penalty, makes what would have been a penalty for a misdemeanor now a felony, then that defendant is a career criminal, by your logic. So the person who thought that at the time they committed the crime they were committing a low-level crime is now a felon; is that your theory of the case? What -- what -- what logic do you think there is in that, why Congress would want to punish someone now for -- for criminal activity that they thought was lesser, and the State thought was lesser, at an earlier time, less reprehensible? I'm sorry, how do you see that? I thought the government had two alternative positions, the first being that you look at the time -- at the time of the offense, at the conviction or, alternatively, it was arguing the way to take the position of the court below. But if you're going to use the present tense then you look retroactively to see -- then you look to see whether the State would retroactively apply the new sentence. You understood their brief differently? I'm sure they'll tell you. [Laughter] Could I -- just to clarify your point. If there's been a modification of law that would have entitled him to a retroactive change in his sentence, although I'm not quite sure how that works, because if there's a modification, I thought it would only apply to a defendant who had committed the crime at that earlier time but was convicted at the present time. This defendant wouldn't have his sentence modified. Well, that's my question. Is your footnote related to that kind of individual only or are you saying -- or are you accepting your adversary's argument that the circuit below got it right? You look at the is as to what the sentence would be today-- --if this person had committed the crime? I'm just trying to clarify whether you mean that the -- the modification had to have occurred, meaning that he was convicted, he got 10 years, and somewhere for some State reason, that actual final judgment was amended to include 5. Are or are you talking about-- --accepting his argument that if he could apply for a change now-- --Is this the first time you're advancing the argument, the first part of your argument?

There's some claims to the contrary in your briefs before us, but I've looked for that below, and there doesn't appear to be any record of that. So, I'm going to start from that -- that assumption, that there was no evidence in the courts below that any candidate stopped speaking because of or stopped collecting money because of this. So exactly what is the burden otherwise? What are you claiming the burden is? The burden is that the -- that the government is choosing to give someone else money?

2010,Camreta v. Greene,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"General-- --I'm sorry. Isn't that -- isn't that the -- the county's claim? How Camreta does his job doesn't -- that claim doesn't belong to him; it belongs to the entity who is telling him how to do his job. And so why don't we go back to Justice Ginsburg's question of why isn't the Monell situation the proper case? Because there, it's the party interested in how its officers will do their job at its directive. It has the case and controversy at issue, not S.G.-- Right now, she's never going to be investigated again. She's in another State. I understand that she doesn't even ever want to return to Oregon for, probably, fairly good reasons, at least from her perspective. So, again, why isn't this the interests of the county, not -- not the interests of the officer? Counsel, if we were to hold this case was moot, what would -- what do you think the appropriate disposition of the case would be? Well, you don't really want that, because the Ninth Circuit granted qualified immunity. What would be -- what would we be vacating? They haven't rendered a judgment on the search warrant issue. Vacate the opinion. Excuse me-- If we told them-- --Counsel, would -- I'm interrupting you only for a quick reason. What's the test? Is it a question of whether the seizure is reasonable or not? All right. So -- so that would be your proposed test. If we were to say you don't need any of those three things right now, where would that leave us or leave the courts below on determining whether what happened here was reasonable or not? Meaning, what if a child is called in and says, I don't want to talk to you without my mom; and they continue to speak to the child? Is that reasonable? So how do we-- --How do we develop the law, or how do we help develop the law in this case if we answer your question but leave unanswered with no parameters, any idea -- because we have no set of facts; no one's going to review that question -- of what is reasonable in this context? That -- you see, that's the problem with taking up a case with no case in controversy, because what do we do? We don't remand for them to reach the second question, which is really the one that law enforcement needs some help on. Counsel, are you -- I just want to make sure I understand your position. Answering Justice Scalia's question: Child walks into the room -- is taken out of their classroom, walks into the room. The officer says: We've heard that your mommy and daddy are doing some things to your private parts; is that true? And the child says -- 9-year-old child says: I wish somebody had asked me before. I'm so afraid of my daddy. He does these horrible things to me. Are you seriously suggesting that if the police stay there for an hour debriefing that child as to the circumstances of that situation, that that's a seizure? It seems to me that what you-- --Well, but what does that have to do or change the police bringing a child into a room and just asking the question? When does -- that's what you seem to have said to Justice Scalia, which is that the mere removal from the classroom is the -- the defining feature of seizure. So it can't be that. They don't know if there's exigent circumstances until they ask the question. Doesn't that go to the question of the reasonableness of the scope of the seizure? Don't we have Lidster and -- and other jurisprudence that basically addresses this question and says is this type of seizure or stop detention reasonable? And it's hard to swallow that if a police officer asks a child are you being abused and the child says, yes, I need help, it is nearly impossible to think that that seizure is unreasonable. You're -- you're -- you're -- it may well be that 2 hours for a protesting child would be, but isn't that all subject to a question of reasonableness as to the scope of the seizure? General, just a point of clarification before you go on. You said earlier that your office had advised the county not to seize children. Does that mean they're not talking to children at all? Is -- you used the word seized. Are you advising them that they don't have the right to talk to children? Without their parental consent or a warrant? What's the standard? I mean, I just assume you're not suggesting that this procedure could be used with every child in every school without some ground for suspicion, correct? Would you -- are you -- and I guess what I'm asking is, let's assume we go ex ante. At any moment that an agency speaks to a child, they can move from a nonseizure to a seizure, correct? And some seizures can be reasonable and some can't, right? And law enforcement is never going to know where that line of reasonableness or unreasonableness is, is that correct? That's in -- that's in the nature of doing this without a warrant, isn't it? But they do it anyway, meaning even if we say that they can seize the child, you would still have to not do a seizure that was unreasonable. You wouldn't -- in scope. They can't speak to the child endlessly, can they? I'm not quite sure why you stipulated to a seizure in this case, but that was your strategic choice. ",general I be sorry be not that be not that the the county s claim how camreta do his job do not that claim do not belong to him it belong to the entity who be tell him how to do his job and so why do not we go back to justice ginsburg s question of why be not the monell situation the proper case because there it be the party interested in how its officer will do their job at its directive it have the case and controversy at issue not sg right now she be never go to be investigate again she be in another state i understand that she do not even ever want to return to oregon for probably fairly good reason at least from her perspective so again why be not this the interest of the county not not the interest of the officer counsel if we we be to hold this case be moot what would what do you think the appropriate disposition of the case would be well you do not really want that because the ninth circuit grant qualified immunity what would be what would we be vacate they have not render a judgment on the search warrant issue vacate the opinion excuse me if we tell them counsel would I be interrupt you only for a quick reason what be the test be it a question of whether the seizure be reasonable or not all right so so that would be your propose test if we we be to say you do not need any of those three thing right now where would that leave us or leave the court below on determine whether what happen here be reasonable or not meaning what if a child be call in and say i do not want to talk to you without my mom and they continue to speak to the child be that reasonable so how do we how do we develop the law or how do we help develop the law in this case if we answer your question but leave unanswered with no parameter any idea because we have no set of fact no one s go to review that question of what be reasonable in this context that you see that be the problem with take up a case with no case in controversy because what do we do we do not remand for them to reach the second question which be really the one that law enforcement need some help on counsel be you i just want to make sure i understand your position answer justice scalia s question child walk into the room be take out of their classroom walks into the room the officer say we have hear that your mommy and daddy be do some thing to your private part be that true and the child say year old child say i wish somebody have ask me before I be so afraid of my daddy he do these horrible thing to me be you seriously suggest that if the police stay there for an hour debriefing that child as to the circumstance of that situation that that be a seizure it seem to me that what you well but what do that have to do or change the police bring a child into a room and just ask the question when do that be what you seem to have say to justice scalia which be that the mere removal from the classroom be the the defining feature of seizure so it can not be that they do not know if there be exigent circumstance until they ask the question do not that go to the question of the reasonableness of the scope of the seizure do not we have lidster and and other jurisprudence that basically address this question and say be this type of seizure or stop detention reasonable and it be hard to swallow that if a police officer ask a child be you be abuse and the child say yes i need help it be nearly impossible to think that that seizure be unreasonable you be you be you be it may well be that hour for a protesting child would be but be not that all subject to a question of reasonableness as to the scope of the seizure general just a point of clarification before you go on you say early that your office have advise the county not to seize child do that mean they be not talk to child at all be you use the word seize be you advise them that they do not have the right to talk to child without their parental consent or a warrant what be the standard i mean i just assume you be not suggest that this procedure could be use with every child in every school without some ground for suspicion correct would you be you and i guess what I be ask be let us assume we go ex ante at any moment that an agency speak to a child they can move from a nonseizure to a seizure correct and some seizure can be reasonable and some can not right and law enforcement be never go to know where that line of reasonableness or unreasonableness be be that correct that be in that be in the nature of do this without a warrant be not it but they do it anyway mean even if we say that they can seize the child you would still have to not do a seizure that be unreasonable you would not in scope they can not speak to the child endlessly can they I be not quite sure why you stipulate to a seizure in this case but that be your strategic choice ,354.04,Roberts Court,"Mar 1, 2011",Bob Camreta,"Sarah Greene, et al.",09-1454,"Oct 12, 2010","May 26, 2011",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2010,United States  v. Tinklenberg,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, on that issue, do you accept the First Circuit's rule in U.S. v. Hood that if the government is found to be attempting to frustrate the operation of the Speedy Trial Act, that those motions and their delays won't be counted? It suggests that qualification? Sanctionable against the government, or-- --How does that help a defendant whose speedy trial rights have been violated? You haven't answered my question. The rights that this statute protects are the rights to have your trial start within 70 days absent or extended to these exclusions. If the government frustrates that and makes the trial start later, why shouldn't a defendant have the benefit of the Act and have the indictment dismissed with or without prejudice? Counsel, I hope you won't sit down without addressing the (h)(1)(F) issue and explain why we shouldn't reach it, because the issue is, as I see it, one of law, not like Nobles, one of discretion. And although you say it's unimportant because of a change in Rule 45, how could any criminal conviction that's inappropriate be unimportant to the defendant or insignificant enough for this Court to address the question once the case is before us? Counsel-- --there's a lot-- --Counsel, there's a lot of discussion about the applicability or nonapplicability of this rule to this case. The rule by its terms applies to computing any period of time specified in these rules, any local rule or any court order. None of that includes the statute at issue here, correct? So this whole debate about whether the rule applies or not is irrelevant. The only question is what does the statute intend, correct? All right. So if what the statute intends hasn't changed-- --between the old rule or the revised rule, correct? Congress hasn't-- --made an amendment; correct? Will you like the way we're going if I accept your proposition that when Congress uses 10 days, it really means 10 business days? I take words in a statute like that at their plain meaning. It says 10 days, not 10 business days. So-- --But Congress has used 10 -- has used business days in other provisions, hasn't it? So Congress changed its mind between the two rules? How do I know that? Where? Rule 45 doesn't apply to statutes. Where in the statute does it -- say, apply the criminal rules? Excuse me, but isn't that what the statute says? Meaning, if you look at (h), the beginning paragraph at (h), it says, ""The following periods of delay shall be excluded in computing the time within which the trial of any such offense must commence. "" It's not talking about the delay of the trial. It's talking about the computation of the start date for the trial. So if that's what that commands you to do, doesn't -- isn't only the Solicitor General's position consistent with that? It's telling you to take the periods of delay and compute the date the trial must start by excluding those. That's the language. That's the-- --Well, but that's what (h) says; (h) says you compute the start date of the trial, when it must start, by excluding all of these periods of delay. It's defining it for you. So it doesn't matter how substantial and important a motion is, whether it was your motion to dismiss for Speedy Trial Act reasons or the administrative motions here that you say really didn't require time? It doesn't matter; all that matters is keeping track from day one, the commencement of the trial, as to when the Court is about to set the trial date, that it does it at the end of all the motions. That's the only time the court can do it. Why wouldn't it matter? Well, actually it happens all the time. In the ""rocket docket"" in Virginia, the court sets a trial date, and you file whatever motions you're going to file. Under your theory, until that last motion actually delays the trial date, none of those motions exclude time. Counsel, I don't believe I had a trial in my district court days where between the time I had the pretrial conference and the time trial started, there wasn't a slew of motions, because that's about the time counsel tends to wake up. Okay? And -- and decide that really now they've got to get ready. Why should we care whether it's an administrative motion or simply to clarify the functioning of the trial? Why should we not exclude those times, because those -- those motions, whether they're administrative or not, will cause the trial to go faster, because issues that would otherwise consume the time of the court during trial are being resolved before trial. ",counsel on that issue do you accept the first circuit s rule in us v hood that if the government be find to be attempt to frustrate the operation of the speedy trial act that those motion and their delay will not be count it suggest that qualification sanctionable against the government or how do that help a defendant whose speedy trial right have be violate you have not answer my question the right that this statute protects be the right to have your trial start within day absent or extend to these exclusion if the government frustrate that and make the trial start later why should not a defendant have the benefit of the act and have the indictment dismiss with or without prejudice counsel i hope you will not sit down without address the h f issue and explain why we should not reach it because the issue be as i see it one of law not like noble one of discretion and although you say it be unimportant because of a change in rule how could any criminal conviction that be inappropriate be unimportant to the defendant or insignificant enough for this court to address the question once the case be before us counsel there be a lot counsel there be a lot of discussion about the applicability or nonapplicability of this rule to this case the rule by its term applies to compute any period of time specify in these rule any local rule or any court order none of that include the statute at issue here correct so this whole debate about whether the rule applies or not be irrelevant the only question be what do the statute intend correct all right so if what the statute intend have not change between the old rule or the revised rule correct congress have not make an amendment correct will you like the way we be go if i accept your proposition that when congress use day it really mean business day i take word in a statute like that at their plain meaning it say day not business day so but congress have use have use business day in other provision have not it so congress change its mind between the two rule how do i know that where rule do not apply to statute where in the statute do it say apply the criminal rule excuse me but be not that what the statute say meaning if you look at h the beginning paragraph at h it say the following period of delay shall be exclude in compute the time within which the trial of any such offense must commence it be not talk about the delay of the trial it be talk about the computation of the start date for the trial so if that be what that command you to do do not be not only the solicitor general s position consistent with that it be tell you to take the period of delay and compute the date the trial must start by exclude those that be the language that be the well but that be what h say h say you compute the start date of the trial when it must start by exclude all of these period of delay it be define it for you so it do not matter how substantial and important a motion be whether it be your motion to dismiss for speedy trial act reason or the administrative motion here that you say really do not require time it do not matter all that matter be keep track from day one the commencement of the trial as to when the court be about to set the trial date that it do it at the end of all the motion that be the only time the court can do it why would not it matter well actually it happen all the time in the rocket docket in virginia the court set a trial date and you file whatever motion you be go to file under your theory until that last motion actually delay the trial date none of those motion exclude time counsel i do not believe i have a trial in my district court day where between the time i have the pretrial conference and the time trial start there be not a slew of motion because that be about the time counsel tend to wake up okay and and decide that really now they have get to get ready why should we care whether it be an administrative motion or simply to clarify the functioning of the trial why should we not exclude those time because those those motion whether they be administrative or not will because the trial to go faster because issue that would otherwise consume the time of the court during trial be be resolve before trial ,330.0099999999999,Roberts Court,"Feb 22, 2011",United States,Jason Louis Tinklenberg,09-1498,"Sep 28, 2010","May 26, 2011",113.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2010,"Janus Capital Group, Inc. v. First Derivative Traders",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, is -- who is the violator alleged here? Not in the complaint, but in the briefs? As I read the briefs, they claim that Janus itself did not make the false statement, that the two appellants did, that they are the actual speakers because they were talking about their activities, and they used Janus as a conduit to deceive the market. That's, I think, what they're alleging. So how do we sustain the intermediary cases when the company, through market analysts, divulges misleading statements? We don't talk about the market analysts' falsity; we talk about the company's falsity, because the market analysts didn't have scienter. Well, what's the difference between an omission or a commission if a company purposely divulges a falsehood to an analyst, knowing it's going to be distributed and told? So who is making the false statement, the analyst or the company? So why isn't -- why aren't the two appellants, on their theory, on -- we can talk about whether the complaint does or does not adequately allege their theory. That's a different issue. I accept that. But under their theory, why isn't the appellants the primary violator, not even a secondary? Because they -- they claim, I think -- and I'm going to find out from them -- that Janus had no scienter, that it didn't make the false statements, that all of this was done in secret by the appellants, so they were the only violator. Do you mean to say to me that puppets become a legal defense for someone who intentionally manipulates the market information? That's the control person statute? But I -- but if Janus had no scienter, if its board of directors did not know that the statements were false, they had no way of knowing, because as I understand the complaint, and this is alleged, the deal was secret. So Janus itself could not be a primary violator. Who is? Even though there was no scheme with another actor? Even though it was the only violator, which is a fair reading of the complaint? Except that I, as I read your brief, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, you were arguing that since there was an independent board of directors, presumably because there are two corporate -- different corporate funds -- two different corporate forms, that there couldn't be control person liability under 20(a). You seem that -- I thought, reading your brief, that's what you were alleging. So you can't have your cake and eat it, too. Either the independence of the board makes no difference or it does, so which is your position? Under what theory would you defend an allegation that the investment manager who had control over the everyday affairs of the company, drafted or helped draft the prospectus, hired the lawyers who helped draft it, wouldn't be a control person? How would you defend that? Exactly. So you -- you're -- if they can't be control persons because they're separate companies, then how do they escape being primary violators? But it's not in this case, because the allegation is that it -- not the company, that it chose to deceive the market. You're -- you're not suggesting, are you, that they did this for purposes of protecting your client from lawsuit? When it -- no, they did it for a business reason, that having separate entities was economically more useful for the market, correct? So -- but that doesn't answer Justice Breyer's question, now. Assuming that they didn't do it for that reason, what does it mean? Is your claim premised on Janus being duped or not? If Janus was not duped, if its board knew and JCM was doing the activity with either the consent or acquiescence of the board, would you have a claim here? Then go back to Justice Breyer's question, because I can see when there's one primary violator who uses another entity as a dupe or as a puppet, but I can't, and I don't know how to distinguish what you're proposing, from aiding and abetting. There has to be something to differentiate the two, so what is it? Counsel, could you start by taking your brief and distilling it down to three sentences? Define what a primary violator is, what a secondary violator is who aids and abets, and who a control person is? And then tell me how that definition would exclude lawyers, auditors, investment -- general investment advisors, et cetera. I've read your brief, but I've been trying to distill it down to three sentences. So try to do that for me. Give me an example of that. What do you see as all of the elements? I understand. But-- --And that becomes -- how is that different from aiding and abetting the making of a statement? But that's every lawyer-- --who writes the false statement knowing it's false.

2010,"Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S.A.",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Why would we -- wouldn't the rule that you're setting forth, willful blindness not being a part of it, mean that nobody would ever get a patent search, because what would be the inducement to do that? No, but you're not presumed to copy other people's items, which is the difference. Is there -- let me just ask you something. Assuming we were to find the willful blindness test to actual knowledge, the facts of your case, the fact that they did not give the name of the product that they copied to their patent attorney, is that just, as a matter of law, willful blindness? Do patents -- are patents -- can you do a patent search on the basis of the name of the holder? And the product that they copied, did it have the name of the holder of the patent? So what is the likelihood that if they had actually given the attorney the name of the product, that he would not have found the patent? I think it would be probably 90 percent, assuming -- because there's always errors in searches. So-- --I'm -- I'm a little confused. If you knew that there was a patent under (b), and you still gave the fryer -- patented the fryer that you know it is a patented fryer to Montgomery Ward or Sunbeam to sell, you're not liable under (b), because why?

If you know there's a patent and you give the product to someone else to sell, how can you not be culpable for it? So you're introducing a mistake of law defense to knowledge. You're saying, I really didn't know that it was unlawful. I knew that there was a patent, but I really thought that it wasn't a legal patent, so I was going to violate what I know wasn't legal. Is that what you're saying? Why do you get off the hook for making a mistake of law? You would never have any patents enforced under your theory. --do so, because we still have to define knowledge.

2010,Mayo Foundation v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Olson, are residents supervised their entire employ, the 80 hours? Is there an attending physician standing over their shoulder and looking at what they are doing? What I -- how I look at this case is: How do you draw the line between a student who is working and a worker who is studying? So the issue for me is: Is the Treasury Department's identification of how to draw that line unreasonable? Do we owe them deference? Let's use the example that's been floating around the briefs: The general counsel of the university who takes classes to increase his knowledge. Is he a student who is working or is he a worker who is studying? Why isn't the general counsel who is going to, let's assume, either three classes a week or six hours of classes is working 40 hours as general counsel, and he's regularly enrolled in classes. Why isn't he part of-- --So why wouldn't common sense lead you to the conclusion that if someone is working 40 unsupervised hours without an attending physician at their side, taking care of patients, that that's really not a student? That's what the Treasury Department is saying. You don't think receiving $50,000 or $60,000 a year is enough to make you an employee of someone? Why isn't that -- assume it's not the general counsel of the university but a lawyer working in the general counsel's office. He's being supervised by the general counsel, his work's being reviewed, and he's attending classes at night. Well, what they want to achieve is a higher long-term pay, but they can go out and work as doctors. I understood that 15 percent of the physicians were not board certified. So how about the architect residents who are working in universities? Are they medical -- like medical residents as well? Well, those five courts did it before -- most of those opinions were rendered before the new regulation. Only one-- --Mr. Olson-- --everyone learns. Aren't you learning today -- sitting here and watching this -- maybe you are not -- your own argument? But the arguments before -- aren't we learning in every case that we're hearing? I -- I-- --It's -- it's, in my mind, difficult to separate out what makes a person or stops a person from learning on a job. At any job, actually.

2010,Tolentino v. New York,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"You're suggesting that it's okay for the police to walk up to any citizen, anywhere, and say, you're under arrest until you give me your name? Well, there's -- there's been no doubt here that it was a stop without suspicion. That's been presumed. So how is that different from what I just asked you-- --That they took a person randomly, detained them without any suspicion, and said give me your name. Are you suggesting that that's okay? I am presuming. I know that there's counter-arguments to that. So isn't the eliciting of the name as a result of an unlawful stop something that could be suppressed? The name is different than the person, the body of the person, which has to do with the Court's jurisdiction. But why isn't the name any different than a wallet that's in somebody's pocket or a shirt or a hat, whatever is on the person? Why is a name not subject to suppression? Let's go past what happens here, because I understand the disconnect between the name, the DMV record, and seeing the person driving. How we tie those together are a different issue. But you made a bold statement when you started. You said that the police securing a name is never suppressible. Counsel, do you see no difference between Crews and Bynum, in the typical case where the evidence against the defendant is not developed as a result of an illegal stop -- it exists independent of that stop -- and one in which the stop itself creates the ground for arrest? Don't you see a difference between those two things? But there was no suspicion of that when that person was stopped. The suspicion to arrest arose not independent of the illegality, but as part of it. But all of the evidence at trial really had nothing to do with the fingerprint. It had to do with the victims and everyone else walking in and saying, That's the guy who did lie to me. In the arrest. Are you-- Counsel, are you agreeing with your adversary that you abandoned and are not entitled to raise the suppressibility of the observation?

2010,Chamber of Commerce of the United States v. Whiting,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Could I -- could I-- --just -- just focus the question? Because we keep talking about whether the APA-type definition of licensing is what Congress intended or not, but you don't disagree that Congress at least intended that if someone violated the Federal law and hired illegal aliens of Hispanic -- undocumented aliens and was found to have violated it, that the State can revoke their license, correct, to do business? So it really doesn't matter whether they are revoking their right to do business in the State. And they can only revoke their charter or their articles of incorporation if they're -- if they were filed in that State. They wouldn't have power to revoke a Delaware-- --All right. So it's stopping them from doing business. So really, the only conflict you are talking about is not the power to stop them from doing business, because you accept that this saving clause gives them the power to do that, to revoke the right to do business. What you are talking about is a conflict in the adjudication of that issue. So I'm -- you know, how they define ""license"" or not is irrelevant to me. Walk me through whether -- what expressly preempts that adjudication right-- --or what implicitly preempts that adjudication right. Because that is, for me, what the center of this question is. But it can't be uniformity of sanction, because the court permitted licensing sanctions. So let's go back to my question of adjudication. What you are saying is what's specifically preempted is the right to adjudicate-- --whether someone has hired undocumented aliens, correct? Your argument sounds to me like, look at the law and see what its purpose is. If the purpose is to regulate undocumented aliens, then it's struck down. If it happens to put its revocation provisions in its licensing law, then its okay. It doesn't make much sense to me. The face of the statute talks only about if you hire undocumented aliens your license is revoked. But the savings clause says that it is okay. Civil or criminal sanctions other than through licensing and similar laws. If we disagree with you, could you answer the question I posed to your adversary, which is what makes the adjudication of status preempted? At the time the statute was passed there were many, many State laws that adjudicated revocation of licenses. Perhaps not many have addressed the issue of hiring undocumented aliens, but many State laws existed that independently adjudicated revocations. What in the legislative history or in the words of the statute show that Congress intended in any way to limit those adjudications? I'm -- doesn't it frustrate the congressional intent when the Federal law says that the I-9 can be used for no purpose other than the Federal adjudication of whether a violation has occurred or not? Doesn't it frustrate that law to have the States raise a defense that depends on forcing someone to disclose something that the Federal law protects? I mean, this is a vicious circle. Federal law says you can't do the I-9, you can't use it for any purpose other than the Federal adjudication. Now you are creating a defense that says, you have to supply us with something that Federal law otherwise protects from disclosure. That doesn't answer my point. Doesn't it frustrate Federal law when the Federal law says that I-9 can be used for no purpose other than the Federal adjudication of the status of employees? I think that's-- --So in answer to Justice Breyer's earlier question, in fact, relying on the I-9 does not provide a safe harbor, because under the E-Verify system you can't just rely on the I-9 forms and statutes. You have to rely on the E-Verify. Wouldn't it be easier, if that is Justice Scalia's concern, to take the Solicitor General's position, that if you are adjudicating good faith or intent differently in any way from the Federal government, that it's granted? Isn't that what waiting for an as-applied challenge means, whether or not you are putting different requirements on proving good faith? Then let me ask the question directly. If Arizona's system does not permit an employer to rely on non-suspect documents, the I-9 documents that are permitted employers to rely on, the Arizona system says, no, you can't rely on those. Is that preempted or not? You can't rely on I-9, or the Arizona system says -- on the I-9 documents. Or the Arizona system says, you can't hire someone who hasn't been approved under the e-verification system. Is that preempted? ",could i could i just just focus the question because we keep talk about whether the apa type definition of licensing be what congress intend or not but you do not disagree that congress at least intend that if someone violate the federal law and hired illegal alien of hispanic undocumented alien and be find to have violate it that the state can revoke their license correct to do business so it really do not matter whether they be revoke their right to do business in the state and they can only revoke their charter or their article of incorporation if they be if they we be file in that state they would not have power to revoke a delaware all right so it be stop them from do business so really the only conflict you be talk about be not the power to stop them from do business because you accept that this save clause give them the power to do that to revoke the right to do business what you be talk about be a conflict in the adjudication of that issue so I be you know how they define license or not be irrelevant to me walk me through whether what expressly preempt that adjudication right or what implicitly preempt that adjudication right because that be for me what the center of this question be but it can not be uniformity of sanction because the court permit licensing sanction so let us go back to my question of adjudication what you be say be what be specifically preempt be the right to adjudicate whether someone have hire undocumented alien correct your argument sound to me like look at the law and see what its purpose be if the purpose be to regulate undocumented alien then it be strike down if it happen to put its revocation provision in its licensing law then its okay it do not make much sense to me the face of the statute talk only about if you hire undocumented alien your license be revoke but the saving clause say that it be okay civil or criminal sanction other than through licensing and similar law if we disagree with you could you answer the question i pose to your adversary which be what make the adjudication of status preempt at the time the statute be pass there we be many many state law that adjudicate revocation of license perhaps not many have address the issue of hire undocumented alien but many state law exist that independently adjudicate revocation what in the legislative history or in the word of the statute show that congress intend in any way to limit those adjudication I be do not it frustrate the congressional intent when the federal law say that the i can be use for no purpose other than the federal adjudication of whether a violation have occur or not do not it frustrate that law to have the state raise a defense that depend on force someone to disclose something that the federal law protects i mean this be a vicious circle federal law say you can not do the i you can not use it for any purpose other than the federal adjudication now you be create a defense that say you have to supply us with something that federal law otherwise protect from disclosure that do not answer my point do not it frustrate federal law when the federal law say that i can be use for no purpose other than the federal adjudication of the status of employee i think that be so in answer to justice breyer s early question in fact rely on the i do not provide a safe harbor because under the e verify system you can not just rely on the i form and statute you have to rely on the e verify would not it be easier if that be justice scalia s concern to take the solicitor general s position that if you be adjudicate good faith or intent differently in any way from the federal government that it be grant be not that what wait for an as applied challenge mean whether or not you be put different requirement on prove good faith then let me ask the question directly if arizona s system do not permit an employer to rely on non suspect document the i document that be permit employer to rely on the arizona system say no you can not rely on those be that preempt or not you can not rely on i or the arizona system say on the i document or the arizona system say you can not hire someone who have not be approve under the e verification system be that preempt ,351.33000000000015,Roberts Court,"Dec 8, 2010","Chamber of Commerce of the United States, et al.","Michael B.

If we impose, in a resentencing, in a remand order that has vacated a prior sentence, a limitation on that power, don't we in turn do exactly what you are arguing in your first half of your appeal, which is unconstitutionally tie the hands of the judge? I think that is what Justice -- the Chief Justice was getting to in his first question. So why isn't a new sentence just that: A new sentence? And the judge, whoever the judge is, can do what they are supposed to do, which is to look at all of the factors and weigh them as that judge believes is appropriate, assuming the remand order is not a limited order. And as far as you are concerned, Justice Alito's question about post -- post-sentencing criminal conduct couldn't be considered by a court, either? Because it wasn't a factor mentioned in the original sentence, so you would apply the rule equally? Is there any logic to that? I mean, I know that when I was a district court judge, routinely post sentencing criminal conduct would make me wonder whether this person really was worthy of a lower sentence or not, or of whatever largesse I may have given him or her in original sentence. What makes sense about that? When this provision was passed, Congress was worried, I thought, about the situations where district court judges has -- were on appeal till -- you can't use this ground for departure, and often the court, because they thought the original sentence they gave was fair, would then articulate another ground for departure that they hadn't earlier. But wouldn't that all go out the window with Booker? I mean, the presumption that drove Congress was that the guidelines were mandatory. Once Booker said they weren't, why should we be limiting Congress -- a judge's discretion at an issue or post hoc to giving what they believe is a reasonable sentence? How many of those statutes are left that the Court hasn't looked at? Which are the three? Would that -- I mean -- we right now are receiving hundreds of petitions saying the court didn't sufficiently articulate its reasons. We're going to change the practice of the district court. I mean, dramatically. You think that's a good thing to do? ",counsel counsel I be I be a little confused i think that the entire premise of booker be that judge should have full discretion under to balance the factor that be require by the statute to be balance and to come to what they believe be the appropriate sentence if we impose in a resentencing in a remand order that have vacate a prior sentence a limitation on that power do not we in turn do exactly what you be argue in your first half of your appeal which be unconstitutionally tie the hand of the judge i think that be what justice the chief justice be get to in his first question so why be not a new sentence just that a new sentence and the judge whoever the judge be can do what they be suppose to do which be to look at all of the factor and weigh them as that judge believe be appropriate assume the remand order be not a limited order and as far as you be concern justice alito s question about post post sentence criminal conduct could not be consider by a court either because it be not a factor mention in the original sentence so you would apply the rule equally be there any logic to that i mean i know that when i be a district court judge routinely post sentence criminal conduct would make me wonder whether this person really be worthy of a low sentence or not or of whatever largesse i may have give him or her in original sentence what make sense about that when this provision be pass congress be worry i think about the situation where district court judge have we be on appeal till you can not use this ground for departure and often the court because they think the original sentence they give be fair would then articulate another ground for departure that they have not earlier but would not that all go out the window with booker i mean the presumption that drive congress be that the guideline we be mandatory once booker say they be not why should we be limit congress a judge s discretion at an issue or post hoc to give what they believe be a reasonable sentence how many of those statute be leave that the court have not look at which be the three would that i mean we right now be receive hundred of petition say the court do not sufficiently articulate its reason we be go to change the practice of the district court i mean dramatically you think that be a good thing to do ,190.47000000000003,Roberts Court,"Dec 6, 2010",Jason Pepper,United States,09-6822,"Jun 28, 2010","Mar 2, 2011",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2010,Harrington v. Richter,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, I don't know that you answered Justice Kennedy's question. I don't know you answered his question. His question was: If you can deny or deny on the merits, what is the difference between the two? And there's two choices, so they have to have different meanings in some way. They showed us the docket for that day-- --of the denial here, and there were different ones. If it's the same court taking action, why would they choose one over the other for particular cases? Well, that's what -- that's feeding into your adversary's argument, that when the court does a summary denial, you don't know whether it's procedural or merits. That's his argument. You're adopting his argument. What was the basis of that? So it took 14 months for this petition to be filed to the State court. Do you have cases that show whether those 14 months are presumptively unreasonable under California law? So there is great validity, you think, to your timeliness, so this timeliness claim. And despite that, you believe the silent denial was an adjudication on the merits. Did they say that? Did they explicitly say in every single case you have to consult an expert? Or did they say the circumstances of this case, given the nature of the issues, that consultation would have been effective? We could take issue with the timing of that consultation, but let's assume that it turns out afterwards that if he had consulted an expert, that that expert would have told him that one of those blood spots absolutely had to be Klein's near the bedroom. You would have no quarrel with saying it would have been ineffective for that counsel to have failed to confer with an expert, wouldn't you? You would say, even if the expert were to -- an expert would have given that kind of exculpatory information, that that would not have been ineffective? I'm not talking -- I gave you a hypothetical different from the facts of this case. I take the Ninth Circuit to be saying, if you are in an area, and you are a lawyer, where you have no expertise and your case depends on a technical issue, it behooves you to at least talk to an expert to find out if you are on the right track. And if you fail to and you get something that's completely exculpatory, you are ineffective. So I posed the hypothetical: If an expert would have looked at all of these test results and said, that has to be Klein's blood there, it can't be Johnson's for this reason, you are positing that even under that circumstance there would not have been ineffectiveness for the failure to consult with an expert? Is that what you are telling us? You keep wanting to return to this case, and I respect why you want to, but I am positing a hypothetical that underlies, I think, the Ninth Circuit's point. It may well be in this case that the consultation would have resulted in no prejudice. That's different from whether it was effective to ignore a consultation. Those are two different questions. Mr.-- --Counsel, there is a lot of talk about the importance of this pool of blood, but as I read Detective Bell's testimony, he never posited or talks about how that pool was formed. Only your expert knows that. What Bell does talk about, however, is that there's a high-velocity blood splatter in front of the couch and that the pooling of blood on Klein's face shows that he was shot there. Your experts do nothing to refute that testimony, which was really the basis of Bell's testimony. He had nothing to say about the pool of blood. He talked about why Klein was shot where he was shot. And there is no expert testimony to refute that. So how do you get past there being a reasonable probability of a different verdict when there is nothing to refute the critical testimony at issue, that Klein was shot where he was shot because there's high-velocity blood splatter in front of him and because the pooling on his face shows that? Could you explain the blood pooling in the face for me? You talk about the high-velocity. I'm having a very hard time with your reliance on that footnote because the very last paragraph of that footnote says when Respondent's asserts, and I'm shortening the introductory line, a State procedural bar and when nevertheless our order disposing of a habeas corpus decision does not impose the proposed bar or bars as to that claim, that signifies that we considered Respondent's assertion and have determined that the claim or subclaim is not barred on the procedural ground. So the footnote itself says unless we invoke the procedural bar we are not applying it. Right. What others could apply in this case? It wasn't part of the cert, the question, we added the question. No, no. I'm saying they didn't raise it to start with, we added the question. So it wasn't as if they were trying to get around their own waiver? ",counsel i do not know that you answer justice kennedy s question i do not know you answer his question his question be if you can deny or deny on the merit what be the difference between the two and there be two choice so they have to have different meaning in some way they show us the docket for that day of the denial here and there we be different one if it be the same court take action why would they choose one over the other for particular case well that be what that be feed into your adversary s argument that when the court do a summary denial you do not know whether it be procedural or merit that be his argument you be adopt his argument what be the basis of that so it take month for this petition to be file to the state court do you have case that show whether those month be presumptively unreasonable under california law so there be great validity you think to your timeliness so this timeliness claim and despite that you believe the silent denial be an adjudication on the merit do they say that do they explicitly say in every single case you have to consult an expert or do they say the circumstance of this case give the nature of the issue that consultation would have be effective we could take issue with the timing of that consultation but let us assume that it turn out afterwards that if he have consult an expert that that expert would have tell him that one of those blood spot absolutely have to be klein s near the bedroom you would have no quarrel with say it would have be ineffective for that counsel to have fail to confer with an expert would not you you would say even if the expert we be to an expert would have give that kind of exculpatory information that that would not have be ineffective I be not talk i give you a hypothetical different from the fact of this case i take the ninth circuit to be say if you be in an area and you be a lawyer where you have no expertise and your case depend on a technical issue it behoove you to at least talk to an expert to find out if you be on the right track and if you fail to and you get something that be completely exculpatory you be ineffective so i pose the hypothetical if an expert would have look at all of these test result and say that have to be klein s blood there it can not be johnson s for this reason you be posit that even under that circumstance there would not have be ineffectiveness for the failure to consult with an expert be that what you be tell us you keep want to return to this case and i respect why you want to but i be posit a hypothetical that underlie i think the ninth circuit s point it may well be in this case that the consultation would have result in no prejudice that be different from whether it be effective to ignore a consultation those be two different question mr counsel there be a lot of talk about the importance of this pool of blood but as i read detective bell s testimony he never posit or talk about how that pool be form only your expert know that what bell do talk about however be that there be a high velocity blood splatter in front of the couch and that the pooling of blood on klein s face show that he be shoot there your expert do nothing to refute that testimony which be really the basis of bell s testimony he have nothing to say about the pool of blood he talk about why klein be shoot where he be shoot and there be no expert testimony to refute that so how do you get past there be a reasonable probability of a different verdict when there be nothing to refute the critical testimony at issue that klein be shoot where he be shoot because there be high velocity blood splatter in front of him and because the pooling on his face show that could you explain the blood pooling in the face for me you talk about the high velocity I be have a very hard time with your reliance on that footnote because the very last paragraph of that footnote say when respondent s asserts and I be shorten the introductory line a state procedural bar and when nevertheless our order disposing of a habeas corpus decision do not impose the propose bar or bar as to that claim that signify that we consider respondent s assertion and have determine that the claim or subclaim be not bar on the procedural ground so the footnote itself say unless we invoke the procedural bar we be not apply it right what others could apply in this case it be not part of the cert the question we add the question no no I be say they do not raise it to start with we add the question so it be not as if they we be try to get around their own waiver ,317.54,Roberts Court,"Oct 12, 2010","Kelly Harrington, Warden",Joshua Richter,09-587,"Feb 22, 2010","Jan 19, 2011",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2010,Davis v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"You've just raised the question of qualified immunity and the similarities. There is one problem that I have with the regime that you are suggesting, which is that because laws differ among circuits, now we've created a regime where we say if the law was clear or if there was law on this issue in your circuit, and the police officer relied on it, the exclusionary rule won't apply; but if the law was uncertain or not clear in another circuit, then the exclusionary rule does apply. There's something illogical about permitting that kind of difference to control the outcome of suppression. Are you through the back door trying to get in a qualified immunity thing? If any police officer has a reasonable cause to believe their conduct didn't violate the Constitution, then no suppression? That is what it sounds like your brief is ultimately suggesting. So there's no value in your mind to the fact, as your adversary is saying -- I don't -- I haven't found one case previously by this Court where it has applied the good faith exception to the finding by the Court of a Fourth Amendment violation. Have you? It's never been done in any case, correct? Well, what we're doing is sort of -- your adversary is right, we're returning to Linkletter, aren't we? We're sort of saying it's going to apply, the exclusionary rule is going to apply in some cases, but not all. I'm talking about what happened before then. We're going to have the exclusionary rule apply sometimes but not other times. Well, if there's a circuit split, how do we encourage police officers to be careful about the Fourth Amendment? There's a presumption somehow that because a circuit precedent exists that says it's okay to do this, that police officers have to do this. I don't necessarily believe that. If there's a circuit split and a police officer knows that other circuits are saying this is unconstitutional, why are we taking away the deterrent effect of having thoughts occur to the officer about thinking through whether there's a better way and a legal way to do things? With respect to the Fourth Amendment, we've built -- your adversary is right, we've built in so many exceptions, and including in this case the inventory search, that the officers have many different ways of doing things than merely doing what this particular court thought was legal or this circuit. So I guess my question is, when there's a circuit split, why are we, as Justice Kennedy is saying, giving protection to the circuit that's plain wrong and to the officer who chose to follow that advice? But they're going to be protected -- they're going to be protected from that-- --meaning they're going to get qualified immunity from any personal liability. ",you have just raise the question of qualified immunity and the similarity there be one problem that i have with the regime that you be suggest which be that because law differ among circuit now we have create a regime where we say if the law be clear or if there be law on this issue in your circuit and the police officer rely on it the exclusionary rule will not apply but if the law be uncertain or not clear in another circuit then the exclusionary rule do apply there be something illogical about permit that kind of difference to control the outcome of suppression be you through the back door try to get in a qualified immunity thing if any police officer have a reasonable because to believe their conduct do not violate the constitution then no suppression that be what it sound like your brief be ultimately suggest so there be no value in your mind to the fact as your adversary be say i do not i have not find one case previously by this court where it have apply the good faith exception to the finding by the court of a fourth amendment violation have you it be never be do in any case correct well what we be do be sort of your adversary be right we be return to linkletter be not we we be sort of say it be go to apply the exclusionary rule be go to apply in some case but not all I be talk about what happen before then we be go to have the exclusionary rule apply sometimes but not other time well if there be a circuit split how do we encourage police officer to be careful about the fourth amendment there be a presumption somehow that because a circuit precedent exist that say it be okay to do this that police officer have to do this i do not necessarily believe that if there be a circuit split and a police officer know that other circuit be say this be unconstitutional why be we take away the deterrent effect of have thought occur to the officer about think through whether there be a good way and a legal way to do thing with respect to the fourth amendment we have build your adversary be right we have build in so many exception and include in this case the inventory search that the officer have many different way of do thing than merely do what this particular court thought be legal or this circuit so i guess my question be when there be a circuit split why be we as justice kennedy be say give protection to the circuit that be plain wrong and to the officer who choose to follow that advice but they be go to be protect they be go to be protect from that meaning they be go to get qualified immunity from any personal liability ,204.6,Roberts Court,"Mar 21, 2011",Willie Gene Davis,United States,09-11328,"Nov 1, 2010","Jun 16, 2011",113.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2010,Wall v. Kholi,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Would Rule 35 permit a challenge for a Federal violation? You have given an example of an illegal sentence that you think is discretionary; am I correct? But does Rule 35(a) permit a legal challenge of the kind that Justice Kagan was asking? All right. Let's assume a pure legal challenge. Would Rule 35(a) be other collateral relief, as designated by the statute? So explain again why you don't think this is collateral? No, no, no. Why is Rule 35, assuming it's a challenge to an illegal sentence on a legal ground-- --Why would it not be collateral review? And if there is no justification, what do they do? Do you quarrel with a statement in Mallacone, a Rhode Island 2000 decision that says: ""We will interfere with the trial court's discretion vis a vis sentencing only in rare instances where the trial justice has imposed a sentence that is without justification and is grossly disparate from the other sentences generally imposed for similar offenses? "" Is that the review standard? That is the standard of review. So please explain to me why that is not what Justice Kennedy described as a review for abuse of discretion and why a review for abuse of discretion is not a legal challenge? I'm sorry. Am I misunderstanding? Are you saying that the Rhode Island appellate courts never change a sentence under Rule 35? Or are you saying that they do find some lack of justification? So a petitioner in the future in Rhode Island should file a petition that says: I'm filing a motion pursuant to 35(a) for an illegal sentence, make something up? Or for leniency. And then are district courts supposed to figure out whether the legal challenge was frivolous or not or had a basis in law or fact-- --and then decide whether they would toll or not toll based on that now side trial on what's an illegal sentence and what's just a plea for leniency? That's what you are proposing? So what if they say ""correct the illegal sentence because it was an abuse of discretion? "" So is the magic words ""illegal sentence"" or is the magic words ""abuse"" -- what are the magic words? I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand that. There is nothing in this rule that bars a litigant from filing after the conviction is final. They have 120 days. I -- your adversary said the contrary, and I was -- you are flip-flopping. Can this be brought on a direct appeal or not? An illegal sentence? So what did you mean when you answered the Chief Justice that it could be brought in collateral proceedings? That's -- just so your adversary, when he gets up on rebuttal can confirm or not this point, any challenge to an illegal sentence has to be brought first with a Rule 35(a) a motion, regardless of what the grounds of illegality are? There seems to be some confusion. Judgment is rendered before this motion is made. There is a conviction and there is a sentence, right? So there is a judgment rendered. That's different from whether the judgment is final in a Federal sense. It's final as far as the State is concerned, because the judgment was rendered, correct? But if there is no appeal, it was final the day it was rendered. As far as the State is concerned. If there is an appeal, then it may undo that, correct? So there is a judgment and this is always post-judgment. I'm sorry, I -- you were speaking so fast, I didn't follow you. Perhaps we can go back to the simple question, which is, can a defendant who has been sentenced bring a challenge to a sentence in a direct appeal, or not? Or do they have to go by Rule 35(a)? Okay. So now we get to the point where some can go under 35(a) but some can't. So they should go on direct appeal, correct? I'm totally confused. If this is part of the criminal proceeding, which is your position, that it's not collateral, but it's part of the proceedings, when does this proceeding become final? That -- that truly -- because -- you're-- --But if the Rhode Island court has told litigants that they can't challenge some portions of an illegal sentence except by way of Rule 35, how can we call the decision on the affirmance of the conviction a final determination of legality of the sentence? That's contradictory. That's not what it says. It talks about a judgment. And a judgment in other terms is usually the conviction and the sentence. Rhode Island for its own reasons has separated the two.

2010,Virginia Office for Protection and Advocacy v. Stewart,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Why is that true? If they are separate corporate entities, what legal rule would stop a separate corporate entity from suing another? Is there -- if they are part of the same company, I think that's a different issue. If they are the same company, that's a different issue and just a different branch or a different office. Counsel, I'm not quite sure what the premise of your argument is. You seem to be arguing that the independence of the state agency is what makes this particular entity capable of suing. Yet in your brief you rely on Verizon's simple test, which says if you are asserting a Federal claim you can sue and you're not -- and you are looking for prospective injunctive relief; you can sue the State. That general rule wouldn't look at who's suing. That was part of your argument. Yet now you are arguing the independence of the agency. Which is your position. And if it is the one about the State's independence, how do you articulate why that becomes important or not? What's the legal significance of that vis-a-vis this case and any ones moving forward? Counsel, following up on Justice Scalia's question to you, his question in fact is in part what happened here. Virginia at some point did require every State agency to seek the permission of its attorney general, is it, to sue? And the government said that's not independent enough, and if you want the money you've got to make VOPA eligible to sue without that permission; is that correct? Could you be a little bit more specific for me on what you mean about an Article 3 problem? Justice Kennedy was concerned about State attorney generals willy-nilly suing -- or not willy-nilly, suing governors to comply with Federal law. Why do you think it won't happen, and what are the legal impediments to that occurring? I'm sorry, I think there are concepts being confused. There is no question that it hasn't waived sovereign immunity. VOPA doesn't claim that. And this is not a direct suit against the State, it's a suit against a State official. And the entire premise of Ex parte Young is that this doesn't offend sovereign immunity for a party to seek enforcement, prospectively, of a Federal right. So I don't know why it really matters who the Plaintiff is so long as the sovereign interests that we recognized, that the issue of sovereignty is one that respects a State's coffers and State's laws and we are not going to interfere with any of them, but we are going to ensure that because of the preemptive effect of the Constitution and our laws that Federal laws are respected. So what's in this case the intrusion on State sovereignty when the State knew and consented consciously to letting VOPA sue for records when it needed to? The State should have expected that. It hasn't happened. Why do you think? Don't you think it hasn't happened because there are so many practical political restraints on that kind of activity? What would happen I think in that State where there was a rogue attorney general is somebody would win; the governor would win by getting a legislative act that says it can't be done, or the attorney general will win because the political sentiments are so strong in his or her favor that the suit is actually welcomed by the population. So where is the intrusion on sovereignty? States do what they want. The only issue is how do we protect Federal rights. I'm not sure that -- what you are forgetting is that Virginia took a lot of money to set up and get the benefits of Federal funds by creating an independent agency. It had expressed its desire to control the agency more, and it was told very directly: You can't. You have to let that agency sue. What I don't understand is why you think that it's a greater affront to sovereignty that the suit is here as opposed to State court. The State has already said: We're going to take your money and this is what we're going to permit, a suit. But we use -- we don't bring the State in.

2010,United States v. Jicarilla Apache Nation,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, all of the statutes relating to these funds use the word ""trust"". Not one statute defines trust and says in any way this is not a fiduciary relationship. To the contrary, in fact, most of the statutes require what would be consistent with fiduciary obligations, and at least one of them that you rely on says ""but not limited to"". So the issue before us doesn't involve a competing sovereign interest by the U.S. You've conceded that in your cert petition. The circuit below said this is not a case where there is an independent sovereign issue governing the U.S. activities. Just explain to me what's the rationale that would permit a trustee of a trust fund to withhold from the beneficiary the kinds of documents that relate to the management of the fund? If the funds exist for the benefit of the Indian tribe, why aren't they entitled to management documents? That's the part that doesn't make -- that you're not explaining. But in both -- in all of those cases, counsel, it was a limitation related to competing interests, meaning it was recognizing that there are potentially moments in which an attorney is acting both in the interest of the government and in the interest of the tribe. But that was a jurisdictional question, not a question with respect to -- to the -- to the obligation. You're not seriously suggesting that if you're a trustee of an Indian fund that you can breach your fiduciary duty by simply not exercising care in your investment strategies. So some form of -- of duty exists. --from the common law, and the common law has to define that. And so why would, if it imposes those duties, protect you from disclosing items that might -- attorney confidences that go to that very act, the very act of investing in the way, even under your definition, that the trust requires you to? But this argument, frankly, would be -- we wouldn't have any need for 501, because if as an evidentiary rule the government is always different, then there is no situation in which fiduciary duties in common law would ever exist. Is there -- is there any greater value to a fiduciary duty than to manage the account for the benefit of the beneficiary? That's the very essence of what a trust means, and so I'm having a hard time understanding not a competing interest situation where you're addressing a different statutory requirement, but merely -- and that's what this case was presented as, merely the management of the trust. So what you're, it seems to me, you're arguing is there is no duty. You're saying it's all defined by statute only, but you're rendering -- there's no need to use the word ""trust"" because it wouldn't be a trust. There were no prospective, is that -- did you-- But aren't you confusing, just following up on the Chief Justice's, ownership with access? FOIA itself doesn't make these records less -- the government doesn't own them less merely because FOIA requires them to share it with other people. So the ownership interest is not the defining legal obligation. ",counsel all of the statute relate to these fund use the word trust not one statute define trust and say in any way this be not a fiduciary relationship to the contrary in fact most of the statute require what would be consistent with fiduciary obligation and at least one of them that you rely on say but not limit to so the issue before us do not involve a compete sovereign interest by the us you have concede that in your cert petition the circuit below say this be not a case where there be an independent sovereign issue govern the us activity just explain to me what be the rationale that would permit a trustee of a trust fund to withhold from the beneficiary the kind of document that relate to the management of the fund if the fund exist for the benefit of the indian tribe why be not they entitle to management document that be the part that do not make that you be not explain but in both in all of those case counsel it be a limitation relate to compete interest mean it be recognize that there be potentially moment in which an attorney be act both in the interest of the government and in the interest of the tribe but that be a jurisdictional question not a question with respect to to the to the obligation you be not seriously suggest that if you be a trustee of an indian fund that you can breach your fiduciary duty by simply not exercise care in your investment strategy so some form of of duty exists from the common law and the common law have to define that and so why would if it impose those duty protect you from disclose item that might attorney confidence that go to that very act the very act of invest in the way even under your definition that the trust require you to but this argument frankly would be we would not have any need for because if as an evidentiary rule the government be always different then there be no situation in which fiduciary duty in common law would ever exist be there be there any great value to a fiduciary duty than to manage the account for the benefit of the beneficiary that be the very essence of what a trust mean and so I be have a hard time understand not a compete interest situation where you be address a different statutory requirement but merely and that be what this case be present as merely the management of the trust so what you be it seem to me you be argue be there be no duty you be say it be all define by statute only but you be render there be no need to use the word trust because it would not be a trust there we be no prospective be that do you but be not you confuse just follow up on the chief justice s ownership with access foia itself do not make these record less the government do not own them less merely because foia require them to share it with other people so the ownership interest be not the defining legal obligation ,236.16000000000003,Roberts Court,"Apr 20, 2011",United States,Jicarilla Apache Nation,10-382,"Jan 7, 2011","Jun 13, 2011",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2010,Nevada Commission on Ethics v. Carrigan,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, just to clarify this issue, because I don't know that I've heard you state it explicitly, the second part of this recusal statute that bars the advocacy of a measure in which there's an interest prohibited by the statute, it is your position that's advocacy in the legislative body? So it's only limited to getting up on the floor and talking about that? That person can still go outside and give all the press releases they want? What do we do with cases like Miller v. Town of Hull and Colson v. Grohman that have recognized retaliation claims because of speeches given during the casting of a vote? Would those cases still be viable if we decide that there is no First Amendment right in voting? How is that different from the minority people in the Chief Justice's? It only affects them when they're in the minority? So it only affects somebody if they fall within the strictures of the statute? Did you argue associational rights below? Why do you think the court didn't address it? Because it relied on the First Amendment analysis? If the relationship wasn't particularly special, no more special than any other political volunteer, why did that become front page news? And if your client didn't have a suspicion that he was on the edge of a law, why did he bother going to the city attorney to get an opinion?

2010,Ortiz v. Jordan,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"That answer is not addressing Justice Alito's point, which he said a Rule 50 motion is not jurisdictional. You are in essence claiming it is. You are saying they lacked the power, but Justice Alito's question to you said they don't, that they've misread the fact that this is not a jurisdictional motion. So address that question: Why is it jurisdictional as opposed to a claim processing? In claim processing rules we have said that, unless you object, the court doesn't lack power. Since you didn't object below to a argument that Rule 50(b) precluded consideration by the court of appeals, why wasn't that argument waived before the court? It just -- just finish: Because if Ms. Jordan had reported the incident that she was required to, they would have put Ms. Ortiz in segregation automatically; is that it? So that we should -- I think what that means to me is that you really ignore whether it was raised at summary judgment. If you are going to look at the evidence at trial, what do we look at, at trial, to see that the claim of qualified immunity was preserved? Because it's a little illogical to say you're reviewing the summary judgment record when you're not. What was that instruction? Do you have a cite to the record? How -- could you-- --Could -- could you articulate for me the line that you see between assuming all of the facts and it's not enough as a matter of law, and a sufficiency claim. And let's break out the two claims: one against Ms. Jordan, one against Ms. Bright. On the due process claim against Ms. Bright there are two prongs I think to your argument. One is that as a matter of law under Sandin putting her in solitary confinement did not violate any -- any constitutional right. And then there's ""she didn't retaliate"" part of your claim. The two seemed mixed up to me below. And I thought in reading your submissions to the district court you were saying that if she retaliated in putting her in segregated confinement, it doesn't matter whether there is a Sandin violation or not; she couldn't do the retaliatory act; is that correct? The First Amendment. I'm trying to separate out your-- --your argument, however. What is your -- what is your position on this question? How is that-- --Is that the -- that is what the Chief Justice asked you earlier. Why is that such a horrible thing? You -- I'm not sure that answers the question. Isn't it better for the Court of Appeals to know a district court's opinion on every issue that's going to come up on appeal, and wouldn't our announcement of the rule -- that whether it's an issue of law or fact, it has to be renewed under 50(b), so everybody's on the same page as to what's going to be heard on appeal -- why is that a bad rule? Why would that be a bad outcome as a matter of law? What's the rule you want us to adopt to answer the question presented? You asked us to take cert on a question presented. What is the answer you want us to give on the question presented? In no circumstances?

2010,Astra USA v. Santa Clara County,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I don't understand that. A private contract is just that. Two parties go into the contract. They set the terms of their deal. No one forced the manufacturers to enter into this deal. So why isn't the issue exactly what the circuit court said: What was the intent of the parties to the contract? You want to make it Congress's intent, but this is a private deal between them. And Congress may have specified some terms to include; but-- --How do you answer the point that, if Congress wanted to make this a pure regulatory statute, it wouldn't have even required a contract? It would have just passed a statute that says anyone who wants to -- to sell to the -- to the States or to the 340B entities, you can't charge more than this price? Why do we even need a contract, unless inherent with it is some discretion in the agency who's administering it? --discretion that is consistent with normal contract principles? Your adversary claims you gave up your argument that the contract doesn't make the manufacturers a third-party intended beneficiary. Have you given up that argument? Counsel, are you telling me you're taking -- then you're co-counsel is right; you're agreeing with her totally -- if Congress wrote the statute, said these are the terms we want to give you in a contract, you figure out how to implement and enforce this, the Secretary says I don't have the resources to enforce this, I'm going to write a contract that gives the 340B entities a private cause of action, the manufacturers can take it or leave it, you're taking the position that the Secretary is without authority to do this? Well, that begs the exception that Justice Alito asked you, which is if we go your route, which is, is this a regulatory or some sort of other contract, how do we tell the difference, and do we need to go that far? Isn't your position -- I thought the other half of your position was that this is not a third-party intended beneficiary. All the terms of the contract are between the manufacturer and the Secretary and the obligations to the Secretary, not the obligations to the third parties. You're walking away from your position in the District of Massachusetts? The States do not have, according to you, the right to enforce the rebate program? An implied cause of action? Is that what you're saying those state suits are? How is that regulatory scheme any different from the one involving the PPA? So I understand your position clearly, In a regulatory contract situation like this one the Secretary is without authority to decide he or she can't enforce the statute and to confer expressly by contract third-party beneficiary rights to the -- to the people receiving the benefit? That's the position you're taking? If the Secretary had written a provision into this contract telling 340B entities you can sue, that would have been, according to you, ultra vires? Could you tell me where-- --Third-party beneficiaries -- I'm sorry. Counsel -- I'm sorry. I don't understand the distinction that you are ignoring in the law. I thought it was very clear that proof that you merely received the benefit by a contract is not proof that the parties intended to confer on you an enforceable right; is that correct? Is that the statement of the common law? No matter how-- --No matter how you want to draw this line, if the issue is, what's the objective intents about enforceability, if I look at the PPA, it makes the manufacturer's obligation one-way to the government to provide the pricing information. It gives only the government the right to institute the formal dispute resolution system that the contract specifies. This is not the new law. This is the PPA as it existed at the time. It gives only the Secretary other enforcement rights. What am I missing? Where in the contract is there one provision, one sentence, one anything that requires the manufacturers, other than the price benefit, to do something that could be characterized as enforcement? ",i do not understand that a private contract be just that two party go into the contract they set the term of their deal no one force the manufacturer to enter into this deal so why be not the issue exactly what the circuit court say what be the intent of the party to the contract you want to make it congress s intent but this be a private deal between them and congress may have specify some term to include but how do you answer the point that if congress want to make this a pure regulatory statute it would not have even require a contract it would have just pass a statute that say anyone who want to to sell to the to the state or to the b entity you can not charge more than this price why do we even need a contract unless inherent with it be some discretion in the agency who be administer it discretion that be consistent with normal contract principle your adversary claim you give up your argument that the contract do not make the manufacturer a third party intend beneficiary have you give up that argument counsel be you tell me you be take then you be co counsel be right you be agree with her totally if congress write the statute say these be the term we want to give you in a contract you figure out how to implement and enforce this the secretary say i do not have the resource to enforce this I be go to write a contract that give the b entity a private because of action the manufacturer can take it or leave it you be take the position that the secretary be without authority to do this well that beg the exception that justice alito ask you which be if we go your route which be be this a regulatory or some sort of other contract how do we tell the difference and do we need to go that far be not your position i think the other half of your position be that this be not a third party intend beneficiary all the term of the contract be between the manufacturer and the secretary and the obligation to the secretary not the obligation to the third party you be walk away from your position in the district of massachusetts the state do not have accord to you the right to enforce the rebate program an implied because of action be that what you be say those state suit be how be that regulatory scheme any different from the one involve the ppa so i understand your position clearly in a regulatory contract situation like this one the secretary be without authority to decide he or she can not enforce the statute and to confer expressly by contract third party beneficiary right to the to the people receive the benefit that be the position you be take if the secretary have write a provision into this contract tell b entity you can sue that would have be accord to you ultra vires could you tell me where third party beneficiary I be sorry counsel I be sorry i do not understand the distinction that you be ignore in the law i think it be very clear that proof that you merely receive the benefit by a contract be not proof that the party intend to confer on you an enforceable right be that correct be that the statement of the common law no matter how no matter how you want to draw this line if the issue be what be the objective intent about enforceability if i look at the ppa it make the manufacturer s obligation one way to the government to provide the pricing information it give only the government the right to institute the formal dispute resolution system that the contract specifies this be not the new law this be the ppa as it exist at the time it give only the secretary other enforcement right what be i missing where in the contract be there one provision one sentence one anything that require the manufacturer other than the price benefit to do something that could be characterize as enforcement ,296.9500000000001,Roberts Court,"Jan 19, 2011",Astra USA,"Santa Clara County, Calif.",09-1273,"Sep 28, 2010","Mar 29, 2011",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2010,Skinner v. Switzer,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I'm sorry. What's the rule that is arbitrary and capricious that you are challenging? Could you tell me how that's different than what Alaska did in the Osborne case that we upheld their procedure? I thought that was one of the elements of the Alaska rule as well. That if you had an opportunity to ask for it and gave it up, that you lost. So how are we getting to that here? How are you going to get past Osborne here? Are you-- --Are you -- one of the criticisms by your adversary of your proposal to bring these actions via 1983 is a prospect that the courts will be used to collaterally attack convictions by all sorts of due process allegations concerning discovery disputes. Could you address that point, and why either you agree with them that that's going to happen, or if you don't, why not? What would you do with the Brady violation? Is that a ""necessarily implies"" or is that more akin to your claim? Substantive right in Brady was to have that material at trial, so that is the substantive constitutional right. Here the substantive right that's been identified in Osborne is the liberty interest created by State law. And that only happens after the conviction. So it's not quite the same. It's not comparable. Mr. Coleman, the habeas statute says, 2254(a), a Federal court can entertain a habeas petition only on the ground that the petitioner is in custody in violation of Federal law. Tell me how he can write a complaint that says the violation, due process violation of access to DNA, means that this defendant is in custody in violation of Federal law as opposed to having had a statutory right improperly denied him. Tell me how does he write that complaint to get into habeas? Why is he in custody in -- in violation of Federal law? Because of the improper-- --But that's not his claim here. His claim here is that he was denied DNA evidence improperly under State law in violation of Federal -- the Federal Constitution. So that means FOIA requests, where your only purpose is to seek out the police files because you are hoping, just like you are in DNA testing, that those files will show exculpatory material. Then FOIA requests have to be brought in habeas as well. Where-- --Mr. Owen, I know I am pushing you, but I really would like a clear statement of what the procedural due process violation which you are claiming occurred here is? You are not-- --Then let me follow this through. You are not attacking the constitutionality of Article 64 on its face, right? Or are you? Are you saying -- and that's -- this is where I have difficulty. That by failing to acknowledge Petitioner's ineffective assistance of counsel claim, that that was the court's error? That that was a good enough excuse to excuse the fact that he didn't do DNA -- DNA testing at the time of trial? Because that's what the statute says. You can't get it if it was present at the time and -- meaning if that actual test that you are seeking was available at the time of trial, or you don't prove that you couldn't have done it for a good reason. So what is it exactly that the court did in applying this that was unconstitutional? Wait a minute. That's what the statute says. The statute gives the conditions under which a Petitioner can seek DNA evidence, and it said you didn't meet those conditions. I'm still trying to figure out what you are arguing was the procedural due process violation in their application of those items. So are you challenging it facially or are you challenging it as applied, but as applied how? And so what do you think-- --What is it about what they said it means that is unconstitutional? I'm not even sure what that argument ties to, because I thought what the court said was, this DNA testing was available then. You could have gotten it. Strategically your trial attorney chose not to, and so that disqualifies you from seeking it now. I'm not quite sure what the date of the statute's passage, whether it makes any difference, because -- because why?

But with respect to this particular provision, they were also concerned about economic effect that -- that happened to everyone, men and women, who became disabled. And so they appear to have had dual motivation. Part of the bill was gender-related, part of the bill seemed to be disability-related. What do -- how do we judge that kind of bill, where Congress may have been expanding the benefits it's giving to people, not solely because of gender discrimination, but because of this desire to address disability discrimination? Can I -- I'm sorry. But, there certainly was -- there was certainly much conversation and testimony that, whether they in fact took the same amount of leave time or not, that women who were pregnant or were perceived as capable of getting pregnant were hired less frequently because subjectively the employers thought that they were more likely to take the time. So, frankly, for years there was questions about whether law firms were hiring young -- not hiring young women because they feared they would leave in the middle of a big case or something else. We all know those stories, so it is sort of common knowledge in many ways, but there was plenty of testimony related to that. So assume that that was Congress's perception, because it was supported by the record or as much of the record as Hibbs recognized as adequate. Where does that leave your argument? I thought Justice Alito was trying to help you. I'm working from a different proposition than you are in response to this question. I don't think that the actual amount of time that men and women take is relevant. The question is: What is the employer's perception, and did Congress have a valid basis, as Justice Kagan pointed out earlier, to believe that employers thought women took more time. ",counselor i i take your argument but if you look at the legislative record the report the finding et cetera and the statement repeatedly by many congresspeople there appear to be have be a dual motive for this provision they we be in fact engage in the question of discrimination against pregnant woman that be recognize in hibbs and that be clear but with respect to this particular provision they we be also concern about economic effect that that happen to everyone men and woman who become disabled and so they appear to have have dual motivation part of the bill be gender relate part of the bill seem to be disability relate what do how do we judge that kind of bill where congress may have be expand the benefit it be give to people not solely because of gender discrimination but because of this desire to address disability discrimination can i I be sorry but there certainly be there be certainly much conversation and testimony that whether they in fact take the same amount of leave time or not that woman who we be pregnant or we be perceive as capable of get pregnant we be hire less frequently because subjectively the employer think that they we be more likely to take the time so frankly for year there be question about whether law firm we be hire young not hire young woman because they fear they would leave in the middle of a big case or something else we all know those story so it be sort of common knowledge in many way but there be plenty of testimony relate to that so assume that that be congress s perception because it be support by the record or as much of the record as hibbs recognize as adequate where do that leave your argument i think justice alito be try to help you I be work from a different proposition than you be in response to this question i do not think that the actual amount of time that men and woman take be relevant the question be what be the employer s perception and do congress have a valid basis as justice kagan point out earlier to believe that employer think woman take more time ,162.93,Roberts Court,"Jan 11, 2012",Daniel Coleman,Court of Appeals of Maryland,10-1016,"Jun 27, 2011","Mar 20, 2012",113.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2011,United States v. Home Concrete & Supply,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"But that -- but that argument hasn't changed between the predecessor statute and this statute. You made the same argument under the Colony statute. It lost. So you can't go back to that argument because it's already been rejected. So what goes from that? My problem with your argument as I read it in the brief, it's a bit convoluted, as Justice Scalia observed. But if Congress intended to change Colony, it wouldn't just have created this subdivision (i); it would have changed the main statement. So why don't we read this as simply saying: We accept whatever Colony said, and the only thing we're creating exceptions around are the following. The exception argument-- A real estate developer in the business of buying and selling property. So I'm not sure that I buy your argument that it can't be goods and services, because that was the services of this particular company. Well, they can't -- they can't change the interpretation of the statute, but they are the agency with expertise to define a term within a statute. Why don't they have the expertise to define either what the words ""gross income"" mean or don't mean? Presumptively because you're saying that this is a new interpretation. But the IRS is taking the position that the meaning hasn't changed; that it's just clarifying some ambiguity that the courts have had; not that it's had. There's too many presumptions in your answer. The first is that Colony controls-- --which to me itself says it's not -- it's not interpreting the new statute-- --whatever its footnote meant.

2011,Vartelas v. Holder,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"The career criminal enhancements, instead of the felon in possession, and assuming your arguments, what limits can Congress put on anyone with respect to future conduct if it's going to be a burden? Under your view, it stops people from traveling. Career criminal statutes put on the distinct disadvantage of a longer sentence. Does that argument that you just made go more to whether or not the BIA's conclusion that Congress intended to rescind the Fleuti decision -- but you assume that's what its intent was? So if we assume that, if we assume that was Congress's intent, doesn't that start give you the conclusion? If Congress tended to undo it, doesn't that prove that they intended to effective retroactively? No, no. Those go to the basic premise. If you assume Congress intended to rescind the prior doctrine, isn't that proof itself that it intended to apply the statute retroactively? To this conduct? But isn't that the case here, meaning -- it goes back to the Chief Justice's question, which is, what they're trying to do is punish those individuals, those LPRs who have committed this kind of crime, by not letting them travel or come back in. That's really what their argument is, is, you are imposing a punishment, a disability for having committed the crime. You're not imposing a disability merely for the act of traveling. Prior to the Fernandez case, the illegal act remained. And so that was within your control. But the -- you can't undo an illegal act that you've done to be able to travel. The act is now part of your background. And so there's nothing in your control to change that act once the statute has passed. So you're -- you're carrying that around as a disability.

2011,Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band v. Patchak,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Could you tell me who you think would have a valid and timely APA action to challenge what the Secretary has allegedly done here, which is to take lands into trust in violation of the statute per our -- I know that the U.S. is challenging that assumption, but let's assume the reality of the allegation. Who would -- who would be able to challenge it, and in what mechanism? That, I understand. That's why I said timely filed. Let's assume a situation where you first promise the land to one tribe, and then, in the midst of negotiations, another tribe lays claim. The United States says, I change my mind; I'm going to give the land to the other tribe. Does the tribe that you have denied the land to have any standing or any rights with respect to challenging that determination? I'm a little confused. Counsel-- --Counsel, you're assuming that the statute was passed against a backdrop of complete sovereign immunity; but, if you look at Larson and Malone, it appears as if prior to the enactment of the QTA people could bring suits to say that an officer had acted beyond his or her statutory authority. So what the Quiet Title Act did was encapsulate some of that law. From where do we draw the conclusion that the intent was to eliminate every other claim that could be brought under something like the APA or an officer suit? Would you have been entitled to file in that 30-day period? How is your claim, the one that you ultimately made, any different than what you would have done if you had filed within the 30 days? Same claim, right. All right. Tell me what relief you're seeking that's different than -- are you -- what relief are you seeking? Aren't you seeking to shed the United States of its title? Just the -- what's the -- don't tell me what your cause of action is. What relief at the end of the day do you want? Counsel, is there any limit to who can bring an APA action under your theory? It seems to me that what you're saying is that anyone other than a landowner because of the Quiet Title Act can within 6 years attempt to unravel any decision the government has made to take land, because we're not limited now to trust lands. We're limited -- under your theory, whenever the government takes any kind of land, anyone's entitled to come in and challenge that action under the APA for 6 years and to seek an injunction because it isn't a quiet title action. It's merely a challenge to the decision to take land. Is there any limit to your theory as to who can bring that kind of action and-- --In which way? You're saying anyone who is affected, your niece, your farm owner's niece who comes to visit twice a year or visits the land and walks through it, could presumably say: I'm negatively affected by the government's taking of this land, Indian or not, within the 6 years, and the government improperly took the land; undo it. No, but my question -- counsel, my question was different. Under your theory, you could bring this suit after the land has been taken. NEPA assumes before the land was taken. I'm talking about under your theory of law, once land has been taken by the U.S., if anyone has a viable legal claim that the land was taken improperly, whether it's Indian trust land or anyone else's land for any other purpose, that person within 6 years can still bring a suit under the APA. Government land is always taken by administrative action. Forget about the trust. Because under your theory of what -- what the APA permits you to do, anytime the government takes land, whether into trust or for any other purpose, the APA permits someone within six years, with whatever definition of prudential standing you want to give it, to come in after the taking and challenge that it was ultra vires, that it was done improperly. That's your theory. So going back to Justice Breyer's question, why isn't that within the quiet title action prohibition-- --once it's in the government's hands. Was that the -- I thought part of it was agricultural land, and that another part was a business. I mean, I think -- I thought -- well, the government can correct me. Right. Is that because you don't have a theory as to why once the government takes it it's not a quiet title action? So answer my question, or the one that Justice Breyer has said. Then it doesn't -- and the one Justice Kagan repeated yet again -- okay? What difference does it make that the government has taken title? Whether the government has title or doesn't, under your theory, since this is not a quiet action -- title action, anyone who is unhappy with the way the government took title could challenge it within 6 years. Isn't that the bottom line of your theory? Absent laches. You say the only defense is laches. But the bottom line is, under your theory, as long as no landowner, the person most directly affected by the taking, as long as that person can't sue, but anybody who is an indirect person can sue within 6 years, anybody who says, I don't want the land, I just don't want the U.S. to have the land. But they can't undo the transfer. They can only get money. ",could you tell me who you think would have a valid and timely apa action to challenge what the secretary have allegedly do here which be to take land into trust in violation of the statute per our i know that the us be challenge that assumption but let us assume the reality of the allegation who would who would be able to challenge it and in what mechanism that i understand that be why i say timely file let us assume a situation where you first promise the land to one tribe and then in the midst of negotiation another tribe lay claim the united state say i change my mind I be go to give the land to the other tribe do the tribe that you have deny the land to have any standing or any right with respect to challenge that determination I be a little confused counsel counsel you be assume that the statute be pass against a backdrop of complete sovereign immunity but if you look at larson and malone it appear as if prior to the enactment of the qta people could bring suit to say that an officer have act beyond his or her statutory authority so what the quiet title act do be encapsulate some of that law from where do we draw the conclusion that the intent be to eliminate every other claim that could be bring under something like the apa or an officer suit would you have be entitle to file in that day period how be your claim the one that you ultimately make any different than what you would have do if you have file within the day same claim right all right tell me what relief you be seek that be different than be you what relief be you seek be not you seek to she have the united state of its title just the what be the do not tell me what your because of action be what relief at the end of the day do you want counsel be there any limit to who can bring an apa action under your theory it seem to me that what you be say be that anyone other than a landowner because of the quiet title act can within year attempt to unravel any decision the government have make to take land because we be not limit now to trust land we be limited under your theory whenever the government take any kind of land anyone s entitle to come in and challenge that action under the apa for year and to seek an injunction because it be not a quiet title action it be merely a challenge to the decision to take land be there any limit to your theory as to who can bring that kind of action and in which way you be say anyone who be affect your niece your farm owner s niece who come to visit twice a year or visit the land and walk through it could presumably say I be negatively affect by the government s taking of this land indian or not within the year and the government improperly take the land undo it no but my question counsel my question be different under your theory you could bring this suit after the land have be take nepa assumes before the land be take I be talk about under your theory of law once land have be take by the us if anyone have a viable legal claim that the land be take improperly whether it be indian trust land or anyone else s land for any other purpose that person within year can still bring a suit under the apa government land be always take by administrative action forget about the trust because under your theory of what what the apa permit you to do anytime the government take land whether into trust or for any other purpose the apa permit someone within six year with whatever definition of prudential stand you want to give it to come in after the taking and challenge that it be ultra vires that it be do improperly that be your theory so go back to justice breyer s question why be not that within the quiet title action prohibition once it be in the government s hand be that the i think part of it be agricultural land and that another part be a business i mean i think i thought well the government can correct me right be that because you do not have a theory as to why once the government take it it be not a quiet title action so answer my question or the one that justice breyer have say then it do not and the one justice kagan repeat yet again okay what difference do it make that the government have take title whether the government have title or do not under your theory since this be not a quiet action title action anyone who be unhappy with the way the government take title could challenge it within year be not that the bottom line of your theory absent laches you say the only defense be laches but the bottom line be under your theory as long as no landowner the person most directly affect by the taking as long as that person can not sue but anybody who be an indirect person can sue within year anybody who say i do not want the land i just do not want the us to have the land but they can not undo the transfer they can only get money ,381.15,Roberts Court,"Apr 24, 2012",Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians,David Patchak,11-246,"Dec 12, 2011","Jun 18, 2012",113.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1

2011,Perry v. Perez,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Clement, section 5 says you can't draw new maps unless they have been precleared. You can't put them into effect. So the only thing that exists is old maps until you get the preclearance. I don't see how we can give deference to an enacted new map, if section 5 says don't give it effect until its been precleared. But you are asking for more than for guidance. You are asking for deference. You are saying they have to start with the new map even though that map hasn't been approved. Instead of starting, as the court below did, with the old map which had been approved. Doesn't that turn section 5 on its head? What district is that? What district is that? But what's was the problem? I'm sorry. That's incomplete. Counsel, I'm not sure how I understand that, okay? As I looked at one of the El Paso maps, the enacted map created a antler-type district, a head and two unconnected antlers on top, nothing tying them together. The district court went back to the benchmark and said: This is the benchmark district, now I'm going to draw the districts around it that fall naturally, trying to stay within neutral principles of not dividing up the city more than I have to, and it came out with another district. I don't understand what principle, what legal principle, the district court was violating that makes what it did with that particular county wrong. You're saying they should have given deference to an oddly-shaped district that changed a prior benchmark that's been challenged as having been created specifically to minimize the Latino vote. All of the challenges that relate to El Paso are very significant. The district court has already denied summary judgment on that. Tell me what legal principle they violated, other than the deference principle that you're relying upon? That's your-- Then you are saying the Court should look at the merits. No. Let's, let's go to something Justice Scalia asked was, what does a court do with frivolous claims? Does it assume under your theory that those frivolous claims are valid? And if you say no, it shouldn't assume that, then what level of inquiry should the Court engage in before it accepts or deviates from the enacted plan? So the Texas court cannot -- should automatically accept all -- that every district that a challenge has been raised in the DC Circuit Court is okay? Mr. Garza, what's the real drop-dead date?

2011,Judulang v. Holder,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"But you're not -- you're not-- --I go back to Justice Breyer's question. What you just said made logical sense; the category of gun possession doesn't go in. Visa fraud doesn't become a crime of moral turpitude. But we have cases that have said generically, manslaughter which involves violence is a crime of moral turpitude. Others have qualified sexual abuse of a minor. I don't know of anyone who would think that that category of crimes, whether you call it indecency, touching or -- we've already said touching alone may not qualify -- but my point is, you now are saying, I think, and correct me if I'm wrong, that aggravated violent felons is an entire category, and anything that falls under that label can't be a grounds of exclusion. That's how I read your categorical comparison, though. So now why is manslaughter not a crime of moral turpitude? Well, I keep going back to my question. There's only one category now, aggravated violent felony. That's the only category you are looking at. It doesn't matter, in your judgment. That -- that is your test. If it qualifies as an aggravated violent felony, it cannot be a crime of moral turpitude. Let's go back to a concrete example following Justice Ginsburg's example. Someone is charged with a crime of violence, voluntary manslaughter. And would an officer at the airport say you're not admittable; that's a crime involving moral turpitude? Could the officer say that? And could he then waive that ground under 212(c)? Now let's assume that he did, that he waives that crime of moral turpitude. Would the government now put that individual in deportation and say this voluntary manslaughter doesn't meet the statutory counterpart test. So for that very crime, we are going to deport you, even though we let you in, because it's a crime involving violence. Would you? Can you? Is that where your test leads you? Could I ask just a practical question? Does this issue go away finally when there are no more St. Cyr people? Meaning is there -- there is no 212(c) anymore. Exactly. And so really the issue that we have at the moment is whether your decision to effect what has happened now in the past, to do what Congress has done moving forward, and to avoid St. Cyr, is just to say, if it's an aggravated crime of violence it just doesn't qualify anymore. That's what you are doing. You're not giving 212(c) to anybody anymore? But you were just saying if they are aggravated -- if they've committed an aggravated crime of violence they are not getting it anymore. But this whole thing goes away once all the St. Cyr people have-- If they weren't law-abiding, they would have committed a new felony that would render them inadmissible-- ",but you be not you be not i go back to justice breyer s question what you just say make logical sense the category of gun possession do not go in visa fraud do not become a crime of moral turpitude but we have case that have say generically manslaughter which involve violence be a crime of moral turpitude others have qualify sexual abuse of a minor i do not know of anyone who would think that that category of crime whether you call it indecency touch or we have already say touch alone may not qualify but my point be you now be say i think and correct me if I be wrong that aggravate violent felon be an entire category and anything that fall under that label can not be a ground of exclusion that be how i read your categorical comparison though so now why be manslaughter not a crime of moral turpitude well i keep go back to my question there be only one category now aggravate violent felony that be the only category you be look at it do not matter in your judgment that that be your test if it qualify as an aggravated violent felony it can not be a crime of moral turpitude let us go back to a concrete example follow justice ginsburg s example someone be charge with a crime of violence voluntary manslaughter and would an officer at the airport say you be not admittable that be a crime involve moral turpitude could the officer say that and could he then waive that ground under c now let us assume that he do that he waive that crime of moral turpitude would the government now put that individual in deportation and say this voluntary manslaughter do not meet the statutory counterpart test so for that very crime we be go to deport you even though we let you in because it be a crime involve violence would you can you be that where your test lead you could i ask just a practical question do this issue go away finally when there be no more st cyr people meaning be there there be no c anymore exactly and so really the issue that we have at the moment be whether your decision to effect what have happen now in the past to do what congress have do move forward and to avoid st cyr be just to say if it be an aggravated crime of violence it just do not qualify anymore that be what you be do you be not give c to anybody anymore but you we be just say if they be aggravate if they have commit an aggravated crime of violence they be not get it anymore but this whole thing go away once all the st cyr people have if they be not law abide they would have commit a new felony that would render them inadmissible ,204.53,Roberts Court,"Oct 12, 2011",Joel Judulang,"Eric H.

I thought the earlier, the November 15th letter agreement-- --always left it up to the judge whether to accept either the felony with shock treatment or misdemeanor with 90 days. So the judge was always free to reject either of those two? Binding the judge? He would have had to accept it. But he would not have had to accept the 90 days. I'm sorry.

2011,"Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Ltd. v. Novo Nordisk A/S",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel-- --Counsel-- --Counsel-- --I'm sorry. Finish answering. I will wait for your rebuttal. But you said that-- --Except, counsel-- --Except the FDA tells parties not to rely on the orange code. It tells them what controls is the patent. Could I ask you-- --just on a practical basis. I understand that the Petitioner has filed an amended label in 2010. I presume that that amended label copies the current label with the exception of substituting the manufacturer. But let's assume that's-- --Now, it claims that when the paragraph IV -- the paragraph IV action is started and it's sued for infringement, that it's automatically going to lose-- --because-- --Could you explain to me -- could you explain to me why? Is merely the use of a label that's identical infringement or is it an infringement of the underlying patent? Okay. So tell us how a court gets out of the quandary of there being a claim that is stipulated to -- I've infringed -- and then how does it deal with the counterclaim? Now, the district court just ignored the act of infringement below and went straight to the counterclaim. But I'm not quite sure how you get out of the quandary that this creates for the courts and the parties. Let's assume that Caraco puts in a label like the one it wants to use under claim 4. Will the FDA just kick it out? It will not even ask for a response from Novo? But is that before -- without an infringement action by Novo? If you tell me the FDA doesn't want to get involved in construing the patent, why is it kicking out the claim for, claim for, claim until Novo does a suit on whether or not the generic is infringing or not-- --and let that issue be decided below? What odds would you put-- --What odds would you put as a betting lawyer on them winning a challenge to the FDA policy decisions of what its capable of doing and not doing? Counsel, let's assume, because I now take from your earlier conversation with Justice Breyer that you're saying the use code here is absolutely right, because the only use that we claimed was the combination use of the drug, your drug with the metformin. But the only thing that is wrong here is the indication that the FDA has required. So that's not even wrong because you have no choice about that; is that correct. What this means practically I believe is that when your patent expires no generic can come in with a use that's different than yours because they're going to be boxed out by this indication, this overbroad indication. Do you actually I thought think that that's what Congress intended? I thought with claim 4 and section viii that what Congress intended was to ensure that drugs got onto the market as quickly as possible. What is the parade of horribles that you imagine if we were to read the counterclaim provision in the way your adversary is promoting and the government is promoting? What -- what, presumably in the normal case and the one that the regulations appear to expect is that the use code, the indication code, everything is going to match the patent. So in that situation, the counterclaim would have no work to do. So what is the parade of horribles? I -- I'm asking you to accept that we are to -- as an assumption only, don't -- it's not intended to be a -- a ruling -- to assume that we read the counterclaim in the way your adversaries want us to. What's the parade of horribles? Going back to the question that I had. And a more practical question-- --As I read the record, in April of '08, the <FDA> [= FDA] rejected your section viii application. All right? And it asked you to submit an amended code. Your brief says we did it in September, Is it anywhere in the record? Did you -- you submitted what the FDA requested for your claim 4, the amended label?

2011,Armour v. City of Indianapolis,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, I understand your arguments. Your adversary raises a point that concerns me, which is what happens to all other amnesty programs like parking ticket amnesties? And if you take your logic to an extreme, how about something that doesn't involve money but immigration status amnesty, illegal aliens who can apply for citizenship and be forgiven their illegal entry? Doesn't the logic of your theory basically mean that there are no circumstances in which the government could treat people differently? Every time a police officer stops me for a traffic violation, I get angry when he lets somebody else go. So you are suggesting that there is a difference between that and this case where the government is basically saying, you owe me something and I'm going to forgive you what you owe me? You see, the problem that I have is that you're trying to lop off half of the project, which is was what was the Barrett project -- without looking at what the new project is. And that goes to what Justice Breyer's point was. Moving forward, every old project and every new project is going to pay more money than they did under the Barrett Law, because I think, if I understand correctly, the city is raising a -- essentially not a flat fee, but a fee -- assessing a flat fee across all taxpayers so that these sewer lines can be built. Am I correct about that? But it -- but it says that new people are going to pay a flat fee. Old people are going to pay $10 more a month that they didn't have to pay. And so why can't they come in, and why don't they come in and say exactly what Justice Breyer said: You forgave the payments of taxes for hooking up to the sewer system of these new people coming in. You're treating me differently. Well, so everybody else says I want to pay $2,500. You're still not dealing with the fact that this was one decision tied to others. It was a package deal. And so that the rationality of this package deal has to be seen in context. You want to lop it off and say, all I'm looking at is how much these taxpayers paid for this old system, not what the new system is creating. That is the park -- parking amnesty example that you have said wasn't the same. Because if an individual taxpayer has filed late, it's like the parking guy who didn't file his ticket, either. So you really are saying that amnesty programs are out of the question if the risk is imposed equally on everyone. No, but you are saying if you forgive the parking ticket, that's an equal protection violation. Was his figure of $2 million accurate? The stakes in the other case. ",counsel i understand your argument your adversary raise a point that concern me which be what happen to all other amnesty program like park ticket amnesty and if you take your logic to an extreme how about something that do not involve money but immigration status amnesty illegal alien who can apply for citizenship and be forgive their illegal entry do not the logic of your theory basically mean that there be no circumstance in which the government could treat people differently every time a police officer stop me for a traffic violation i get angry when he let us somebody else go so you be suggest that there be a difference between that and this case where the government be basically say you owe me something and I be go to forgive you what you owe me you see the problem that i have be that you be try to lop off half of the project which be be what be the barrett project without look at what the new project be and that go to what justice breyer s point be move forward every old project and every new project be go to pay more money than they do under the barrett law because i think if i understand correctly the city be raise a essentially not a flat fee but a fee assess a flat fee across all taxpayer so that these sewer line can be build be i correct about that but it but it say that new people be go to pay a flat fee old people be go to pay more a month that they do not have to pay and so why can not they come in and why do not they come in and say exactly what justice breyer say you forgive the payment of tax for hook up to the sewer system of these new people come in you be treat me differently well so everybody else say i want to pay you be still not deal with the fact that this be one decision tie to others it be a package deal and so that the rationality of this package deal have to be see in context you want to lop it off and say all I be look at be how much these taxpayer pay for this old system not what the new system be create that be the park park amnesty example that you have say be not the same because if an individual taxpayer have file late it be like the parking guy who do not file his ticket either so you really be say that amnesty program be out of the question if the risk be impose equally on everyone no but you be say if you forgive the parking ticket that be an equal protection violation be his figure of million accurate the stake in the other case ,195.24,Roberts Court,"Feb 29, 2012",Christine Armour,City of Indianapolis,11-161,"Nov 14, 2011","Jun 4, 2012",113.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2011,Hall v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, how do you deal with section 346? I read 346(b) to say that, unless the estate is a separate tax entity under the code, that the debtor, not the estate, pays State and local taxes. This is totally contrary to what you're saying, but the language of 346(b) basically answers the question against you with respect to State and local taxes. So the debtor is going to pay, and so when this-- --says -- whenever the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 provides that no separate taxable estate shall be created in a case concerning a debtor under this title-- --Chapter 12 doesn't create a separate taxable estate. And that the income, et cetera, shall be taxed to or claimed by the debtor under State or local law. This -- this is hard for me to understand, given the last line. ""The estate shall be liable for any tax imposed on such corporation or partnership, but not for any tax imposed on partners or members. "" By the logic of that last sentence, it seems to me that the preceding section is not looking to the estate, but to the debtor, to pay the taxes. So why -- why would the last sentence be necessary? I'm going to ask the government this, but are you aware of any circuit split or any cases below that have accepted the government's arguments that Chapter 12 involves prepetition debts only and that don't pay administrative expenses postbankruptcy? That's a different question. The government's now saying that Chapter 12 involves only prepetition claims. And it's basically by that argument saying it doesn't involve and can't involve administrative expenses. their argument. And so I'm asking is -- That's how I read are there any courts that you are aware of below who have been presented with this argument outside of the tax situation who have accepted it? Who have failed to give priority to administrative expenses? I'm not asking you to defend their position. It's just such a broad position that I'm trying to understand if there is a split out there that we are unaware of. So can we go back to the issue that gives me trouble? How to read ""incurred by the estate"". If the estate doesn't pay taxes-- --how could it be incurred by the estate when Congress, if it intended what you're saying it intended, could have said ""incurred during bankruptcy""? Could you turn back to -- before you answer my other question, could you finish your thought about what you are doing with wages? Are they given priority or aren't they? If you are saying they are not, if we accept your reading of this employee wage taxes are not administrative expenses. Counsel, before you finish, could you answer my question of what impact your broader reading -- your Chapter 12 affects only prepetition debts -- what else is that kind of holding going to affect? Your narrow alternative holding affects just this issue. That broader reading -- I worry about a broader reading when I don't know its impact. Yes? The problem with that argument is that the two are used interchangeably by everyone. Congress, the Court-- --The government in many situations, given the broad definition of ""claims"", the only logical conclusion is that it includes a subset, a liability created by administrative expenses. ",counsel how do you deal with section i read b to say that unless the estate be a separate tax entity under the code that the debtor not the estate pay state and local tax this be totally contrary to what you be say but the language of b basically answer the question against you with respect to state and local tax so the debtor be go to pay and so when this say whenever the internal revenue code of provide that no separate taxable estate shall be create in a case concern a debtor under this title chapter do not create a separate taxable estate and that the income et cetera shall be tax to or claim by the debtor under state or local law this this be hard for me to understand give the last line the estate shall be liable for any tax impose on such corporation or partnership but not for any tax impose on partner or members by the logic of that last sentence it seem to me that the precede section be not look to the estate but to the debtor to pay the tax so why why would the last sentence be necessary I be go to ask the government this but be you aware of any circuit split or any case below that have accept the government s argument that chapter involve prepetition debt only and that do not pay administrative expense postbankruptcy that be a different question the government s now say that chapter involve only prepetition claim and it be basically by that argument say it do not involve and can not involve administrative expense their argument and so I be ask be that be how i read be there any court that you be aware of below who have be present with this argument outside of the tax situation who have accept it who have fail to give priority to administrative expense I be not ask you to defend their position it be just such a broad position that I be try to understand if there be a split out there that we be unaware of so can we go back to the issue that give me trouble how to read incur by the estate if the estate do not pay tax how could it be incur by the estate when congress if it intend what you be say it intend could have say incur during bankruptcy could you turn back to before you answer my other question could you finish your thought about what you be do with wage be they give priority or be not they if you be say they be not if we accept your reading of this employee wage tax be not administrative expense counsel before you finish could you answer my question of what impact your broad read your chapter affect only prepetition debt what else be that kind of hold go to affect your narrow alternative hold affect just this issue that broad reading i worry about a broad reading when i do not know its impact yes the problem with that argument be that the two be use interchangeably by everyone congress the court the government in many situation give the broad definition of claim the only logical conclusion be that it include a subset a liability create by administrative expense ,222.47000000000008,Roberts Court,"Nov 29, 2011","Lynwood D.

2011,Rehberg v. Paulk,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Pincus, you in answer to one of Justice Kagan's questions, you noted that you really can't find a case where a court relied exclusively on the grand jury testimony. In most of the cases that I've reviewed, there's a discussion that both non-grand jury and grand jury testimony was being relied upon; is that accurate? Could you tell me what -- the United States as amica is supporting a vacatur and remand on the ground that there might be adequate independent evidence from the grand jury testimony in this case to sustain a cause of action. Do you agree with their recommendation? And if you don't agree, assume that we were to adopt the United States' position. What would be the independent evidence that you have that would support a malicious prosecution claim? Now, the court below took that into account and said: You are only relying on the grand jury testimony to prove the conspiracy and that's not enough. I don't know what an independent cause of action could be, because it is the grand jury proceeding that initiates the action. So, why would the common law permit it unless it recognized that a complaining witness has to do something to get the grand jury up and running, and go in and testify to something false to be liable for malicious prosecution. But the point I'm making is, I don't see how your position differs from the government's at all, and I'm not sure what -- how you could have independent guilt proven that requires anything more than proof, than the proof they proffered below, which was that this police officer issued subpoenas and took other steps to start the grand jury's process. And then you use their testimony at the grand jury to figure out whether it was fault or not. So explain to me again -- over here, Mr. Jones. Explain to me again why the act of sitting down with the prosecutor in his office and telling him a falsehood that leads the prosecutor to convene the grand jury and call you as a witness, why that act of meeting with the prosecutor and stating the false statement is not actionable independently? Or is it your position that that would be? No, no, no, no. He sat down, told the prosecutor exactly what he was later going to say in the grand jury. I rarely called a witness to a grand jury when I was a prosecutor who I hadn't spoken to before. Occasionally I had to because of circumstances, but the vast majority you sit down and talk to and find out what their story is. Identical story before and after during the grand jury. Is the story before an independent act sufficient to bring a malicious prosecution claim? You have a time sheet that shows that the prosecutor met with-- --the investigator? You have a time sheet. You mean, you need a witness to say they met together? You need someone to say that they talked before the grand jury? Assuming you have that much evidence, you think that's enough? Yes, exactly. Is that what you are requiring?

Your theory is so long as the -- that all -- that what is being monitored is the movement of person, of a person, they have no reasonable expectation that their possessions will not be used by you.

2011,Martel v. Clair,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I'm sorry. Can you remind me of what the outcome of that testing was? Counsel, as I read your briefs, I think you're making, perhaps, two different arguments. And I want to focus you in on which one you are really concentrating on. Which is, this presentation seems to be that, regardless of what standard we apply to the court of appeals review of what the district court did in denying the motion to substitute counsel, that it was wrong. And I presume that means it was wrong for the standard you are proposing and it was wrong for the interest of justice standard, am I correct? All right. As I read the Ninth Circuit's decision, assuming an interest of justice standard because that's the one they invoked, they said what happened here is that the district court didn't hold a hearing to determine itself exactly what the dispute was about, and so it was a process failure, basically is what they're saying. Now, you make assumptions based on matters that have come up since that hearing about what the dispute was about and -- but I still don't know what the Federal defender's position was as to whether or not communications had broken down with the client to a point where they thought, as they did on appeal, that they couldn't continue. So, tell me why, assuming we accept that an interest of justice standard applies, the circuit court has no power or applied it improperly by saying -- forget about the remedy -- has no power to say, district court judges, you have to at a minimum inquire and set forth your reasons based on the facts of that inquiry. But what does that have to do with ""I think they are doing a good? "" ""I mean, it -- it could well be that the judge later decides, after he hears from the Federal defender, I don't think that -- we don't think there is anything to be done, he disagrees. "" ""But he really never got an explanation from the Federal defenders. "" He never got an explanation from the Federal defenders. You are familiar with 3599(e), aren't you? Which requires counsel to participate in subsequent proceedings. Of a certain type and limited. Is it your position that if there is a complete breakdown of communications with an attorney, post habeas decision, that that is inadequate in the interest of justice or otherwise for a court to say, that could implicate proceedings after 3599, so I should substitute now? Oh, but you are presuming you are going to win. You are presuming you are going to win. I think 3599 applies to situations in which the habeas petitioner wins a remand or otherwise has something that's going to follow the habeas decision. So this is sort of a made-up standard. Can you point to one case in which this standard has been used by any district court or court of appeals? Can you point to any inquiry by Congress in which such a test was discussed, considered in any way? Well, so what you're suggesting is in noncapital cases, which are less serious, you are going to have a higher bar for a right that the statute gives a judge without any limitation. The capital limitation is that the judge on its own motion or a motion by defendant can substitute. So how about a standard that the courts are used to and one that has a basis in Congress's choice, like interest of justice? Counsel, could I give you an example? Beginning of the litigation, all right? Capital counsel is appointed. Capital counsel wants to raise challenges to the conviction and sentence, and defendant says: I don't -- I want to die. Is the district court entitled to substitute that counsel under your theory? Because you said to me it has to be counsel that's -- that counsel that has abandoned the client. Counsel doesn't want to abandon the client, counsel wants to prosecute the case. There is no conflict of interest. Counsel's not representing anybody else. And what was your third criteria? Well, this is Seth Waxman, sitting right next to you. I suspect that's the case. So beginning of the case, first decision, and defendant comes in and says: Substitute my attorney. What would be your argument under your test? So there are some decisions that the client controls? But that's not abandonment. That's an error. That's a problem. But it's not abandonment under your definition. Well, if I tell my attorney, follow these leads, that's a failure of an agent as well. Given my example, isn't it the case that under the interest of justice standard there will be situations in which a substitution like the one I just posited would be right, that wouldn't be right under your standard? Are you suggesting that for noncapital defendants Congress chose to give them more rather than less? But you are saying capital have lesser rights. Isn't delay one of the factors that courts routinely look at under the interest of justice standard? So we go back to Justice Breyer's point that, even under the interest of justice standard, you are claiming there was an error? Mister-- --It has to go with the scope of the remedy that they did. Assuming, as I do and you just said, that what the Ninth Circuit said is there is -- he should have gotten a reason, an explanation, but now there is a new attorney anyway, so what do we do, isn't the normal thing to do just to remand it, to let the district court decide what steps it wants to take, including to decide whether or not it would have granted the motion for substitution if it had heard the explanation? Meaning, there was a new judge. But, that doesn't -- a new judge is never stopped from considering what has happened in the case. And to decide whether under the facts as they existed at the time. But it's not academic. It wasn't academic for the judge below, the new judge-- --to say, what happened back then; I don't believe the motion was timely; I don't believe that you were foreclosed from doing other things; motion to substitute would have been denied; end of case. Can you tell us whether that testing has been done or not? I'm sorry, no, you don't think it has been? In the appendix. I'm sorry. Then your answer is yes, Mr. Goh's prints don't match the prints found in the file. That doesn't worry your prosecutor's office? If the fingerprints that were found at the scene of this crime matched Goh, that wouldn't give you pause? I'm sorry, what? So why hasn't the test been done? ",I be sorry can you remind me of what the outcome of that test be counsel as i read your brief i think you be make perhaps two different argument and i want to focus you in on which one you be really concentrate on which be this presentation seem to be that regardless of what standard we apply to the court of appeal review of what the district court do in deny the motion to substitute counsel that it be wrong and i presume that mean it be wrong for the standard you be propose and it be wrong for the interest of justice standard be i correct all right as i read the ninth circuit s decision assume an interest of justice standard because that be the one they invoke they say what happen here be that the district court do not hold a hearing to determine itself exactly what the dispute be about and so it be a process failure basically be what they be say now you make assumption base on matter that have come up since that hear about what the dispute be about and but i still do not know what the federal defender s position be as to whether or not communication have break down with the client to a point where they think as they do on appeal that they could not continue so tell me why assume we accept that an interest of justice standard applies the circuit court have no power or apply it improperly by say forget about the remedy have no power to say district court judge you have to at a minimum inquire and set forth your reason base on the fact of that inquiry but what do that have to do with i think they be do a good i mean it it could well be that the judge later decides after he hear from the federal defender i do not think that we do not think there be anything to be do he disagrees but he really never get an explanation from the federal defenders he never get an explanation from the federal defender you be familiar with e be not you which require counsel to participate in subsequent proceeding of a certain type and limited be it your position that if there be a complete breakdown of communication with an attorney post habeas decision that that be inadequate in the interest of justice or otherwise for a court to say that could implicate proceeding after so i should substitute now oh but you be presume you be go to win you be presume you be go to win i think applies to situation in which the habeas petitioner win a remand or otherwise have something that be go to follow the habeas decision so this be sort of a make up standard can you point to one case in which this standard have be use by any district court or court of appeal can you point to any inquiry by congress in which such a test be discuss consider in any way well so what you be suggest be in noncapital case which be less serious you be go to have a high bar for a right that the statute give a judge without any limitation the capital limitation be that the judge on its own motion or a motion by defendant can substitute so how about a standard that the court be use to and one that have a basis in congress s choice like interest of justice counsel could i give you an example beginning of the litigation all right capital counsel be appoint capital counsel want to raise challenge to the conviction and sentence and defendant say i do not i want to die be the district court entitle to substitute that counsel under your theory because you say to me it have to be counsel that be that counsel that have abandon the client counsel do not want to abandon the client counsel want to prosecute the case there be no conflict of interest counsel s not represent anybody else and what be your third criterion well this be seth waxman sit right next to you i suspect that be the case so begin of the case first decision and defendant come in and say substitute my attorney what would be your argument under your test so there be some decision that the client control but that be not abandonment that be an error that be a problem but it be not abandonment under your definition well if i tell my attorney follow these lead that be a failure of an agent as well give my example be not it the case that under the interest of justice standard there will be situation in which a substitution like the one i just posit would be right that would not be right under your standard be you suggest that for noncapital defendant congress choose to give them more rather than less but you be say capital have less right be not delay one of the factor that court routinely look at under the interest of justice standard so we go back to justice breyer s point that even under the interest of justice standard you be claim there be an error mister it have to go with the scope of the remedy that they do assume as i do and you just say that what the ninth circuit say be there be he should have get a reason an explanation but now there be a new attorney anyway so what do we do be not the normal thing to do just to remand it to let the district court decide what step it want to take include to decide whether or not it would have grant the motion for substitution if it have hear the explanation meaning there be a new judge but that do not a new judge be never stop from consider what have happen in the case and to decide whether under the fact as they exist at the time but it be not academic it be not academic for the judge below the new judge to say what happen back then i do not believe the motion be timely i do not believe that you we be foreclose from do other thing motion to substitute would have be deny end of case can you tell us whether that testing have be do or not I be sorry no you do not think it have be in the appendix I be sorry then your answer be yes mr goh s print do not match the print find in the file that do not worry your prosecutor s office if the fingerprint that we be find at the scene of this crime match goh that would not give you pause I be sorry what so why have not the test be do ,468.59,Roberts Court,"Dec 6, 2011","Michael

It -- it actually is much narrower than that. It's within a range, two ranges actually. And so it has already changed one range, and that's not the subject of the district court's finding that the lower number it's proposing is infringing. So it's not as broad as you are stating. Well, it took that position, but the district court narrowed it to 15 percent, to 15-- --It can offer the test. It can offer the test. It just can't recommend the dosage to the doctor. Tests do two things: they measure something-- --And therapeutic range does something else. The tests can happen. The doctor gets a number. What the doctor does with that number is a different issue. I -- I don't know what -- you keep saying you have to limit the product. But you told me that there is a different range for the treatment of skin diseases. So presumably there are different ranges for treatment of other diseases. So this patent has not limited exploration in there. You are claiming it has. That's an issue that your adversary can speak to. I think they say no in their briefs. But the point is, there's still a limit to their range. You are claiming at one point they said it was limitless, but if we disagree with that-- --how do you answer Justice Breyer's question? Mr. Shapiro-- --So we -- so do we add up all of the diseases in the world, all the potential diseases, and pick a percentage that this covers within that range? I think Justice Breyer is asking you for something that doesn't involve that. That involves some greater answer to the issue of limitation. How many patents of this type are out there? So that's novel. What's your answer about why this is novel? I guess my problem is, if we call this just simply a application of natural phenomenon or of a natural process, why are treatment patents at all-- --permissible, meaning if someone finds out that at level 300, it's bad, and tells doctors to stop, that's natural, too.

2011,Pacific Operators Offshore v. Valladolid,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"But Mr.-- --Sorry. How does that -- how does that provide you situs on the adjacent waters. I see, so you are saying you don't even -- you're not going-- --How do you get to the water above the shelf? Instead of saying they are part of the shelf? I think the issue that Justice Kennedy was alluding to was the example the Ninth Circuit used: A pitcher on the mound throws a baseball and hits the batter. The situs is not the mound, but the injury has occurred as a result of pitching, and so he's coming up with examples and I think that's what the Ninth Circuit was saying when it was creating the test of the substantial nexus between the operation and the injury. And that's the part of your -- of your definition that gives no credence to that possibility. You may be arguing that as a factual matter what this man was doing on land was not a substantial nexus. That's a different issue than providing a test that limits injury to an operation solely on the shelf. Well, you're not -- you don't want a but-for test. All right. You don't want a proximate cause test. Does this meet your definition of causation now? This is a new version of proximate cause. So substantial nexus is just right? Do you accept your adversary's position that whatever causal -- you have to, given your status test. Where are you drawing your status test from? Meaning, obviously it's not from the language. You're not -- I would have just thought you would have taken it out of (b) subdivision (2), the term ""employer"", almost the obverse, means an employer -- means an employer any of whose employees are employed in such operations.

2011,Williams v. Illinois,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, it hasn't been the focus of the briefing, but you've just made it the focus here. I know that you have been claiming that her statements about what constituted the Cellmark lab results are a statement that violates the Confrontation Clause. But are you taking the position that her statements and the admission of the documents, mailing the lab sample to the laboratory and them getting it back, that all of those business records were improperly admitted? Because she testified that in her records she sees that her lab -- and she says -- I think those records were produced, I could be wrong -- that-- --They were produced and admitted into evidence. That the lab sample taken from the victim, L.J., was mailed to the laboratory, and that it came back. Are you taking the position that those shipping documents were not business records? Are you taking the position that those were improperly admitted? Counsel, on your theory of this case, I think you say first it's not a statement; and second that if it is it was not offered for the truth. Under your theory, if this lab technician had introduced Cellmark's report, that would have been okay, because it wasn't offered for the truth. I'm changing the facts. Under your theory, she could have introduced the lab report? I don't understand the difference. Meaning the fact that you didn't physically introduce the report makes a difference? She testified that she reviewed lab samples. That matched the defendant. So what's the difference between that and saying; I have the report in my hand; and I match that report with the Williams report, and this is my conclusion. No. She said that: Cellmark said this is L.J.'s vaginal swab DNA. So she said that. So what's the difference between this and Justice Kennedy's question about Bullcoming? Could the expert in Bullcoming have said, as one of the amici here said, that all they would have had to do in Bullcoming is to read or to give a report that gave the blood alcohol content, the.5 or.10 or whatever it was, and have an expert come in and say, that number shows he's drunk. Is that any different from this situation? No, no. The only part of his expertise is the report says point.10; I'm not offering it for the truth; I'm assuming that that's true; then he was legally drunk. He has done nothing. All the report did was give a number. And the supervisor comes in and says that number violates -- is legal drunkenness. How is that different from that? All right, but you're not telling me why that's not the same here because what this expert said is, the Cellmark report is from this victim so it's the same set of numbers as in Bullcoming. Now he's taking a step and saying, instead of legal drunkness, it matches someone else's that I took. But, Mr. Dreeben, she did repeat what Cellmark said. I asked your -- the State's attorney whether, if she had read the data report from the laboratory analysis, would that have been a violation of the Confrontation Clause? I'm not clear. She says, only if you admitted it. But in fact that's what she did. If you read her testimony -- I give you an example at page 79 -- she tells on cross-examination exactly what the steps were in the Cellmark report, what numbers they gave, and she tells and explains -- she -- the State's attorney took pride in this -- she said I disagree with that number that they came up with. I think the number should be -- so she's really reading the report. All right. So then let's -- all right. So let's get to-- --Could the State have done this? Mr. Dreeben, if no expert from either lab came in, if an expert had the Cellmark information and the Illinois State police information, not offered for the truth of the matter, and came in and said I match this and I match that, and it's the defendant -- could that have been done? Are you saying that we owe no deference to the Illinois Supreme Court's judgment on this evidentiary issue? And if so, no deference, tell me what proposition of law supports that or are you saying deference is due but we shouldn't give it. Which of the two positions do you take? I'm sorry, I'm going back to Justice Kennedy's question. There is an Illinois requirement that the trial judges give the instruction he described? ",counsel it have not be the focus of the briefing but you have just make it the focus here i know that you have be claim that her statement about what constitute the cellmark lab result be a statement that violate the confrontation clause but be you take the position that her statement and the admission of the document mail the lab sample to the laboratory and them get it back that all of those business record we be improperly admit because she testify that in her record she see that her lab and she say i think those record we be produce i could be wrong that they we be produce and admit into evidence that the lab sample take from the victim lj be mail to the laboratory and that it come back be you take the position that those ship document we be not business record be you take the position that those we be improperly admit counsel on your theory of this case i think you say first it be not a statement and second that if it be it be not offer for the truth under your theory if this lab technician have introduce cellmark s report that would have be okay because it be not offer for the truth I be change the fact under your theory she could have introduce the lab report i do not understand the difference mean the fact that you do not physically introduce the report make a difference she testify that she review lab sample that match the defendant so what be the difference between that and say i have the report in my hand and i match that report with the williams report and this be my conclusion no she say that cellmark say this be lj s vaginal swab dna so she say that so what be the difference between this and justice kennedy s question about bullcoming could the expert in bullcoming have say as one of the amici here say that all they would have have to do in bullcoming be to read or to give a report that give the blood alcohol content the or or whatever it be and have an expert come in and say that number show he be drunk be that any different from this situation no no the only part of his expertise be the report say point I be not offer it for the truth I be assume that that be true then he be legally drunk he have do nothing all the report do be give a number and the supervisor come in and say that number violates be legal drunkenness how be that different from that all right but you be not tell me why that be not the same here because what this expert say be the cellmark report be from this victim so it be the same set of number as in bullcoming now he be take a step and say instead of legal drunkness it match someone else s that i take but mr dreeben she do repeat what cellmark say i ask your the state s attorney whether if she have read the data report from the laboratory analysis would that have be a violation of the confrontation clause I be not clear she say only if you admit it but in fact that be what she do if you read her testimony i give you an example at page she tell on cross examination exactly what the step we be in the cellmark report what number they give and she tell and explain she the state s attorney take pride in this she say i disagree with that number that they come up with i think the number should be so she be really read the report all right so then let us all right so let us get to could the state have do this mr dreeben if no expert from either lab come in if an expert have the cellmark information and the illinois state police information not offer for the truth of the matter and come in and say i match this and i match that and it be the defendant could that have be do be you say that we owe no deference to the illinois supreme court s judgment on this evidentiary issue and if so no deference tell me what proposition of law support that or be you say deference be due but we should not give it which of the two position do you take I be sorry I be go back to justice kennedy s question there be an illinois requirement that the trial judge give the instruction he describe ,335.96,Roberts Court,"Dec 6, 2011",Sandy Williams,Illinois,10-8505,"Jun 28, 2011","Jun 18, 2012",113.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2011,United States v. Alvarez,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"General, may I pose a hypothetical? During the Vietnam War, a protester holds up a sign that says, ""I won a Purple Heart -- for killing babies. "" Knowing statement. He didn't win the Purple Heart. As a reader, I can't be sure whether he did and is a combat veteran who opposes the war, or whether he's a citizen protesting the war. Is that person, if he's not a veteran, having received the medal, is he liable under this act? Somewhat dangerous, isn't it, to subject speech to the absolute rule of no protection? Which is what you're advocating, I understand, that there are no circumstances in which this speech has value. I believe that's your bottom line. Harms -- General, I spent a lot of time going through the multiple cases that you cited in your brief defining the various statutes that basically impose penalties for impersonation of some sort or another. And virtually in every one of them, except perhaps one, there was either an economic interest that was harmed by the impersonation, either by the -- by the very face of the statute or by the nature of the claim, a dilution of a trademark, by taking on someone else's valuable property rights. And so I went back reading our cases, and Justice Story many, many years ago said, look, falsehoods have no value as such, but the ""breathing space"" concept is defined by those falsehoods which cause injury to rights that people possess, to -- to pecuniary interests that they have, or to the reputation of others. And almost every statute where we have approved a harm concept as being permissible for recovery has affected one of those three things. So please tell me what's wrong with Justice Story's view, number one; and, number two, how does the definition of harm fit in that? What's the harm here that fits within that descriptor. I didn't mention -- neither did Justice Story. He said if you want to regulate a falsehood, it has to cause a harm in this way. Not really. They are intended to protect the right of the government to secure truthful information. The government has a right to subpoena you at trial, subject you to oath, and force you to tell the truth. So if you -- that's a right. That fits within Story's definition. General, but I have a problem, which is it's not as narrow as it could get. Wouldn't take much to do exactly what Congress said it was doing, which was to protect against fraudulent claims of receiving a medal, and the example it used was someone who used a fraudulent claim of receiving a medal to get money. What I'm trying to get to is, what harm are we protecting here? I thought that the core of the First Amendment was to protect even against offensive speech. We have a legion of cases that said your emotional reaction to offensive speech is not enough. If that is the core of our First Amendment, what I hear, and that's what I think the court below said, is you can't really believe that a war veteran thinks less of the medal that he or she receives because someone's claiming fraudulently that they got one. They don't think less of the medal. We're reacting to the fact that we're offended by the thought that someone's claiming an honor they didn't receive. So outside of the emotional reaction, where's the harm? And I'm not minimizing it. I too take offense when people make these kinds of claims, but I take offense when someone I'm dating makes a claim that's not true. Or I'm not going to do this because the medal has been debased. But the reality here is that this gentleman was publicized, deriled for what he did. His public position was compromised, as is the case with almost everyone who's caught at lying. Counselor, it might-- --May I -- if I understood your argument, you're saying historically we have not protected false statements that cause harm. I think that's your argument. All right. Assuming -- so it's -- we do protect false statements presumptively, but the historical exceptions, like defamation, are those that cause harm. So I go back to Justice Alito's question, because you really haven't answered his question. You've dealt with the government process cases, although we could argue about whether that's protecting a process or protecting a government right to truthful information. That's a different issue. But the question is how do you deal with the intentional infliction of emotional distress? Because damage, we require injury, and it's defined under law what kind of injury. So tell me how you define harm in the nongovernmental situation, number one, and then tell me why that -- this situation doesn't fit that definition. So why isn't the outrage that medal winners, legitimately entitled medal winners, experience in seeing fake people, hearing fake people claim a medal, why isn't that comparable? Counsel, it seems to me that you're asking us to value the speech in context. We're not talking about the effect of the speech and whether you can regulate that. You're asking us to say, you know, the guy who says he's a college graduate in a political campaign, that could chill political speech. So in that lie in that context, you can't sanction. But you can sanction that lie in a different context. On a date. I don't know, because on a date, it doesn't chill political speech, and it will induce a young woman to date someone who she thinks is more of a professional, because that harms the parents, it harms the family. ",general may i pose a hypothetical during the vietnam war a protester hold up a sign that say i win a purple heart for kill babies know statement he do not win the purple heart as a reader i can not be sure whether he do and be a combat veteran who oppose the war or whether he be a citizen protest the war be that person if he be not a veteran have receive the medal be he liable under this act somewhat dangerous be not it to subject speech to the absolute rule of no protection which be what you be advocate i understand that there be no circumstance in which this speech have value i believe that be your bottom line harm general i spend a lot of time go through the multiple case that you cite in your brief define the various statute that basically impose penalty for impersonation of some sort or another and virtually in every one of them except perhaps one there be either an economic interest that be harm by the impersonation either by the by the very face of the statute or by the

such but the breathing space concept be define by those falsehood which because injury to right that people possess to to pecuniary interest that they have or to the reputation of others and almost every statute where we have approve a harm concept as be permissible for recovery have affect one of those three thing so please tell me what be wrong with justice story s view number one and number two how do the definition of harm fit in that what be the harm here that fit within that descriptor i do not mention neither do justice story he say if you want to regulate a falsehood it have to because a harm in this way not really they be intend to protect the right of the government to secure truthful information the government have a right to subpoena you at trial subject you to oath and force you to tell the truth so if you that be a right that fit within story s definition general but i have a problem which be it be not as narrow as it could get would not take much to do exactly what congress say it be do which be to protect against fraudulent claim of receive a medal and the example it use be someone who use a fraudulent claim of receive a medal to get money what I be try to get to be what harm be we protect here i think that the core of the first amendment be to protect even against offensive speech we have a legion of case that say your emotional reaction to offensive speech be not enough if that be the core of our first amendment what i hear and that be what i think the court below say be you can not really believe that a war veteran think less of the medal that he or she receive because someone s claim fraudulently that they get one they do not think less of the medal we be react to the fact that we be offend by the thought that someone s claim an honor they do not receive so outside of the emotional reaction where be the harm and I be not minimize it i too take offense when people make these kind of claim but i take offense when someone I be date make a claim that be not true or I be not go to do this because the medal have be debase but the reality here be that this gentleman be publicize deriled for what he do his public position be compromise as be the case with almost everyone who be catch at lie counselor it might may i if i understand your argument you be say historically we have not protect false statement that because harm i think that be your argument all right assume so it be we do protect false statement presumptively but the historical exception like defamation be those that because harm so i go back to justice alito s question because you really have not answer his question you have deal with the government process case although we could argue about whether that be protect a process or protect a government right to truthful

injury so tell me how you define harm in the nongovernmental situation number one and then tell me why that this situation do not fit that definition so why be not the outrage that medal winner

not talk about the effect of the speech and whether you can regulate that you be ask us to say you know the guy who say he be a college graduate in a political campaign that could chill political speech so in that lie in that context you can not sanction but you can sanction that lie in a different context on a date i do not know because on a date it do not chill political speech and it will

2011,PPL Montana v. Montana,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Could you define ""de minimis"" for me? If we can't, some guidance or limit that we set for-- --I know you've told me that you think Montello is not pertinent because it involved a different issue. But assuming that it were pertinent, because I'm not quite sure how its discussion doesn't fit the needs here, one of the factors you haven't mentioned in terms of de minimis is the portage and its use with respect to commerce; and by that I mean, it appears to me in Montello, what the Court was saying was the history of use of this river showed that these obstructions didn't stop the flow of commerce. That what people did was -- it appeared some extreme things. They got off -- they got their goods off one boat, walked it a certain distance or drove it by wagon another distance and then put it on another boat or the same boat that they had lessened the load on and moved it over. And so it doesn't talk about the distance of that portage; it talks about the impact on commerce. So why isn't that a factor in the de minimis issue? If there were a history here. There was a canal in there, wasn't there? But in The Montello, get they took the cargo off some boats-- --and moved it overland to another spot before they put it back on the boat. We can both look at the opinion, but I think there is one spot where the court says that in some areas they had to change boats. I don't disagree with you, but what I'm asking is, if we had a history of navigation of cargo that went to the beginning of one of these rivers, and I'm not a sailor so my terms -- the cargo is taken off and driven by wagon or some other mode to another spot and picked up again. Is that a different situation than one where that doesn't happen? That because this length of portage is so long that it is both economically and physically impossible to transport cargo in that way. Is that a different case for the question of navigability? 17 miles is very long. I think the Thompson is only 2.8 and that is really close to Montello where it talked about, about two miles for some portage areas. But I'm not a Midwesterner, and rivers of 200 miles are longer than-- So what's de minimis? Could 2.8 be de minimis in one situation and not, and how do we tell-- --If there's no falls but there are riparian waters that don't permit navigability over 2.8, than that's still navigable? I'm not sure-- --Am I to take that ""de minimis"" to you means small enough so that they get the boat physically over the portage, Whether they carry it, drag it? Go back to carrying their boat on their shoulders, which apparently in The Montello they did. What's the answer-- Under your theory, if there's a fall like this of 17 miles, and a train is 50 miles away and traverses that 17 miles, that portage is good enough. Outside of your fur traders and your gold miners, has that happened in any other situation -- your alleged gold miners and fur traders? Has that happened on -- on the -- in the Great Falls? Could you -- could you do me a favor and you tell me again -- I am having real trouble with the competing evidence in this case with respect to every one of the three areas in dispute and I have some serious questions about whether the court properly granted summary judgment. Your brief seems to suggest that I can't do -- we can't do anything about that because it wasn't a part of the question presented. Your adversary says that it's a fair question if we determine there is any legal approach -- error in legal approach of the court below. I'm assuming that also means on their weighing of evidentiary matters. So why shouldn't we address the summary judgment issue? Is there a mile stretch anywhere on this river. Yes. Is there a mile stretch in which the boats stop? Some water in the middle-- --I know the two at issue. But you're saying if we rule the way we do, we are going to slice it up and so does the Attorney -- the Solicitor General's office say, we are going to slice it up half mile or half acre by half acre. I am not sure how that happens. I go back to Justice Kennedy's question, which is does a boat stop mid stream? Counsel, was that the canal -- what subsequently became the canal area. I think that then the simplest rule is, is the river from shore to opposite shore -- any portion of it -- did boats traverse it. That would be I think what Justice Alito was asking. Portages that are de minimis. Point me -- I don't care where they are in the United States -- give me a list of some that are de minimis. ",could you define de minimis for me if we can not some guidance or limit that we set for i know you have tell me that you think montello be not pertinent because it involve a different issue but assume that it we be pertinent because I be not quite sure how its discussion do not fit the need here one of the factor you have not mention in term of de minimis be the portage and its use with respect to commerce and by that i mean it appear to me in montello what the court be say be the history of use of this river show that these obstruction do not stop the flow of commerce that what people do be it appear some extreme thing they get off they get their good off one boat walk it a certain distance or drive it by wagon another distance and then put it on another boat or the same boat that they have lessen the load on and move it over and so it do not talk about the distance of that portage it talk about the impact on commerce so why be not that a factor in the de minimis issue if there we be a history here there be a canal in there be not there but in the montello get they take the cargo off some boat and move it overland to another spot before they put it back on the boat we can both look at the opinion but i think there be one spot where the court say that in some area they have to change boat i do not disagree with you but what I be ask be if we have a history of navigation of cargo that go to the beginning of one of these river and I be not a sailor so my term the cargo be take off and drive by wagon or some other mode to another spot and pick up again be that a different situation than one where that do not happen that because this length of portage be so long that it be both economically and physically impossible to transport cargo in that way be that a different case for the question of navigability mile be very long i think the thompson be only and that be really close to montello where it talk about about two mile for some portage area but I be not a midwesterner and river of mile be long than so what be de minimis could be de minimis in one situation and not and how do we tell if there be no fall but there be riparian water that do not permit navigability over than that be still navigable I be not sure be i to take that de minimis to you mean small enough so that they get the boat physically over the portage whether they carry it drag it go back to carry their boat on their shoulder which apparently in the montello they do what be the answer under your theory if there be a fall like this of mile and a train be mile away and traverse that mile that portage be good enough outside of your fur trader and your gold miner have that happen in any other situation your alleged gold miner and fur trader have that happen on on the in the great fall could you could you do me a favor and you tell me again i be have real trouble with the compete evidence in this case with respect to every one of the three area in dispute and i have some serious question about whether the court properly grant summary judgment your brief seem to suggest that i can not do we can not do anything about that because it be not a part of the question present your adversary say that it be a fair question if we determine there be any legal approach error in legal approach of the court below I be assume that also mean on their weighing of evidentiary matter so why should not we address the summary judgment issue be there a mile stretch anywhere on this river yes be there a mile stretch in which the boat stop some water in the middle i know the two at issue but you be say if we rule the way we do we be go to slice it up and so do the attorney the solicitor general s office say we be go to slice it up half mile or half acre by half acre i be not sure how that happen i go back to justice kennedy s question which be do a boat stop mid stream counsel be that the canal what subsequently become the canal area i think that then the simple rule be be the river from shore to opposite shore any portion of it do boat traverse it that would be i think what justice alito be ask portage that be de minimis point me i do not care where they be in the united state give me a list of some that be de minimis ,336.9899999999999,Roberts Court,"Dec 7, 2011","PPL Montana, LLC",Montana,10-218,"Jun 20, 2011","Feb 22, 2012",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2011,Arizona v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Clement-- --could I interrupt, and turning to 2(B), could you tell me what the State's view is -- the Government proposes that it should be read on its face one way, and I think the State is arguing that there's a narrower way to read it. But am I to understand that under the State's position in this action, the only time that the inquiry about the status of an individual rises is after they've had probable cause to arrest that individual for some other crime? Can I -- can I-- --just stop you there just one moment? That's what I thought. So presumably, I think your argument is, that under any circumstance, a police officer would have the discretion to make that call. Seems to me that the issue is not about whether you make the call or not, although the Government is arguing that it might be, but on how long you detain the individual, meaning -- as I understand it, when individuals are arrested and held for other crimes, often there's an immigration check that most States do without this law. And to the extent that the government wants to remove that individual, they put in a warrant of detainer. This process is different. How is it different? No, I understand that's their argument. I can question them about that. But I want to get to how -- assuming your position, that doing it on a -- there's nothing wrong with doing it as it's been done in the past. Whenever anyone is detained, a call could be made. What I see as critical is the issue of how long, and under -- and when is the officer going to exercise discretion to release the person? What happens if -- this is the following call -- the call to the -- to the Federal Government. Yes, he's an illegal alien. No, we don't want to detain him. What does the law say, the Arizona law say, with respect to releasing that individual? I'm putting all of this outside of-- --I want to make sure that I get a clear representation from you. If on a call to the Federal agency, the agency says, we don't want to detain this alien, that alien will be released or -- unless it's under 6, is what you're telling me. Or under 6, 3, or some -- one other of Arizona's immigration clauses. All right. Then tell me-- --Counsel, could -- does section 6 permit an officer to arrest an individual who has overstayed a visitor's visa by a day? They are removable, correct? What is the definition of public offense? Counsel-- --Well, for those of us for whom legislative history has some importance, there seems to be quite a bit of legislative history that the -- that the idea of punishing employees was raised, discussed and explicitly rejected. The preemption language would be geared to what was decided to be punished. It seems odd to think that the Federal government is deciding on employment sanctions and has unconsciously decided not to punish employees. Can I ask you something? General, could you answer Justice Scalia's earlier question to your adversary? He asked whether it would be the Government's position that Arizona doesn't have the power to exclude or remove -- to exclude from its borders a person who's here illegally. General-- --I'm sorry. I'm a little confused. General, I'm terribly confused by your answer. Okay? And I don't know that you're focusing in on what I believe my colleagues are trying to get to. Making the -- 2(B) has two components, as I see it. Every person that's suspected of being an alien who's arrested for another crime -- that's what Mr. Clement says the statute means -- the officer has to pick up the phone and call -- and call the agency to find out if it's an illegal alien or not. He tells me that unless there's another reason to arrest the person -- and that's 3 and 6, or any of the other provisions -- but putting those aside, we're going to stay just in 2(B), if the government says, we don't want to detain the person, they have to be released for being simply an illegal alien, what's wrong with that? Taking out the other provisions, taking out any independent state-created basis of liability for being an illegal alien? Do you have the statistics as to how many arrests there are and how many -- and what the -- percentage of calls before the statute? Can I get to a different question? I think even I or someone else cut you off when you said there were three reasons why -- 2(B). Putting aside your argument that this -- that a systematic cooperation is wrong -- you can see it's not selling very well -- why don't you try to come up with something else? Because I, frankly -- as the chief has said to you, it's not that it's forcing you to change your enforcement priorities. You don't have to take the person into custody. So what's left of your argument? Please move-- --General, when -- when -- I know your brief, you had -- you said that there are some illegal aliens who have a right to remain here. And I'm just realizing that I don't really know what happens when the Arizona police call the Federal agency. They give the Federal agency a name, correct? You don't really have knowledge of what-- --All right. And what does the computer have? What information does your system have? Well, how does that database tell you that someone is illegal as opposed to a citizen? Today, if you use the names Sonya Sotomayor, they would probably figure out I was a citizen. But let's assume it's John Doe, who lives in Grand Rapids. So they are legal. Is there a citizen database? I'm sorry, there is or there isn't? So if you run out of your house without your driver's license or identification and you walk into a park that's closed and you're arrested, you -- they make the call to this agency. You could sit there forever while they-- --Figure out if you're-- You're inviting -- you're inviting the very sort of conflict that he's talking about. Because what's going to happen now is that if there is no statement by the Federal agency of legality, the person is arrested, and now we're going to have Federal resources spent on trying to figure out whether they have an asylum application, whether they have this, whether they have that, whether they are exempted under this reason, whether the failure to carry was accidental or not -- I mean, you are involving the Federal Government in your prosecution. Now, you may say we're not, because all we're going to show is -- what? That we got a Federal call -- we got a Federal answer that the person wasn't registered? No -- no Confrontation -- no Confrontation Clause problem with that? With relying on a call to a Federal agency and the police officer says, you're arrested, you're charged, it's not an illegal alien -- or it is an illegal alien. No, no, no. How about -- how about they get a response, yes, it's an illegal alien? So how -- where do they get the records that show that this person is an illegal alien that's not authorized to be here? Who do they get it from?

2011,Messerschmidt v. Millender,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, I thought in the Leon case that in fact, just like the claim in this case, that the affidavit was submitted to supervisors and the Court created the Leon test in spite of that. So to say that we have a case on point, Leon itself is on point. We created the test in the face supervisor's review. You are not actually, are you, arguing a Nuremberg defense now? That -- that simply because supervisors decide that it's okay, that that-- --exculpates someone from responsibility? All right. Then let's go to the other two ways that I think you are asking us to overrule our precedent. The first is using subjective information that a police officer knows, but hasn't disclosed in the warrant. I'm having a little bit of difficulty understanding how an entire warrant regime that presumes that the magistrate has all pertinent information, and that's why you would be let off the hook, how you can excuse a police officer when he doesn't place that information in front of the magistrate? Tell me how, this case, the bare-bone affidavit was sufficient? All it says is that this defendant is a member of a gang, but when the police officer is questioned, he is asked whether this crime at issue had any connection to his gang relationship and the answer was no. So how is the request of the warrant to search for all gang-related indicia anything more than the general warrant that our Founding Fathers in part passed the Fourth Amendment against? This is almost like-- --What do we do with the officer's testimony when he said, ""Did you have any reason to believe there were any more weapons in the house? "" He said, ""No"". What -- when an officer says that, why would then he think that he has complete license to go and ask for a warrant that's looking for more guns, when there is only evidence of him possessing one? So you are answering -- you are answering Justice Ginsburg by saying that any time a gang member commits any crime, the police are entitled to seek a warrant that permits the search for anything they have in their home that relates to their gang membership and to -- to guns? That did not involve -- by the officer's admission and your own, that wasn't gang-related. The assault-- --But wait a minute. That has nothing to do with the gang, unless you are saying that you had proof that the gang did something illegally in helping him procure the weapon. What information did you have to suggest that? Counsel-- --But tell me something. There is ten people in this house. There is ten people in this house and as I understand it from the questioning, they also knew other gang members were there. So even if they found gang colors, did they tell the manufacturer or the magistrate that -- what would that prove when there is multiple members in the house. Well, he admitted to that. What does that have to do with anything other than a general search -- a general search. Because again, in the hope of finding evidence of other crimes. That's what it sounds like. You keep adding facts that weren't in-- So what happens-- --below on that question? Following up on-- --the same question that Justice Kagan asked if your brethren, which is how about we find that it was reasonable to ask for the guns but not for the gang-related materials? What does that do with your claim, and do you disagree with the manner in which he described what the inquiry would be below, or before us now? ",counsel i think in the leon case that in fact just like the claim in this case that the affidavit be submit to supervisor and the court create the leon test in spite of that so to say that we have a case on point leon itself be on point we create the test in the face supervisor s review you be not actually be you argue a nuremberg defense now that that simply because supervisor decide that it be okay that that exculpates someone from responsibility all right then let us go to the other two way that i think you be ask us to overrule our precedent the first be use subjective information that a police officer know but have not disclose in the warrant I be have a little bit of difficulty understand how an entire warrant regime that presume that the magistrate have all pertinent information and that be why you would be let off the hook how you can excuse a police officer when he do not place that information in front of the magistrate tell me how this case the bare bone affidavit be sufficient all it say be that this defendant be a member of a gang but when the police officer be question he be ask whether this crime at issue have any connection to his gang relationship and the answer be no so how be the request of the warrant to search for all gang relate indicia anything more than the general warrant that our found father in part pass the fourth amendment against this be almost like what do we do with the officer s testimony when he say do you have any reason to believe there we be any more weapon in the house he say no what when an officer say that why would then he think that he have complete license to go and ask for a warrant that be look for more gun when there be only evidence of him possess one so you be answer you be answer justice ginsburg by say that any time a gang member commit any crime the police be entitle to seek a warrant that permit the search for anything they have in their home that relate to their gang membership and to to gun that do not involve by the officer s admission and your own that be not gang relate the assault but wait a minute that have nothing to do with the gang unless you be say that you have proof that the gang do something illegally in help him procure the weapon what information do you have to suggest that counsel but tell me something there be ten people in this house there be ten people in this house and as i understand it from the questioning they also know other gang member we be there so even if they find gang color do they tell the manufacturer or the magistrate that what would that prove when there be multiple member in the house well he admit to that what do that have to do with anything other than a general search a general search because again in the hope of find evidence of other crime that be what it sound like you keep add fact that be not in so what happen below on that question follow up on the same question that justice kagan ask if your brother which be how about we find that it be reasonable to ask for the gun but not for the gang relate material what do that do with your claim and do you disagree with the manner in which he describe what the inquiry would be below or before us now ,236.31,Roberts Court,"Dec 5, 2011","Curt Messerschmidt, et al.","Augusta Millender, et al.",10-704,"Jun 27, 2011","Feb 22, 2012",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2011,RadLAX Gateway Hotel v. Amalgamated Bank,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"It makes no sense to me what you are saying, because under all circumstances the credit bid, unless the property is valued higher than the credit bid amount, but then another bidder could -- could make -- enter that bid. The maximum value always has to be the value of the credit. If the -- if the -- if the creditor is willing to put it at risk that way. But that's just not true from what you just said. Meaning what you just said is that the buyer obviously is paying other things off, and by definition he's deducting that from the purchase price. No one gives a purchase price for a piece of property and agrees to pay something else and gives the highest price for the property once they've done that. So what you're asking for is permission for the debtor to use this property to pay other debts, and that's what I thought a secured interest prevented. So why doesn't he get-- --Why doesn't he get everything that the buyer is promising to everyone else? For that indubitably is part of the price, because he is giving out money to others, that's part of the value of this property. So why isn't the creditor, the secured creditor, entitled to all of the proceeds from the property? Not -- with sales price, but not from all the payments. You still haven't answered my-- --You still haven't answered my question. If the buyer had money that he's willing to give up to others, why isn't he putting it in the purchase price? Why isn't that part of the price? Could you explain what the reasoning is for requiring a credit bid if property is sold during the plan, but not permitting it when it's sold at the plan's-- --Doesn't that delay the bankruptcy in every situation? I can't actually understand what benefit other than delay of the bankruptcy process that would occasion. Uh-hmm. They don't have that right now? The vast majority of bankruptcy courts have permitted credit bidding in these situations. So if the vast majority of bankruptcies have stalking horses, then the norm is working without us having to rule in your favor. And stalking horses still come in. So it's not as if the 363(k) procedure is failing in maximizing prices. Could you tell me what the -- what's the purpose -- if you permit credit bidding, why do you go through the sale at all, if it's always -- if the credit is always going to be higher than the value? Why don't you just turn over the property under (iii)? Why do you -- why do you go through the sham of a sale? So it is the stalking horse dance. At what point do they credit bid until they get the highest price from someone else and then let that other person have it, is that it? When do you think under 363(k), what's good -- what would constitute or has constituted in the case law good cause not to permit credit bidding? What situations have arisen under 363(k) where a court has found good cause? I'm sorry. What-- --How does a creditor commit malfeasance? Counsel, I'm a person who believes that in the business world the greatest security is just knowledge of what courts will do. And what the two courts who have agreed with you have done is contrary to what the majority of courts have done for the longest time. What's the value for us upsetting the norm? What's the business value for upsetting the norm? That it means, because people didn't think they could do it in plan sales. So why should we upset the expectation?

2011,Reynolds v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Could you clarify that answer? The -- are you admitting that there were no criminal enforcement options for the Attorney General under the Wetterling Act for acts committed prior to 1996? Is that what you're saying? And that included all individuals who had -- who had been convicted of sex abuse acts before 1996? Excuse me. Let me go back to that question, counselor -- to that answer. Let's assume we accepted the Solicitor General's understanding of the rule, that it was illegal to travel -- that you had to be -- had to register from the start of SORNA. What challenge do you have left either to the interim rule in 2007 or to the final rules in 2008? make? What -- what challenge could you conceivably make? What would be the basis of that challenge? What would have obligated him to take your client out of SORNA? Could you -- could you tell me why? What would be an abuse of his discretion if he didn't take your client out? standing. argument. But we're in a circular argument. What would have commanded him to take your client out? You -- you would have to bring some sort of suit that said he abused his discretion. On what basis would he have -- what would be your claim of abuse other than, I really want my client out? But what impact would the interim rules have had on you? Arrested for a misdemeanor to do what? I thought Justice Kagan's question was, what would have stopped Congress from just saying: You have to register on the day of passage. There was nothing to stop Congress from doing that, correct? That's your reason for why they didn't do that. They didn't make it automatic, correct? That's your argument? Let's -- Is there anything -- If I understand the Solicitor General's position, all your client had to do after SORNA was passed was after a reasonable amount of time, or upon his travel, to tell Missouri, which was his state of conviction, that he was moving. Correct? Right. No, I'm not assuming that. Would he have been in compliance with SORNA under the final rules today, the interim rules when they were passed, or on the date that he left if he had when he traveled, or a reasonable time thereafter, told his state of conviction that he had moved? Would that have been enough? What does he have to do in addition to that under the interim or final rules? So how do they know where to register? Do you agree with your adversary that -- that they have to register under SORNA? So how were they supposed to know when or how they would register until the Attorney General acted? I'm not talking about those people. Not the people who can comply with (b). I'm talking about the people-- --But the question -- you are starting from a proposition, counsel, it seems to me, that Congress necessarily and under all circumstances thought that it had to include pre-SORNA convictions. But I don't know -- yes, it wanted a uniform system, but it had State systems in place, it had an imperfect Wetterling Act in place. It had lots of other mechanisms in place to punish non-registrants. So you are starting from the proposition that by necessity they wanted to include preconviction felonies. But I guess for those of us who believe in legislative history, and I know many of my colleagues don't believe in it or pay attention to it, there were two bills passed on SORNA, one a House bill that made it very clear, explicitly clear that it applied to pre-SORNA conviction felons; and the Senate bill which under the label Retroactivity had the terms that (d) now has. Doesn't that suggest to us that Congress itself was unsure of whether it wanted to include the pre-SORNA convictions or not? I guess my problem is that you make an assumption, you continue to make an assumption that if the Attorney General hadn't acted -- that the Attorney General was incapable of acting quickly. I mean, if the Attorney General had within a few months done what he ultimately did a year later or whatever time period after, had come out and said, it applies; this is what you do; briefly, you register wherever you were convicted or -- et cetera, if you move or change your name, then Congress would have accomplished the goal it wanted.

2011,Astrue v. Capato,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"There was in my memory, and it's been a while, that some States, if not all -- and that's what I was going to ask you, basically deem any child born during the marriage to be a child of the marriage, whether it's a biological child or not, so that if a mother has had a relationship outside of marriage the married parent is still responsible for that child. That would take care of, I think, a great number, wouldn't it, of the new technology births that occur without perhaps the input of one of -- the biological input of one of the parents? Yes. My question was, do all States have similar rulings? And for those that don't, what happens to a child that's been born with, as Justice Roberts said, as the Chief said, with new technology? What happens to that child in terms of their definition of whether they will be considered a child for Social Security purposes? Rebuttable presumption or irrebuttable? May I ask? Justice Scalia said that the statute is ambiguous. Is that your position? Is it your position that the definition of ""child"" is ambiguous and that we have to give the agency deference, or is it your position that in the context it's unambiguous and even if the Social Security Administration wanted to extend benefits, it couldn't, in the circumstances of this case? Excuse me. Could you tell me what purpose 416(h) serves in this statute? --given that you believe that 416(e) is self-sufficient unto itself. As the child who should receive. So what the purpose of (h)? So the -- a child who was born during marriage but is not a biological child wouldn't qualify? Even though they qualify under State law as a child? So what this -- let's assume Ms. Capato remarried but used her deceased husband's sperm to birth two children. They are the biological children of the Capatos. Would they qualify for survivor benefits even though she is now remarried? Well, you see, a situation like that is what is making me uncomfortable, because I don't see the words ""biological"" in the statute. I don't see the word ""marriage"" directly when -- within the definition of ""child"". So where do I draw them from? Where do I come-- --But that would be true under State intestate law. I am interested as to what your definition of child is. Is it just a biological offspring? Is it limited to a biological offspring born of a particular marriage? But in what context? Because we go back to Justice Ginsburg's question of what happens if the -- if the decedent is the mother. There is no question that she bore this child. Married or unmarried, does it matter? Does marriage matter only if it's the father that's the decedent? What is your -- if you are a sperm donor, does any offspring that sperm donor have qualify? So the mother who is unmarried who bears a child, this child is not automatically covered. Oh, so there are situations in which you think those provisions should govern. This is what was not clear to me. So you are -- you are not arguing that ""child"" has just one natural meaning. In whatever meaning you could give it. How -- do you think that Congress thought of either of these situations as real possibilities? Do you really think that the 1939 Congress, or even the one that passed the later statute, ever thought that a State would disinherit a naturally born -- all naturally born children -- or that children could be born 18 months, 4 years, 50 years later? They weren't thinking of either. So the question becomes, given the language of (h) that says define ""child"" this way throughout the subchapter, why shouldn't we give that directive its plain meaning? That's really the argument that you have to convince us of. That's because every State law recognized them as such as well. Correct? ",there be in my memory and it be be a while that some state if not all and that be what i be go to ask you basically deem any child bear during the marriage to be a child of the marriage whether it be a biological child or not so that if a mother have have a relationship outside of marriage the married parent be still responsible for that child that would take care of i think a great number would not it of the new technology birth that occur without perhaps the input of one of the biological input of one of the parent yes my question be do all state have similar ruling and for those that do not what happen to a child that be be bear with as justice robert say as the chief say with new technology what happen to that child in term of their definition of whether they will be consider a child for social security purpose rebuttable presumption or irrebuttable may i ask justice scalia say that the statute be ambiguous be that your position be it your position that the definition of child be ambiguous and that we have to give the agency deference or be it your position that in the context it be unambiguous and even if the social security administration want to extend benefit it could not in the circumstance of this case excuse me could you tell me what purpose h serve in this statute give that you believe that e be self sufficient unto itself as the child who should receive so what the purpose of h so the a child who be bear during marriage but be not a biological child would not qualify even though they qualify under state law as a child so what this let us assume ms capato remarry but use her deceased husband s sperm to birth two child they be the biological child of the capatos would they qualify for survivor benefit even though she be now remarry well you see a situation like that be what be make me uncomfortable because i do not see the word biological in the statute i do not see the word marriage directly when within the definition of child so where do i draw them from where do i come but that would be true under state intestate law i be interested as to what your definition of child be be it just a biological offspring be it limit to a biological offspring born of a particular marriage but in what context because we go back to justice ginsburg s question of what happen if the if the decedent be the mother there be no question that she bore this child marry or unmarried do it matter do marriage matter only if it be the father that be the decedent what be your if you be a sperm donor do any offspring that sperm donor have qualify so the mother who be unmarried who bear a child this child be not automatically cover oh so there be situation in which you think those provision should govern this be what be not clear to me so you be you be not argue that child have just one natural meaning in whatever meaning you could give it how do you think that congress thought of either of these situation as real possibility do you really think that the congress or even the one that pass the late statute ever think that a state would disinherit a naturally bear all naturally bear child or that child could be bear month year year later they be not think of either so the question become give the language of h that say define child this way throughout the subchapter why should not we give that directive its plain meaning that be really the argument that you have to convince us of that be because every state law recognize them as such as well correct ,285.93,Roberts Court,"Mar 19, 2012","Michael J.

2011,Credit Suisse Securities LLC v. Simmonds,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, would-- --Well, the problem is that the injury here is the defendant's conduct, meaning if the nature of the claim, as is here, is that someone has received a profit they are not entitled to, then the injury is the same. The profit belonged to the shareholders or the corporation, not to the insider. So-- --textually the nature of the claim here is the very injury, plaintiff's injury. Well, disgorgement is injury, meaning that it's something that -- that you are taking away from someone else. Tell me what logic there is in reading this as a statute of repose, other than your argument about finality and its importance. If we take your adversary's position that this statute of limitations was geared under an understanding that an insider would in fact make the requirements -- would file the statements required by 16(a), then it makes absolute sense to think of it as a statute of repose. But if Congress understood that some wouldn't do the statutory requirement and file in a timely manner, why wouldn't equitable tolling be a more appropriate way to look at this? Is there a public document that a -- that a shareholder can look at to see whether an insider has traded within 6 months? I didn't ask that. I'm going back to Justice Alito's question, which is how easy is it to find out without the 16(a)? That's a big thing. I didn't ask maybe. So what is the likelihood that a broker's going to turn you in? That's a very nice thing, but how likely is that? How would the broker know that the -- that his principal didn't file a form he was required to? Tell me what was hidden from you in the prior filings in the academic literature that your adversary points to? All of the facts you've just recited have been written about extensively for years and years. So, what new information did you receive, told you that you should file a lawsuit? You mean to tell me that somebody's investing in the amounts that are invested here and they are not following the fact that this has been the center of securities litigation for years?

2011,Miller v. Alabama,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I'm sorry. I thought you just said a second earlier that you had a bifurcated rule: No life without parole whatsoever for 15 and under, and no mandatory life for 16 -- 15 and over. How do you -- how do you write the opinion to do the bifurcated rule? What justifies an absolute ban at a certain age and a modified ban above an age, and how do you deal with Harmelin with respect to the second part of your rule-- --if Harmelin says we don't look at individualized sentencing? So, how do we get rid of the mandatory if that's what we're were going to do? Counsel, there is no question that you're dealing with a much smaller universe of children sentenced to life without parole who are 14 and under. There's an argument that that's because so few of them commit the crimes. But putting that aside, the universe is rather small. All right? There is a much, much larger group, as Justice Kennedy pointed out, for life without parole for juveniles at 15 and above. Go back to my question. I need an answer to it. Which is, assuming-- --the bifurcated theory that you proffered, tell me how we get around Harmelin. How would you write that decision? There wasn't a majority in theory in Harmelin, and -- but at least three Justices spoke about a gross disproportionality. Is it your views that life -- a mandatory life without parole for someone like a juvenile is grossly disproportionate? That happened in Jackson. Counsel-- --Actually, I do want to ask, and it dovetails with what Justice Breyer is asking, the Edmund/Tison line for adults, which is we can't execute someone who hasn't killed, intended to kill or was reckless in killing. This is a question more in the Jackson case, because I think it's an issue there. But although all murder is heinous and regrettable, there are different kinds of murder. That's why some people are subject to the death penalty and others are not. And I do see a world of difference between the Miller killing and the Jackson killing, vis-a -- vis, the individual defendants' personal liability. So, assuming there are different kinds of -- of killings -- of murder, should we be looking at the Edmund/Tison line at all? Should we be talking about its application to juveniles in a different way? Edmund/Tison basically, okay, felony murder if you know that there's a gun involved, but should that line be the same for juveniles? And, if so, then how do you go back to justifying, as Justice Breyer spoke about, the mandatory nature of life imprisonment without parole, given that not every juvenile is equal and not every murder is equal with respect to them? That is not an individual legislative determination. That is -- that is just-- Could you start -- I know that Enmund and Tison has to do with death eligibility with respect to adults, but it does draw a line between death eligibility with respect to intentionality or not, or recklessness. Assuming for the sake of argument that some of us might be interested in whether a line should be created for juveniles who intended or didn't intend death, with respect to their eligibility for life without parole, whether it's mandatory or voluntary, how would we write that? Would -- would we just import all the Enmund and Tison jurisprudence? Or would we say something different with respect to juveniles? That has to do with your general rule, which -- which we shouldn't impose it at all. But if we go even to your second step rule-- --assuming we bifurcate-- --then -- then we still have the question of when do we permit a mandatory imposition? Well, in fact, Jackson was convicted with a nonintent, just a felony-- --It doesn't matter. The jury didn't have to -- all the jury found was that he didn't meet his affirmative burden of proving. And he didn't counsel -- they didn't make a finding-- --as to what words were used and what the intent was. I'm not sure reckless indifference means that. Meaning if he knew they were carrying guns, doesn't that make him liable for the reckless indifference-- --whether he thought they would use them or not? Counsel, I -- I -- I know that this seems like block building, but I -- I think of law as sort of logical. If you are involved in a felony, and you counsel the felony where someone dies under Arkansas law, you are guilty of felony murder, correct? So whether or not that he intended to counsel the crime, he was guilty of felony murder, unless he could prove the affirmative defense, right? So obviously he didn't prove the affirmative defense, but that doesn't mean that the jury actually found that he used one set of words or another. It just means that they didn't believe that he had proven by his burden of proof that he had not counseled, correct? As a possibility-- --But not that it was an actual finding by the jury? All right. I'm sorry. What hope does he have? What hope does he have? I'm sorry-- --I thought he was life without parole. I thought he was sentenced to life without parole. How can the parole board-- ",I be sorry i think you just say a second early that you have a bifurcate rule no life without parole whatsoever for and under and no mandatory life for and over how do you how do you write the opinion to do the bifurcate rule what justify an absolute ban at a certain age and a modified ban above an age and how do you deal with harmelin with respect to the second part of your rule if harmelin say we do not look at individualized sentencing so how do we get rid of the mandatory if that be what we be we be go to do counsel there be no question that you be deal with a much small universe of child sentence to life without parole who be and under there be an argument that that be because so few of them commit the crime but put that aside the universe be rather small all right there be a much much large group as justice kennedy point out for life without parole for juvenile at and above go back to my question i need an answer to it which be assume the bifurcated theory that you proffer tell me how we get around harmelin how would you write that decision there be not a majority in theory in harmelin and but at least three justice speak about a gross disproportionality be it your view that life a mandatory life without parole for someone like a juvenile be grossly disproportionate that happen in jackson counsel actually i do want to ask and it dovetail with what justice breyer be ask the edmundtison line for adult which be we can not execute someone who have not kill intend to kill or be reckless in kill this be a question more in the jackson case because i think it be an issue there but although all murder be heinous and regrettable there be different kind of murder that be why some people be subject to the death penalty and others be not and i do see a world of difference between the miller killing and the jackson killing vis a vi the individual defendant personal liability so assume there be different kind of of killing of murder should we be look at the edmundtison line at all should we be talk about its application to juvenile in a different way edmundtison basically okay felony murder if you know that there be a gun involve but should that line be the same for juvenile and if so then how do you go back to justifying as justice breyer speak about the mandatory nature of life imprisonment without parole give that not every juvenile be equal and not every murder be equal with respect to them that be not an individual legislative determination that be that be just could you start i know that enmund and tison have to do with death eligibility with respect to adult but it do draw a line between death eligibility with respect to intentionality or not or recklessness assume for the sake of argument that some of us might be interested in whether a line should be create for juvenile who intend or do not intend death with respect to their eligibility for life without parole whether it be mandatory or voluntary how would we write that would would we just import all the enmund and tison jurisprudence or would we say something different with respect to juvenile that have to do with your general rule which which we should not impose it at all but if we go even to your second step rule assume we bifurcate then then we still have the question of when do we permit a mandatory imposition well in fact jackson be convict with a nonintent just a felony it do not matter the jury do not have to all the jury find be that he do not meet his affirmative burden of prove and he do not counsel they do not make a finding as to what word we be use and what the intent be I be not sure reckless indifference mean that meaning if he know they we be carry gun do not that make him liable for the reckless indifference whether he think they would use them or not counsel i i i know that this seem like block building but i i think of law as sort of logical if you be involve in a felony and you counsel the felony where someone die under arkansas law you be guilty of felony murder correct so whether or not that he intend to counsel the crime he be guilty of felony murder unless he could prove the affirmative defense right so obviously he do not prove the affirmative defense but that do not mean that the jury actually find that he use one set of word or another it just mean that they do not believe that he have prove by his burden of proof that he have not counsel correct as a possibility but not that it be an actual finding by the jury all right I be sorry what hope do he have what hope do he have I be sorry i think he be life without parole i think he be sentence to life without parole how can the parole board ,355.77000000000015,Roberts Court,"Mar 20, 2012",Evan Miller,Alabama,10-9646,"Nov 7, 2011","Jun 25, 2012",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

It seems to me that there is enough evidence that the lawyer was the one who held the investigation; the people who attended the meeting between the lawyer, the Respondent, and the other personnel that were there were acceding to what he was doing. The chief -- he goes to the chief and he says: I want you to do this. And the chief is relying on him, not his own independent judgment, to issue the command that's contested here. So, that sort of puts your argument on its head, because it appears that he was more the independent investigator than he was-- --the individual under the control of the agency. This argument seems to fall under what Justice Scalia termed the functional test, that he's serving just like any other government lawyer. If you are going to fit this case under the Richardson majority test, how would you do it? Well, that would be a breach of his duty as an attorney. And he would be subject to malpractice in that case. You -- seriously, I find this whole argument about market forces with respect to attorneys representing people odd, because there is a whole slew of unemployed lawyers who would be happy to take on any government service they can. So going back to the -- that's -- what I consider the central argument you are making, which is: will it chill advice? And I'm not sure how it can, given the independent fiduciary duty that an attorney has to zealously guard his or her client's interest. But don't we have-- --That's not true of most lawyers. Most lawyers are not part of the civil service -- internal lawyers are not part of the civil service system. They're generally considered employees at will.

2011,Douglas v. Independent Living Center of Southern California,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Excuse me. Were those -- were those amendments submitted before they took effect or after they had taken affect, like here? That's where I'm a little bit confused. The injunction here only stopped you from implementing the rate changes until you got approval from HHS in its administrative process that it was going to approve the amendment, correct? That's a separate question about whether the courts are required to give deference to an HHS finding. But the injunction here wasn't one that said you could never do this. It just said go finish the process, right? And if it's not, could you please -- you said yes, it is. But give me the theoretical foundation? The Supremacy Clause doesn't, I am assuming you agree with your -- with Petitioner that it doesn't provide for a cause of action? Is that your position? Then what gets all of the cases that we've had since 1824 into this Court that have granted injunctive relief on supremacy arguments? Well, but we have plenty that don't -- King, Townsend, Carlson. We have had many others that are not dissimilar to this case. So go back and explain to me how all of those cases, what's the theoretical. So go to your Petitioner's response to one of my colleague's -- to Justice Scalia, when she said yes, if these providers decide to charge the old rate to their patients, the State will go after them. How is that any different than the cases where we are talking about railroads charging -- not charging customers more than a State commands because the penalty's too high, or those types of cases that fall into this preemptive category that you're talking about? But you haven't explained how that's theoretically different than the example I just gave you. Can I ask -- why are you fighting Justice Breyer so much? It sounds like you are and that's why I am having some difficulty. There are two points. Following up on his and then my second question. Engage the Solicitor General's question that this isn't a cause of action under the Supremacy Clause, but that it is a cause of action under some implied equitable-- --doctrine, okay? Which may square enough now. Coming back to Justice Breyer's question. I agree with all you were trying to say about what the State did or didn't do here, but if it's a primary jurisdiction question, what's wrong with just saying that the court's power is limited under equity to issuing an injunction that gives the matter over to the administrative agency that puts in the status quo -- assuming there is some sort of violation of Federal law or seeming violation of Federal law -- a preventive injunction that just stops the State from acting until the administrative process concludes? What's wrong with that? No, no; they are saying you can't have any. But -- but Justice Breyer's question I think was slightly different, which is, what's the limit on the court's power? And how do you-- --But you engaged the question that -- the approach that the Solicitor General has been making, which is don't find a cause of action under the Supremacy Clause; find it in the court's -- an implied cause of action. Well, I might, if you continue in your earlier position that a Supremacy Clause cause of action would stop Congress from having a -- a voice in enforcement and cutting it off clearly. If Congress were to write a law that says no one can enforce this, either in damages or in injunctive relief, your earlier answer seemed to suggest that Congress didn't have the power under the Supremacy Clause to do that. If this were an equitable-- ",excuse me we be those we be those amendment submit before they take effect or after they have take affect like here that be where I be a little bit confused the injunction here only stop you from implement the rate change until you get approval from hhs in its administrative process that it be go to approve the amendment correct that be a separate question about whether the court be require to give deference to an hhs finding but the injunction here be not one that say you could never do this it just say go finish the process right and if it be not could you please you say yes it be but give me the theoretical foundation the supremacy clause do not i be assume you agree with your with petitioner that it do not provide for a because of action be that your position then what get all of the case that we have have since into this court that have grant injunctive relief on supremacy argument well but we have plenty that do not king townsend carlson we have have many others that be not dissimilar to this case so go back and explain to me how all of those case what be the theoretical so go to your petitioner s response to one of my colleague s to justice scalia when she say yes if these provider decide to charge the old rate to their patient the state will go after them how be that any different than the case where we be talk about railroad charge not charge customer more than a state command because the penalty s too high or those type of case that fall into this preemptive category that you be talk about but you have not explain how that be theoretically different than the example i just give you can i ask why be you fight justice breyer so much it sound like you be and that be why i be have some difficulty there be two point follow up on his and then my second question engage the solicitor general s question that this be not a because of action under the supremacy clause but that it be a because of action under some imply equitable doctrine okay which may square enough now come back to justice breyer s question i agree with all you we be try to say about what the state do or do not do here but if it be a primary jurisdiction question what be wrong with just say that the court s power be limit under equity to issue an injunction that give the matter over to the administrative agency that put in the status quo assume there be some sort of violation of federal law or seem violation of federal law a preventive injunction that just stop the state from act until the administrative process concludes what be wrong with that no no they be say you can not have any but but justice breyer s question i think be slightly different which be what be the limit on the court s power and how do you but you engage the question that the approach that the solicitor general have be make which be do not find a because of action under the supremacy clause find it in the court s an implied because of action well i might if you continue in your early position that a supremacy clause because of action would stop congress from have a a voice in enforcement and cut it off clearly if congress we be to write a law that say no one can enforce this either in damage or in injunctive relief your early answer seem to suggest that congress do not have the power under the supremacy clause to do that if this we be an equitable ,246.45000000000007,Roberts Court,"Oct 3, 2011","Toby Douglas, Director, California Department of Health Care Services","Independent Living Center of Southern California, Inc., et al.",09-958,"Jan 18, 2011","Feb 22, 2012",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2011,Lafler v. Cooper,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, isn't there a right to make a critical decision on whether to accept or reject a plea bargain, once offered? There is no right to demand one or to keep it, but isn't there a right to make that kind of critical decision? You can -- you can agree with that when 95 percent of the criminal cases are disposed of by way of bargaining? How can you talk about the reliability of a process or its fairness when you have an attorney who has fundamentally misgauged the law? How can a trial be fair when the attorney is going into a trial thinking his client can't be convicted because the shots fired hit below the waist? So how can that kind of trial ever be fair? If Justice Breyer permits me to add an addendum to give the reasons why I might agree with him, or a way of viewing this, as I read the lower court's decisions, they said there wasn't ineffectiveness, because he was just trying to get a better deal. And I think that, translating what he said, the very reasonable view by the court was, the prosecutor may think of a lesser charge, because if this guy really wanted to kill this woman he would have hit her head or her chest, but he aimed low, so he was really just angry and shooting enough so that if he hit her, okay, if she died, okay. But he really didn't have that heinous intent to execute a gunshot to the brain. And so he was hoping to negotiate something better. If that's -- and Justice Breyer's shaking his head. If that in fact, if this is an AEDPA case, and we have to give deference to the State courts, doesn't that resolve this case? We have to give deference to their finding. You're -- you are begging the question. Okay? Because yes, I think Justice Breyer's first statement, you have to prove the guy was going to take the plea, because there is no sense in -- in giving him a remedy that he would have never sought. All right? But it goes back to, I think it was Justice Alito or Chief -- or the Chief Justice's question of on what basis can the judge reject the plea? You have said earlier that he has to put aside any information he learned during the trial, and that's really the nub of this case. What are the grounds that you are proposing the judge can use to reject the plea? Counsel, what was the defense at trial? What was the defense at trial? Did he deny having committed the act of the shooting? At trial? Is it the case that in most of the cases in which motions of this kind are brought to trial judges if there is a defense of mistaken identity or of ""I didn't do it"", that judges often find the defendant has not proven that they would have taken the plea? In most cases in which a trial is had, where the defendant is pleading misidentification or: I just didn't do this act. In those cases, do most of the trial judges not permit or don't find that the defendant has met their burden of proving that he or she would have taken the plea? I thought of this case, and you can correct me if I am wrong, that your client told the attorney from the beginning: I did it; I want to plea. ",counsel be not there a right to make a critical decision on whether to accept or reject a plea bargain once offer there be no right to demand one or to keep it but be not there a right to make that kind of critical decision you can you can agree with that when percent of the criminal case be dispose of by way of bargaining how can you talk about the reliability of a process or its fairness when you have an attorney who have fundamentally misgauge the law how can a trial be fair when the attorney be go into a trial think his client can not be convict because the shot fire hit below the waist so how can that kind of trial ever be fair if justice breyer permit me to add an addendum to give the reason why i might agree with him or a way of view this as i read the low court s decision they say there be not ineffectiveness because he be just try to get a good deal and i think that translate what he say the very reasonable view by the court be the prosecutor may think of a less charge because if this guy really want to kill this woman he would have hit her head or her chest but he aim low so he be really just angry and shoot enough so that if he hit her okay if she die okay but he really do not have that heinous intent to execute a gunshot to the brain and so he be hop to negotiate something well if that be and justice breyer s shake his head if that in fact if this be an aedpa case and we have to give deference to the state court do not that resolve this case we have to give deference to their finding you be you be beg the question okay because yes i think justice breyer s first statement you have to prove the guy be go to take the plea because there be no sense in in give him a remedy that he would have never seek all right but it go back to i think it be justice alito or chief or the chief justice s question of on what basis can the judge reject the plea you have say earlier that he have to put aside any information he learn during the trial and that be really the nub of this case what be the ground that you be propose the judge can use to reject the plea counsel what be the defense at trial what be the defense at trial do he deny have commit the act of the shooting at trial be it the case that in most of the case in which motion of this kind be bring to trial judge if there be a defense of mistaken identity or of i do not do it that judge often find the defendant have not prove that they would have take the plea in most case in which a trial be have where the defendant be plead misidentification or i just do not do this act in those case do most of the trial judge not permit or do not find that the defendant have meet their burden of prove that he or she would have take the plea i thought of this case and you can correct me if i be wrong that your client tell the attorney from the beginning i do it i want to plea ,229.66000000000003,Roberts Court,"Oct 31, 2011","Blaine Lafler, Warden",Anthony Cooper,10-209,"Jan 7, 2011","Mar 21, 2012",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2011,Perry v. New Hampshire,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counselor, does your position depend on police involvement at all? I'm -- if a private investigator shows a picture or -- that has no connection to the police, a company's investigator? Or the news media publishes a picture of someone that it thinks-- Now we've changed the language of Wade when it talks about intentional or unintentional. And you're suggesting that police manipulation always has to be intentionally suggestive? Even if the policeman tells you he wasn't really thinking or focusing on a distinguishing characteristic in the line-up? Could you tell me what you think would have happened here? there was a reason the police asked this defendant to stay put. They didn't want him to leave the scene, correct? In your judgment -- I think Justice Kennedy hit the nail on the head. My suspicion is that at some point they would have asked the witnesses in the building and engaged in a show-up. What's so different between intentionally doing the show-up and holding the defendant in the back yard standing there next to a police officer, so that anyone who wants to, like this woman, who wants to find the guy, can just point to that one? What's the difference? No. I mean, the way not to skew it was to put him in the police car and just let him sit there in the dark. So they intentionally made him wait at the scene of the crime. I'm not talking about whether this was necessary or unnecessary, because I think that a perfectly good argument could be made that the police acted reasonably and necessarily; all right? It makes no sense to move a defendant that far from the scene of a crime if you're not sure he is the one who committed the crime, he or she. But I'm -- I'm going to the question of how do we define, if we write this opinion, manipulation without getting into a mens rea type analysis and adding yet another layer to Biggers. So tell me -- they gave the hypothetical of the police pointing out the defendant out the window. But earlier you said it might be a different case if the defendant was two blocks away and they brought him back. Same scenario. They do that, bring him back two blocks; make him stand at the scene of the crime; and go upstairs, talk to the woman and she spontaneously says: It's the guy standing over there. That would entitle the defendant to a Wade motion? To a Wade hearing? We are now -- we are now at mens rea again. So what has surprised me about this case is in some ways the way the State court wrote this. Because if the State court had simply said something like, there was no unnecessary show-up here, they were just holding someone until they could figure out what happened, there was no suggestiveness by the police, because the woman pointed out the window, throw out the motion, we wouldn't be here. The argument has become something else now because you're trying to define a level of intent on the part of the police to create unreliability that I think just complicates the inquiry. Well, what's happened is that your briefing and your counter's briefing is broader than I think needs to be on the facts of this case. But putting that aside, you've addressed this as the need for police manipulation. If you define it that way, then we do get into a mens rea discussion rather than what I think Biggers and Wade were about, which is are the circumstances created by the police unnecessarily suggestive. --that already follow your adversary rules. I think it's not just one or two. It's about five or six. The floodgates open there? How many -- how many suppressions of witness identification has occurred in those circuits?

2011,Blueford v. Arkansas,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, one-- --Counsel, I thought that part of your argument was that, given the instructions in this case, which the jury appears to have followed to the T, they can't get to a lesser count unless they have acquitted on the preceding count. When the judge asks them, did you reach criminal negligence, they say: We were told not to. Now, the judge, whether he was right or wrong under Hughes as to whether they followed the instructions or he misunderstood them, I don't know. But it's very clear in context from the government's arguments to the jury, to the defense argument to the jury, you don't reach the split count or even talk about it unless you've been acquitted. So, given that the jury responds at the end, we haven't reached a verdict; and the jury said earlier that they hadn't reached a verdict on the one issue, isn't the -- the only assumption is that they didn't go back? Counsel, what do several States have? If I read what those States you're saying, including the Massachusetts State that you point to, it's a very simple rule, and you seem to be arguing past it or around it or -- I think what they say is, once the jury announces an acquittal, then that's the substance, the person's been acquitted, once they have made a judgment and announced it. It -- the Constitution doesn't -- the Double Jeopardy Clause doesn't entitle someone to have it announced, doesn't entitle someone to force the jury to announce it. But if the jury gets up at the end of the trial in a State that doesn't permit partial verdicts and said, contrary to the instructions of the judge, contrary to the law of the State, the jury says, we acquitted on counts one and two, we're hung on count three, the Constitution says jeopardy attaches because there has been an announcement of a verdict. Isn't that your position? Well, our case in Ball says it doesn't matter whether a judgment is entered or not. As far back as 1896, Ball said the judgment is irrelevant. It is the verdict of acquittal, and it basically equated that verdict with -- it doesn't matter if -- if it's entered properly, if the jury is polled, if anything happens. It's as soon as the jury announces acquittal, that's the operative double jeopardy kicker. Isn't that what you're saying? And I thought I heard you arguing that here the lack of manifest necessity was that the judge had heard they reached that verdict. And he should not have discharged the jury without asking them could they reach a verdict that -- had they reached the verdict that they announced. I'm sorry. I'm so totally confused by you ignoring Hughes. The Arkansas charge says: ""If you have a reasonable doubt of the defendant's guilt on the charge of capital murder, you will consider the charge of murder in the first degree. "" And I thought the Arkansas cases said no one juror is going to think they can go to the next count. They have to understand from this charge that it has to be unanimous. And that's what the prosecutor argued, it's what the defense argued, it's what your Supreme Court has said has to happen. I'm a little confused given your case law, your Supreme Court case law, that says you can't move on to the next one unless it's unanimous. How you can answer Justice Kagan's question the way you have. There is nothing in your case law-- --For instance if they had -- if the judge had called them back in and said, are you deadlocked on the third count. And my hypothetical to your adversary, they said, well, we have acquitted on capital murder, we've acquitted on the second count, we are still, judge, deadlocked. If this had been announced at the very end, what would be your position today? Doesn't sound like the judge was interested in any of the defense counsel's positions on mistrial. He announced whether the jury told them they were deadlocked or not he was going to call them back. So I don't know that the judge would have done what you suggested. Because the judge -- the defense attorney did ask for partial verdicts after their first announcement. So if the state rule says we don't take partial verdicts and the judge had entered a verdict -- a judgment -- declared a mistrial or entered a judgment saying hung jury as to all counts, would jeopardy have attached. No. If the jury had announced what it did, but following Arkansas law, as you read it, you don't take partial verdicts, it could only be one hung jury. Jeopardy has attached. So the only issue here is whether it's reasonable to conclude that a jury that has been told acquit first comes back and says, we're only hung on this, and the jury says, listen to each other on what your hung on, that that jury reasonably -- the judge could have ignored their stated verdict and entered a trial -- a mistrial on everything else. General, how do you deal with our cases, Ball, Martin Linen, and the whole line that says the State -- the form of State law judgments doesn't control? I'm not sure what that means. And that's the problem with all of this area, which is -- States vary on how they enter judgments after the jury speaks its verdict. So where do we draw the line as to when a State law trumps -- when a Federal law, the Double Jeopardy Clause -- trumps a State system? General, other than trenching on State rules that don't create the constitutional protection, what's wrong with a simple rule that says, once a jury announces that it is unanimous on acquittal of a count, you can't go back unless the jury says that it's not unanimous in some way? What's wrong with that rule? Why? The jury comes out and says, we're unanimous. There is a poll. One juror says, I'm really not unanimous. They go back. But once a jury says it's unanimous, a judge can't declare a mistrial, can't do something until it ensures itself that jeopardy has attached. I'm not -- I'm not asking -- I'm not announcing or setting a rule that says you have to ask them, you have to force them to give a verdict. I mean, I'm saying, what's wrong with the constitutional rule that simply says: Once the jury says we're unanimous, there can't be manifest injustice -- there can't be manifest necessity until you're sure that they can't reach a verdict -- that that verdict is not their verdict. That's what three State courts have said. Three State courts have said, if there is any meaning to jeopardy, it is that once a jury out loud says to a defendant, you're not guilty, the defendant is entitled to rely on that. So what's wrong with that simple rule? ",counsel one counsel i think that part of your argument be that give the instruction in this case which the jury appear to have follow to the t they can not get to a less count unless they have acquit on the precede count when the judge ask them do you reach criminal negligence they say we we be tell not to now the judge whether he be right or wrong under hughes as to whether they follow the instruction or he misunderstand them i do not know but it be very clear in context from the government s argument to the jury to the defense argument to the jury you do not reach the split count or even talk about it unless you have be acquit so give that the jury respond at the end we have not reach a verdict and the jury say early that they have not reach a verdict on the one issue be not the the only assumption be that they do not go back counsel what do several state have if i read what those state you be say include the massachusetts state that you point to it be a very simple rule and you seem to be argue past it or around it or i think what they say be once the jury announce an acquittal then that be the substance the person s be acquit once they have make a judgment and announce it it the constitution do not the double jeopardy clause do not entitle someone to have it announce do not entitle someone to force the jury to announce it but if the jury get up at the end of the trial in a state that do not permit partial verdict and say contrary to the instruction of the judge contrary to the law of the state the jury say we acquit on count one and two we be hang on count three the constitution say jeopardy attache because there have be an announcement of a verdict be not that your position well our case in ball say it do not matter whether a judgment be enter or not as far back as ball say the judgment be irrelevant it be the verdict of acquittal and it basically equate that verdict with it do not matter if if it be enter properly if the jury be poll if anything happen it be as soon as the jury announces acquittal that be the operative double jeopardy kicker be not that what you be say and i think i hear you argue that here the lack of manifest necessity be that the judge have hear they reach that verdict and he should not have discharge the jury without ask them could they reach a verdict that have they reach the verdict that they announce I be sorry I be so totally confuse by you ignore hughes the arkansas charge say if you have a reasonable doubt of the defendant s guilt on the charge of capital murder you will consider the charge of murder in the first degree and i think the arkansas case say no one juror be go to think they can go to the next count they have to understand from this charge that it have to be unanimous and that be what the prosecutor argue it be what the defense argue it have what your supreme court have say have to happen I be a little confused give your case law your supreme court case law that say you can not move on to the next one unless it be unanimous how you can answer justice kagan s question the way you have there be nothing in your case law for instance if they have if the judge have call them back in and say be you deadlocked on the third count and my hypothetical to your adversary they say well we have acquit on capital murder we have acquit on the second count we be still judge deadlocked if this have be announce at the very end what would be your position today do not sound like the judge be interested in any of the defense counsel s position on mistrial he announce whether the jury tell them they we be deadlocked or not he be go to call them back so i do not know that the judge would have do what you suggest because the judge the defense attorney do ask for partial verdict after their first announcement so if the state rule say we do not take partial verdict and the judge have enter a verdict a judgment declare a mistrial or enter a judgment say hung jury as to all count would jeopardy have attach no if the jury have announce what it do but follow arkansas law as you read it you do not take partial verdict it could only be one hung jury jeopardy have attach so the only issue here be whether it be reasonable to conclude that a jury that have be tell acquit first come back and say we be only hung on this and the jury say listen to each other on what your hung on that that jury reasonably the judge could have ignore their state verdict and enter a trial a mistrial on everything else general how do you deal with our case ball martin linen and the whole line that say the state the form of state law judgment do not control I be not sure what that mean and that be the problem with all of this area which be state vary on how they enter judgment after the jury speak its verdict so where do we draw the line as to when a state law trump when a federal law the double jeopardy clause trump a state system general other than trench on state rule that do not create the constitutional protection what be wrong with a simple rule that say once a jury announce that it be unanimous on acquittal of a count you can not go back unless the jury say that it be not unanimous in some way what be wrong with that rule why the jury come out and say we be unanimous there be a poll one juror say I be really not unanimous they go back but once a jury say it be unanimous a judge can not declare a mistrial can not do something until it ensure itself that jeopardy have attach I be not I be not ask I be not announce or set a rule that say you have to ask them you have to force them to give a verdict i mean I be say what be wrong with the constitutional rule that simply say once the jury say we be unanimous there can not be manifest injustice there can not be manifest necessity until you be sure that they can not reach a verdict that that verdict be not their verdict that be what three state court have say three state court have say if there be any meaning to jeopardy it be that once a jury out loud say to a defendant you be not guilty the defendant be entitle to rely on that so what be wrong with that simple rule ,470.35,Roberts Court,"Feb 22, 2012",Alex

2011,Taniguchi v. Kan Pacific Saipan,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Can I make sure that I understand the extent of your argument? Are you saying that it's interpretation, oral interpretation, just in the courtroom? I -- I have to say that if you read it the way you do, then what you are suggesting is that for appointed experts, they only get recompensed for the time they're testifying, because that's the only time they spend in court. Yes. But court experts get-- a -- get paid for their prep work. Could I -- one further question. I take all your arguments, but I read the common dictionary and there is no question that the primary meaning of ""interpreter"" is interpretation of oral languages. But the dictionary is broad enough to include translation work as well. Given that the courts for 70 years have been awarding, most of the them -- except for I think the Seventh here, virtually every court over a 70-year period has been awarding translation fees as -- as authorized; why shouldn't that be enough for us? Meaning, if the dictionary term is broad enough and that's what the courts have been doing and the world hasn't crashed, despite one case where a large amount was given -- your adversary points to the fact that most of the translation fees tend to be fairly reasonable -- why should we muck with what works? I think I am drawing -- I am drawing from ways that my colleague next to me usually asks a question. [Laughter] Could we get back to the issue. In the legislative history of this provision, is there any indication that Congress explicitly rejected translation work from its coverage? Outside of the text. Is there a statement by one of the sponsors in the congressional bill? Those are the other provisions that they passed with respect to-- --So if a lawyer sits down with an interpreter now in his office and says to the interpreter, ""I can't pay for translation work. "" ""Now, you sit here and interpret what this letter says for me. "" Is that what we're asking lawyers to do now-- --if we accept your reading? But you would say that might be different in a courtroom. Because the lawyer is communicating something live. It could be in the courtroom, but not outside. Is there something logical about this? I guess I'm -- I'm having a problem with they're ""potentially large"". Interpretive services are potentially large, although you claim that they don't -- they have sort of a terminus point. I've been in trials where we've had multiple languages simultaneously being translated to multiple defendants, with witnesses speaking even other languages. I was in the Southern District of New York. And fees there without translation, just for the oral courtroom work, sometimes went ahead for months. So potentiality's not the question. If you're talking about disproportionality, then that goes to the word ""reasonable"" in the statute, doesn't it? I mean, the Ortho case you point to, the court did sizably cut the translation fees. And more importantly, from the little I can tell, that was a huge patent case with a patent that was claimed to control 60 percent of a market. So I don't know that that was a small case by anyone's definition. As far back as 19 -- It was a district court. But it was as far back as the 1930s. Some in the '40s, some in the '50s. No, no. Clearly. But these awards have been common. You are like daring Justice Alito to go do this now. [Laughter] Justice Breyer is asking, can you think of an example where words are not on their face plain, and the court has looked to the practices that have been impugned into that word incentive and we decided that they will be accepted in the way that practice has given them meaning?

2011,Kurns v. Railroad Friction Products Corp.,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"So what do you -- what do you make of the ICC in 1916, in the Tiller case, regulating the lights that railroads had to have, locomotives had to have in the yard, and that those lights had to differ when the railroad was in use. I'm not sure I understand. It prescribed different lights when the -- when the -- when the locomotive was in the yard. That had nothing to do with safety in use. It had to do with safety in repair. Distinguish for me our reasoning in the Ray case. Distinguish for me the difference in the Ray case, that had to do with navigation, and where we held that the agency, in ensuring safety in navigation, controlled design completely, whether in repair or not. So how do we -- why don't we apply the logic of Ray to this case? That's the argument here, which is-- --once you regulate what -- what the design or use of asbestos is, you're interfering with what available components there are for locomotives. So you're giving up all of your other claims? I'm not sure I understand this. Are you talking about wearing a particular hazard suit? Are you talking about blowing out air? Are you talking about changing the design so the asbestos comes off without the dust cloud that's generally created? If the manufacturer is really not controlling the repair shop, of what value is this failure to warn claim? They can't control whether they do or don't. I -- if I'm understanding your argument correctly, you're saying that if Napier controls the design of -- and a locomotive part, that includes any design defect that's encompassed by State law, whether it's design in its traditional sense or failure to warn? That's basically what the court below said? Just as a practical matter, I'm assuming that some railroad repair yards are owned by the railroad itself, so the railroad repair people are railroad employees, correct? Are there some that are not? They are not considered railroad employees but they are considered something else? Just to be -- just to be clear, under your view of the LIA there could be other laws that preempt it or prohibit it? States can tell railroad yards put signs up, wear protective equipment, do whatever it is to protect the worker from this repair.

2011,Golan v. Holder,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, there was no limit here, meaning these foreign works were never given the opportunity to be copyrighted. Isn't that a substantial difference from the hypothetical that you're trying to proffer? You're -- the hypothetical -- and I think that's what Justice Ginsburg was responding to -- is you had a copyright, it expired, and now Congress wants to revive it. Isn't that different from not having had the opportunity at all, and being given a term to exploit your work and protect it? The problem-- --I -- I know, but it didn't do it when it set up the copyright system. In 1790, counsel, there were three States that didn't give copyrights. There were other States, and you make a big deal in your brief about common law protection, but common law protection, particularly in New York, which you relied on, only extended to unpublished works. Once a work was published, it was no longer protected under the common law. That was true of most States. And some States gave copyright protection to residents of their own State but not to residents from other States. So it took a whole body of public works and gave them copyright protection the day they decided to pass the copyright law. So what are you doing telling us that there has never been a historical experience with Congress taking public works out of the public domain? Read those words to me? You have to have a-- --Your reading of that passage is different than mine. I think it's a -- it's saying whether you have or you haven't. If we disagree with your proposition, does your argument fail? If the historical work does not point to what you claim? In 1790. If Congress did what I believe it did, would your argument fail? --it started in the place you want Congress to have started now. It said, moving forward, there is a Federal copyright. It didn't have to take things out of the public domain. We are arguing about whether they did or didn't. But assuming they did. You don't think that there are some foreign authors who didn't or wouldn't come into the U.S. market because they couldn't protect their works here, and kept their works in other markets that -- in which it was protected? And it doesn't encourage them to sort of make investments? Why not? Foreign authors who decided not to exploit their works here wouldn't be induced to think about coming into this market because now they can protect their works? You're -- you're not answering my question. You don't think that this law induces those foreign authors to come here and promote their work? Counsel, it might be his incentive to buy it or not, but the question is the author's incentive to sell it here. Those are two different incentives. Whether -- you know, he could go anywhere and buy a cheaper book if he chose to take the trip or get on the internet and find it. He could do that now. Copyrighted materials here go at a different price than they do elsewhere. That's not the issue. The issue is the author's incentive. Well, if you can't incentivize them, they are not going to claim their rights. They are not going to come and claim their rights. Part of this law is that they have to declare that they are interested in protecting their copyright here. Optional for them; but if they do, that's when they can sue a prior user. What's the limit that you're referring to? You said there are limits. What-- --Marbury -- the Davis law was passed. Had to go and pick out all the books it had that were subject to copyright and throw them out, or do what with them? Stop them from circulation? I'm not sure -- how would they protect themselves from infringement?

2011,Martinez v. Ryan,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"How does this work now, counsel? How are you proposing this work? Right now in the Federal system a pro se litigant comes in and says: I have an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Most district courts say, ask the attorney to submit an affidavit, and then decides whether on the face of the claims there is reason to appoint counsel and hold a hearing. Under your theory, every State would be obligated to appoint counsel ab initio to check out whether there is the potential for an <IAC> [= IAC] claim? So what you are essentially saying, every State is obligated to appoint an attorney on the first leg? Counsel, there is a huge reliance interest that has developed since Finley and its progeny, and States don't routinely appoint post-conviction counsel. What are we going to do about that reliance interest and the burdens on States? Well, I know -- I know for a fact that most do in capital cases. But I don't know if that's the same figure for non-capital cases. Well, it's only a cost if that second counsel, however its secured, can actually make a credible or sustainable claim that appellate counsel, the first tier counsel, was ineffective. Federal courts handle them routinely. Federal courts handle them routinely on papers, and most of them are denied. Is the State system different? Where first level counsel, appellate counsel, post-conviction counsel raises ineffective assistance of trial counsel. How many of those cases end up in hearing? Exactly. Very few. Can I go back to just clarify the record for a second? What authorized Levitt to file the post-conviction relief motion? Wasn't he appointed simply to prosecute the direct appeal? What gave him the authority to file the 32 motion? Obviously, he didn't seek his client's approval because the client when he received it said: I don't understand what you are saying; I only speak Spanish. So what gave Levitt the authority to do what she did? By an attorney appointed just on the direct review? So what would have been -- what was the tactical advantage of doing what she did? What conceivable reason was there for her to file the rule 32 motion before direct review finished? Well, you know that she didn't. So answer my question. What reason did Levitt have, strategic or otherwise, to file the rule 32 motion? But she files essentially an Ander's brief that says: I don't see anything. What was the strategic reason for doing that? What conceivable strategic reason? You mean -- that makes no sense to me. That happens quite frequently on direct appeal where a variety of issues are raised and the court -- the circuit court or the appellate courts send it back to trial counsel to develop the record further. Your position is every time there is a sending back, that stops the need for effective counsel? 47 States and the Federal Government does? What you haven't told me is a reason why he shouldn't have had effective counsel in the first post-conviction proceeding? I mean, our entire line of cases under Douglas were premised on the fact that defendants would not be or couldn't be charged with the ability to prosecute their claims through direct appeal. Discretionary appeal, we said the likelihood is they could do it on discretionary appeal because they would have a record from below, they would have competent counsel below who would make the best arguments possible, they could then pursue their discretionary appeals because they had something to work with. But if your first chance is to present ineffective assistance of counsel claim is a post-conviction proceeding, you have no record to work with. You have now told me that the vast majority of States, 47 I think is the number you gave -- put this into post conviction, give counsel at post-conviction review. Isn't it an empty promise if what you are giving is incompetent counsel? I mean, Strickland is a very high standard.

2011,Southern Union Company v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"You have no inducement to-- --Mr. Phillips, can you deal with one policy argument that your adversary raised that gives me some pause? And that is, the number of days is certainly something that the jury here could relatively easily decided upon. It could have looked at the evidence and figured that out, okay? But in fraud cases, in securities cases, sometimes the identity of victims is not determined for months, till months after the conviction, and the amount of fine and/or restitution is set at sentencing. What's going to happen to all of those statutes-- --because -- or all of those procedures that have been set up by Congress to sort of set the amount of loss and repayment? Are all of those subject to the Apprendi rule? Well, isn't -- aren't fines indeterminate here by definition, going back to Justice Kagan's question? There is no upper limit to how much the fine could be here, set -- the upper limit is set by the number of days, but why is it different? Why is restitution-- --Well, so, so-- --So how about when a fine is set by the value of the loss? That's no different than restitution. Congress permitted in 1790 indeterminate sentences as well, with no statutory maximum. So they did both-- --With respect to fines-- I'm not sure how you can fully make that argument, because I thought the history was set forth fairly clearly in Apprendi that the early history was that nothing was given to the jury with respect to imprisonment or fines because most if not all sentences were indeterminate. It's only when States began and the Federal government to experiment with determinate sentences that the Apprendi issue then became live. So explain to me, other than your reliance on Ice, some sort of tradition, which, you know, we can debate whether you can draw any conclusion from tradition in any of these areas, whether it's imprisonment or fines. Tell me on the logic of Apprendi, not using Ice, why fines are different, without relying on history which to me is -- I view it as ambiguous, okay? I thought it was fairly simple algorithm. It says if the statutory penalty -- if a judge's fact finding can increase the statutory penalty, then that's a violation of the Sixth Amendment. A jury has to find any fact that increases the statutory maximum. So outside of an imprisonment, there is no other penalty that Congress could fashion because it has no history that wouldn't be within the purview of the judge? What makes acceptable common law? Let's assume there weren't 50 states back then, but whatever the number was, 20 states, and 15 of them submitted it to the jury and 5 didn't. Does that mean there was no common law that this was generally submitted to the jury? If you can point to one case, that's enough to defeat the existence of a common law view? That -- you see, that's my problem. But so was imprisonment. Well, how many statutes had anything but indeterminate fine structures? How many statutes in the early common law had anything but indeterminate fine statutes? I may have just forgotten, but does your brief go through the status of what lower courts have decided with respect to fines and how they're dealing with them? I just don't remember it as being part of your brief, the statement you just made-- --Okay.

2011,Knox v. Service Employees International Union,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Could I ask you a question about the merits? Are you attacking the normal system of basing assessments moving forward, based on past accounting and chargeability and non-chargeability? Or are you just attacking the special assessment? All right. So articulate for me -- what's -- borrowing a phrase from one of my colleagues yesterday, how do we write this opinion? When is a second Hudson notice required? Let's presume for the sake of argument that the union had cost overruns. Labor salaries went up; printing costs went up, not for lobbying; but generally there was a 10 percent increase in their expenses across the board because various contracts that they were involved in required it. Would you require a second notice in that circumstance? Articulate that again? A material change-- --Can they take the money that they collected? Can they take the money that they collected under the first notice and, instead of doing a special assessment, in the middle of it this campaign gets announced by the governor, and can they then divert the chargeable amount that they have predicted and spend it on the non-chargeable amount? Or are you -- or does that require a second Hudson notice, without a special assessment? The problem is in this system, going back to Justice Breyer's practicality, they will get a chance to object; it just won't be at the moment of the special assessment; it will be the following year. So when the union gives its new notice, it's going to set forth its chargeable and non-chargeable amounts as audited, and it will say, as it did -- as it's done in the briefs before us: On Proposition 76 we are going to take 50 percent as chargeable. And the union members can come in and give a Lehnert objection, those who want to. Those who don't know it's happened and they agree to it. Isn't that correct? They do get a chance to object; the question is the timing. Is there an answer to that? They will get a chance to object then? But that's true of the first example I gave you. If something happens in the middle of the year and the union needs to divert already-assessed funds to challenge a election, they can do it and you said that's okay. But going back to the -- forget about special assessments. I think in one of the briefs, I know in one of the briefs, someone says: Elections happen every 4 years, so in the normal cycle of union activities in an election year they are going to divert more of whatever accessible moneys they have to their lobbying efforts and the following year they will go back to normal for 3 years. You're not challenging that normal variation in the -- in the distribution of the moneys, correct? So I guess my problem is I don't see how that, given your argument, is any less alone than this special assessment where the labor -- where the objecting members at the end of the year will get notice of what has happened that year, will have an opportunity to place their Lehnert challenges and get them ruled upon, and will, as Justice Breyer said, have a benefit because they are going to either pay more if the Lehnert -- pay less if the Lehnert challenges are upheld or pay more if -- if they're not. But I'm not quite sure how this is a different loan. Can I clarify a point? I thought I heard and maybe I just didn't look at the union regulations, the new ones. Is it limited to 180 days? I thought I heard your adversary say that the-- --I see. Could you tell me what the burden is on the union to give a second Hudson notice whenever there is a special assessment? Meaning do you happen to know how frequently unions impose special assessments and what the incremental cost is to the union of giving such notice? Try to summarize it. I wasn't looking to monopolize you. And a footnote. And it happens a lot, how burdensome is it? Could you please answer my question? All right. The burden. But they don't lose it; they're going to do it the following September. The attractive part of your argument from the beginning was that this is somehow a forced loan. And I understand the attractiveness of that. But it goes back to what Justice Breyer said from the beginning, which is, given -- as has been recognized, that money is fungible, and that you can't really often predict what's going to happen in the future, it's been developed a system that cyclically gets money to the people back. The problem is that I am being told by your adversary, and since we don't know, I'm always afraid of writing a decision in a vacuum, okay? That union structure, their business in a myriad number of ways, that some have a very small due each year, and a larger special assessment for special projects. And I assume there's endless variety. You're proposing a rule that every single time an assessment outside of annual dues is imposed, that a new Hudson notice can be given. And you're suggesting Justice Scalia, that all they have to say is we think it's going to be for chargeable effect. ",could i ask you a question about the merit be you attack the normal system of base assessment move forward base on past accounting and chargeability and non chargeability or be you just attack the special assessment all right so articulate for me what be borrow a phrase from one of my colleague yesterday how do we write this opinion when be a second hudson notice require let us presume for the sake of argument that the union have cost overrun labor salary go up printing cost go up not for lobby but generally there be a percent increase in their expense across the board because various contract that they we be involve in require it would you require a second notice in that circumstance articulate that again a material change can they take the money that they collect can they take the money that they collect under the first notice and instead of do a special assessment in the middle of it this campaign get announce by the governor and can they then divert the chargeable amount that they have predict and spend it on the non chargeable amount or be you or do that require a second hudson notice without a special assessment the problem be in this system go back to justice breyer s practicality they will get a chance to object it just will not be at the moment of the special assessment it will be the following year so when the union give its new notice it be go to set forth its chargeable and non chargeable amount as audit and it will say as it do as it be do in the brief before us on proposition we be go to take percent as chargeable and the union member can come in and give a lehnert objection those who want to those who do not know it be happen and they agree to it be not that correct they do get a chance to object the question be the timing be there an answer to that they will get a chance to object then but that be true of the first example i give you if something happen in the middle of the year and the union need to divert already assessed fund to challenge a election they can do it and you say that be okay but go back to the forget about special assessment i think in one of the brief i know in one of the brief someone say election happen every year so in the normal cycle of union activity in an election year they be go to divert more of whatever accessible money they have to their lobbying effort and the following year they will go back to normal for year you be not challenge that normal variation in the in the distribution of the money correct so i guess my problem be i do not see how that give your argument be any less alone than this special assessment where the labor where the object member at the end of the year will get notice of what have happen that year will have an opportunity to place their lehnert challenge and get them rule upon and will as justice breyer say have a benefit because they be go to either pay more if the lehnert pay less if the lehnert challenge be upheld or pay more if if they be not but I be not quite sure how this be a different loan can i clarify a point i think i hear and maybe i just do not look at the union regulation the new one be it limit to day i think i hear your adversary say that the i see could you tell me what the burden be on the union to give a second hudson notice whenever there be a special assessment mean do you happen to know how frequently union impose special assessment and what the incremental cost be to the union of give such notice try to summarize it i be not look to monopolize you and a footnote and it happen a lot how burdensome be it could you please answer my question all right the burden but they do not lose it they be go to do it the following september the attractive part of your argument from the beginning be that this be somehow a forced loan and i understand the attractiveness of that but it go back to what justice breyer say from the beginning which be give as have be recognize that money be fungible and that you can not really often predict what be go to happen in the future it be be develop a system that cyclically get money to the people back the problem be that i be be tell by your adversary and since we do not know I be always afraid of write a decision in a vacuum okay that union structure their business in a myriad number of way that some have a very small due each year and a large special assessment for special project and i assume there be endless variety you be propose a rule that every single time an assessment outside of annual due be impose that a new hudson notice can be give and you be suggest justice scalia that all they have to say be we think it be go to be for chargeable effect ,393.14,Roberts Court,"Jan 10, 2012","Dianne Knox, et al.","Service Employees International Union, Local 1000",10-1121,"Jun 27, 2011","Jun 21, 2012",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

2011,Roberts v. Sea-Land Services,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, would Justice Scalia's reading in your judgment -- accept his proposition that those currently receiving voluntary payments from the employer fall under subsection (c). Would his reading require the employer every year to recalculate the benefits to the maximum that's established that year? And that's why his reading-- --The function of (b) is to set a maximum that will control all payments present and future. And so if you read it the way he does, that maximum would change each year. Counsel, so what happens to your argument if we disagree with you that employers have a way to seek a compensation order? As I read the regulations, the only way they can do that is if the employee files a claim, and the employee's filing of the claim then sets the process in motion. I can't imagine that any employee, knowing that a future award could help them, would bother filing a claim to help the employer lock in his rate. That's not my question. Most of your argument is premised on the -- I thought, that the employer could lock in his rate-- --by seeking an award. If I disagree with you that the Act doesn't provide for that and neither do the regulations, that only employees can seek awards, what happens to your argument? As I've studied it, I think that's the case. Assume that fact to be true, that employers have no regulatory or statutory right to seek an award. They can either stop paying and have the employee make a claim or not. How -- what does this do to your argument, if that's accurate? By stopping payment. So that destroys the whole voluntary payment aspect. That's an odd statute. Mr. Gillelan, could I just-- What page are you on? And his answer to that was -- his answer to that was that the provision also permits an entry after someone -- of an order after someone dies. So it's -- the incongruity is taken care of by the act directly. Your brief -- your brief seem to use the newly awarded compensation, your meaning of it, at the time of injury, at the time of disability, the time of entitlement to compensation; and it seems to use those terms interchangeably. What term are you settling on and why? Counsel, let's assume an employer pays, continues to pay over a period of time, and the employee needs more money and goes in and says ""you owe me more money; I'm going to make a claim. "" The board says, ""no, he doesn't owe you more money. "" ""He was paying the right amount. "" And so you're not entitled to the 1200 you're asking for; you're only entitled to the 1000 he was paying. Under your view, if that happened 5 or 10 years after the payments started, would the employer be liable for the higher average 10 years later? Assuming it does, that the answer is yes? So what stops an employee from simply doing what I said? What stops an employee from kicking up his own maximum by -- whenever he chooses to do it, years and years later? If we find any ambiguity in the statute, in the statutory language, would it then make more sense to adopt your meaning or the government's, given all of the factors that the government argues counsels in its favor? Assume that-- ",counsel would justice scalia s reading in your judgment accept his proposition that those currently receive voluntary payment from the employer fall under subsection c would his reading require the employer every year to recalculate the benefit to the maximum that be establish that year and that be why his reading the function of b be to set a maximum that will control all payment present and future and so if you read it the way he do that maximum would change each year counsel so what happen to your argument if we disagree with you that employer have a way to seek a compensation order as i read the regulation the only way they can do that be if the employee file a claim and the employee s filing of the claim then set the process in motion i can not imagine that any employee know that a future award could help them would bother file a claim to help the employer lock in his rate that be not my question most of your argument be premise on the i think that the employer could lock in his rate by seek an award if i disagree with you that the act do not provide for that and neither do the regulation that only employee can seek award what happen to your argument as I have study it i think that be the case assume that fact to be true that employer have no regulatory or statutory right to seek an award they can either stop pay and have the employee make a claim or not how what do this do to your argument if that be accurate by stop payment so that destroy the whole voluntary payment aspect that be an odd statute mr gillelan could i just what page be you on and his answer to that be his answer to that be that the provision also permit an entry after someone of an order after someone dy so it be the incongruity be take care of by the act directly your brief your brief seem to use the newly award compensation your meaning of it at the time of injury at the time of disability the time of entitlement to compensation and it seem to use those term interchangeably what term be you settle on and why counsel let us assume an employer pay continue to pay over a period of time and the employee need more money and go in and say you owe me more money I be go to make a claim the board say no he do not owe you more money he be pay the right amount and so you be not entitle to the you be ask for you be only entitle to the he be pay under your view if that happen or year after the payment start would the employer be liable for the high average year later assume it do that the answer be yes so what stop an employee from simply do what i say what stop an employee from kick up his own maximum by whenever he choose to do it year and year later if we find any ambiguity in the statute in the statutory language would it then make more sense to adopt your meaning or the government s give all of the factor that the government argue counsel in its favor assume that ,237.77000000000004,Roberts Court,"Jan 11, 2012",Dana Roberts,"Sea-Land Services, Inc., et al.",10-1399,"Sep 27, 2011","Mar 20, 2012",113.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2011,Holder v. Gutierrez,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"But did it make that determination as a legal matter or as an exercise of its discretion? As I read its opinion, it felt that it had to come to that conclusion as a matter of law. If we were to find-- --the statute ambiguous, where has it explained its policy decisions independent of its legal conclusions? Assuming we don't accept Respondent's, what appears to be their argument, that being an LPR is not a requirement of the statute, if we assume that being an LPR is what triggers the availability for the Attorney General's exercise of discretion, how does that -- how does the imputation rule harm the statute? The child has lived with the parents for 5 years, whether before or after -- well, after it wouldn't be an issue, but before the grant of LPR status. How does that harm the purposes of the statute? I thought the idea of the statute was to give individuals who had ties to the United States an opportunity to stay. If a child's been with their parents for 5, 10, 15 years, what sense does it make to deprive them of the Attorney General's exercise of discretion merely because the administrative process has taken too long to give them something which they are going to get and which they've gotten? So why is a parent's fraudulent conduct imputed to a child? There's no intent there. The child obviously doesn't have an intent or couldn't have an intent to commit a crime. So why is that imputed by the BIA, other than that it's a holding against the immigrant, which your adversary points out is not a very favorable outlook for the agency, it only imputes when it harms the immigrant. But putting that aside, there is no intent involved in the fraud. It's just the commission of an act. What's the state of mind of committing an act, like a fraudulent act? The child doesn't commit a fraudulent act. One of the problems that I have is that I see the imputation as an equitable doctrine. And to me that often means discretionary. If it is that, discretionary, I -- I don't know what more the BIA has to say than 1229b(a)(2). Isn't that an end run on stopping this continuous 7-year statute, or 10, whatever it is, if we are imputing a parent's residence, or any of the things that you are -- that the government said, the BIA said, in rendering its decision? I mean, you can't force a court to impute -- the BIA to impute. So what more do they have to say than: We don't think it's consistent with the statute, even if it is ambiguous to do this? What is so reasonable about a child who lives with their grandparents outside the country? Why should their parents being in the U.S. be imputed to the benefit of that child? I certainly understand it in your client's situation. Your client is the one who has been here since 5 years old. So-- Just for factual correction, the record doesn't tell us whether he was living with his mother, Mr. Sawyers was living with his mother. And the answer to that is? Is this is child living with a grandparent out of the country or not? Counsel, that's a very big assumption. Yes, it's the two biggest circuits who have defined domicile and imputation, but it wasn't us, number 1. And number 2, going back to Justice Alito's question, they didn't adopt the same word, ""domicile"", they changed it. And that's what the BIA was saying.

You don't see any reliance by the government on the truthful statements there, and its collection of taxes? So it also had to prove that the government relied? Is that what you are saying? I'm -- I'm not even sure why, because under tax evasion you can be charged with tax evasion merely for avoiding the payment of tax. You don't have to make a statement at all.

2011,Vasquez v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Could you tell me what the error actually was? I see -- and you can add another -- three potential things about these calls or three potential errors: One, that they proved as a matter of fact that she was biased. But, as the majority points out, she already said she was before the tapes were played. So whatever error may have been occasioned by the jury using the tapes as for the truth, it really was cumulative to an already admitted bias. The second is some sort of ambiguous statement by her that all of them were in trouble, meaning all the defendants, and a similar statement by the Petitioner's lawyer. So what was it that was error that affected or influenced the jury among these three choices? It was never referenced in the summations, however, or in the reply. So that's the error that you think-- --influenced this trial? All right. Now, tell me what in this record reflects that influence. The fact that they asked for her testimony, well, she was your client's entire defense. So what does the asking for her testimony show that they were interested in that particular part of the transcript? Which transcript? The transcript of her testimony? Can we get a little more practical here? I think I understood your basic argument, which is: My defense was by this one woman, the wife of one of the codefendants. She tells a story and if the jury had believed her story they would have acquitted your client. All right. So I am assuming what you're saying -- and you can correct me if I'm wrong -- which is if we believe that the error committed affected her credibility in a meaningful way, that that deprived you of a defense. Is that what you're saying? Of the potential of convincing the jury. Now, assuming that's your argument, I go back to my question, okay. Because what you said to me earlier, it wasn't about believing her or not; it was about believing the defense attorney when -- whether the defense attorney thought the defendant was guilty or not. Let's -- let's-- --Are you taking the position in this case that a reviewing court under no circumstance could conclude that this error was harmless? Or are you taking the position in this case that the court here, the Seventh Circuit, I think, committed review error and we should send it back for them to do it the right way? I don't know how to separate out an admitted error situation. And let me explain why, okay? Let's assume the facts of this case, but instead of this tape recording the improperly admitted evidence was a confession by the defendant. Would you be prepared to say that in a circumstantial case of guilt -- now, we've already said that confessions are one of the most powerful pieces of harmful error -- that in this, in a confession, that somehow this was still harmful -- harmless? Yes. That's a different standard. Let's, let's talk about it under the Kehoda standard. Let's talk about the standard we are assessing. No, no, no. He testifies, but he testifies to everything Marina said. Meaning, he -- when I used the word ""confession"", I'm sorry, I misspoke. He takes the stand. He -- or doesn't take the stand. He says everything he said to the police. And that confession that he was there-- --She called him, etcetera. It was improperly admitted, without Miranda warning. Not the tapes, just the story. All right. My hypothetical is not working for this reason, and I understand what you are saying. It's hard to identify a comparable mistake. But my point is that -- doesn't the harmfulness of the error sort of vary with the strength of the government's case. If he had not run away, and the tapes were admitted-- --Exactly. And what the defense said was -- there is only one defense here, and it's the wife's defense that he was there by accident, not intentionally. There was a lot of countervailing evidence to disprove that, but the question is could a reasonable jury have -- might have or could have credited that defense? Sure. You look at how the case was tried. Counsel, I just don't see how you can do it without the error. I keep going back to this point. How about if the prosecutor had done in summation the following: Ladies and Gentlemen, whatever the wife told you disbelieve because the lawyer said he was guilty. The lawyer -- the prosecutor got up at the end of trial and said: Disbelieve everything the wife told you, because the lawyer said the defendant was guilty. All right? I'll go through all the other evidence I have that might prove that she was not telling the truth, but the central, most important piece of evidence in this case about his guilt is that the lawyer said he's guilty. Can you say that this jury was uninfluenced by that error? Because under your formulation-- --A rational jury would have convicted absent the lawyer saying that. The dissent pointed out that she admitted that before the tapes were played. That she was testifying in the hopes of getting a lesser sentence for her husband. So she -- the tapes weren't necessary for that. What was your second-- ",could you tell me what the error actually be i see and you can add another three potential thing about these call or three potential error one that they prove as a matter of fact that she be bias but as the majority point out she already say she be before the tape we be play so whatever error may have be occasion by the jury use the tape as for the truth it really be cumulative to an already admit bias the second be some sort of ambiguous statement by her that all of them we be in trouble mean all the defendant and a similar statement by the petitioner s lawyer so what be it that be error that affect or influence the jury among these three choice it be never reference in the summation however or in the reply so that be the error that you think influence this trial all right now tell me what in this record reflect that influence the fact that they ask for her testimony well she be your client s entire defense so what do the ask for her testimony show that they we be interested in that particular part of the transcript which transcript the transcript of her testimony can we get a little more practical here i think i understand your basic argument which be my defense be by this one woman the wife of one of the codefendant she tell a story and if the jury have believe her story they would have acquit your client all right so i be assume what you be say and you can correct me if I be wrong which be if we believe that the error commit affect her credibility in a meaningful way that that deprive you of a defense be that what you be say of the potential of convince the jury now assume that be your argument i go back to my question okay because what you say to me early it be not about believe her or not it be about believe the defense attorney when whether the defense attorney think the defendant be guilty or not let us let us be you take the position in this case that a review court under no circumstance could conclude that this error be harmless or be you take the position in this case that the court here the seventh circuit i think commit review error and we should send it back for them to do it the right way i do not know how to separate out an admitted error situation and let me explain why okay let us assume the fact of this case but instead of this tape record the improperly admit evidence be a confession by the defendant would you be prepare to say that in a circumstantial case of guilt now we have already say that confession be one of the most powerful piece of harmful error that in this in a confession that somehow this be still harmful harmless yes that be a different standard let us let us talk about it under the kehoda standard let us talk about the standard we be assess no no no he testify but he testify to everything marina say meaning he when i use the word confession I be sorry i misspoke he take the stand he or do not take the stand he say everything he say to the police and that confession that he be there she call him etcetera it be improperly admit without miranda warning not the tape just the story all right my hypothetical be not work for this reason and i understand what you be say it be hard to identify a comparable mistake but my point be that do not the harmfulness of the error sort of vary with the strength of the government s case if he have not run away and the tape we be admit exactly and what the defense say be there be only one defense here and it be the wife s defense that he be there by accident not intentionally there be a lot of countervail evidence to disprove that but the question be could a reasonable jury have might have or could have credit that defense sure you look at how the case be try counsel i just do not see how you can do it without the error i keep go back to this point how about if the prosecutor have do in summation the following lady and gentleman whatever the wife tell you disbelieve because the lawyer say he be guilty the lawyer the prosecutor get up at the end of trial and say disbelieve everything the wife tell you because the lawyer say the defendant be guilty all right I will go through all the other evidence i have that might prove that she be not tell the truth but the central most important piece of evidence in this case about his guilt be that the lawyer say he be guilty can you say that this jury be uninfluenced by that error because under your formulation a rational jury would have convict absent the lawyer say that the dissent point out that she admit that before the tape we be play that she be testify in the hope of get a less sentence for her husband so she the tape be not necessary for that what be your second ,383.61000000000007,Roberts Court,"Mar 21, 2012",Alexander Vasquez,United States,11-199,"Nov 28, 2011","Apr 2, 2012",113.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2011,Kappos v. Hyatt,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I thought that -- it's interesting that the language of Morgan and one of its companion cases, not companion in the sense of being heard at the same time, but on the same issue -- the Radio City case -- both of them don't talk in the language of today. They don't talk about deference, they don't talk about substantial evidence. They talk about whether the PTO has expertise, and presumptions that their fact findings based on their expertise have to be overcome with some convincing evidence. So they are talking in different language, but the concept they are talking about is one where the Court does accept findings of the PTO on the matters that involve their expertise, and give them weight -- substantial weight, essentially. And only overturn it if the Court is, in the words of Morgan and Radio City, ""thoroughly convinced"" that they were wrong. So what's wrong with that standard? Everybody likes the deference language of today, but they were very clear in what they were saying: If the PTO made a finding, you decide whether that finding was based on its expertise, and if it was, you don't change it, court, unless you are thoroughly convinced they were wrong. Is there anything wrong with that? With that articulation of what the standard should be in all situations, whether there is new evidence or no new evidence? Let me tell you what my problem is with this case. It is the issue that Verizon raised, and the lack of connection between the district court's holding and the circuits court holding. The district court excluded the affidavit for the proposed arguments on the basis of them being new arguments that board rules precluded them from raising at the stage they did. The circuit court described the affidavit as new evidence. And the Verizon amicus brief says: Court, be careful, because it's not really clear what's new evidence in this affidavit and what's new argument. And that question troubles me, for the following reason: Verizon posits that the issue of whether a description is specific enough is a legal question to which the PTO is not entitled to deference. Why, other than Federal Circuit and Patent Board precedent, is that right? And can you explain why this affidavit that was rejected is in fact new evidence and not merely new argument? Could you tell me what -- other than it's in the form of an affidavit, tell me what in the content was new evidence? I want to get away from the labels and I want to get to the substance, because I've looked at all of these submissions and it sounds like what I read in the briefs every day. But I'm not sure-- --But I don't know that that -- I think you're confusing the nature of the review, which is de novo, new, with the burdens that attach to the proof. Those are two different concepts. And so that's what Microsoft said. Don't confuse burdens with standards of review. That it's de novo review is one thing, but even in de novo review we often give more weight or presumptive weight to some facts as opposed to others. And that's what I think Morgan was talking about. Morgan was very clear: Whether it was new evidence or not, you give -- you accept as valid whatever the PTO does, and you require to be thoroughly convinced by new evidence or not that they were wrong. I don't know why that standard can't apply in any situation. I think that's what Judge Newman intended, although he didn't say that. So why are we confusing the standard of review with the burden? I have two problems with your argument. The first is, and I know that it may be unique to me because many of my colleagues say that you don't rely on legislative history. But I'm not relying just on legislative history. I'm relying that the legislative history is replete with the commissioner of patents himself saying that section 145 required de novo review. And witness after witness tried to argue for Congress to change it, and it didn't, arguing that it required de novo review. Second, our cases repeatedly describe it as de novo review. So you got to get past that. And then you got to get past that between 1927 and 1945 you have Barrett on your side. But there are plenty of courts, including the Second Circuit, and a very respected jurist, Learned Hand, saying that if you exclude new evidence it should only be if it's on principles of estoppel, that someone intentionally withheld evidence from the PTO. So how do you deal with a record that doesn't basic -- that doesn't support your basic argument? So give us a standard and how what -- the good cause that you are somehow willing to accept different from the government's reasonable cause standard? And equity seems to have required an intentional or bad faith withholding, is that what you want to limit yourself to? What do you do with sort of the -- the in between. The intentional and the grossly negligent. And what do you see the limits of that estoppel principal -- equity principal? I think that's what Justice Breyer was really -- was referring to. What would be the contours of your equity limits? That's a little bit unfair, to characterize the cases as limited to that. Some talked about negligence. And some courts said it should be intentional. There was a debate back and forth. Yes, I agree. It seems to me you were introducing such a gamesmanship. Anybody who wanted to get out of substantial deference under the APA just has to present an expert. That's -- that's what makes little sense to me, trying to -- now we are hair-splitting in a very minute way. Articulate a standard that would -- no one is suggesting total de novo review with no deference to any kind of presumption applied to the PTO decision. Another way to look at it-- --is the way that I suggested, which is it doesn't matter if there is no new evidence or not; what is the level of respect that you are going to give to the PTO factual findings? Be -- as the language of Morgan, be convinced that the PTO was wrong? But why doesn't the Court just say what you said. If it's -- not the Court, Congress -- if you admit that Congress intended a section 145 action to permit new evidence, if it wanted to limit that evidence to something that could not have been found with due diligence or whatever your limitations are, why did it speak more broadly? I mean, the statutory language suggests as PTO. As law -- ""as equity might permit"". This is very broad language. ",i think that it be interest that the language of morgan and one of its companion case not companion in the sense of be hear at the same time but on the same issue the radio city case both of them do not talk in the language of today they do not talk about deference they do not talk about substantial evidence they talk about whether the pto have expertise and presumption that their fact finding

2011,"Freeman v. Quicken Loans, Inc.",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, under your reading, as I understand it, the words ""portion, split or percentage"" means an amount less than the whole? So what happens if a service provider gives 100 percent to the other side, as opposed to an amount less than the whole? Does that make much sense, that if you give one meaning -- if you stay consistent with your meaning, what you are saying is a situation where the service provider gives away everything, 100 percent, they are just not liable under (b); if they give away 1 percent, they are -- if they keep 1 percent, they are liable? Is -- is -- is there -- Judge Higginbotham, in his dissent, said there is a big difference between unearned fees and overcharge fees. He said unearned fees, in their simplest form, is no service whatsoever. Overcharges are some service, but an excessive value. What is wrong with that definition? Why is that definition unworkable in terms of limiting and defining this statute? You think not? How about with subsidiaries? Wasn't it common practice -- isn't it common practice that subsidiaries are often receiving parts of the payments because then they become -- they come out of the gross income of the major parent? So why isn't it a potential common practice that they are getting 100 percent of something they didn't do? If they are rendering -- if they are already rendering services? Counsel, if your reading of the language is not plain, if there are two ways to read this statute, give me your best reason for why the policy statement should not be given deference. I know you said because it didn't go through notice -- through notice; but outside of that, why isn't this a HUD interpretation that the statute tells us HUD can do, an interpretation of the statute. We can argue about whether it's an interpretation of Regulation X or not, but why wouldn't it be entitled to deference? The Second Circuit had said something a lot different, and HUD came back and invited HUD to do something, and HUD came back and said: You read it that way; we think this is a better reading. What more do we need from an agency? Counsel, I'm sorry. May I just correct you on that? Didn't HUD in that preamble say explicitly, ""The Secretary, charged by statute with interpreting RESPA, interprets 18(b) to mean that two persons are not required? "" It says that explicitly. Not in the policy statement; in the preamble to Regulation X. In, in 1996. I thought that was the final rulemaking you were talking about, because it didn't do rulemaking with respect to the policy statement. But I'm not sure. Congress didn't say that HUD could only give interpretations through rules. It said it could give rules, pass rules and regulations, and give interpretations. So what's the procedural defect in it just giving an interpretation? We go back to whether the policy -- whether the policy -- whether the statute is ambiguous or not. And what I'm trying to figure out is what's the deficiency in the policy statement that's independent of the ambiguity you rely upon. Well, it says it's longstanding for it-- --Counsel, I'm -- I'm a little confused. Under your interpretation or theirs, the Court gets involved in determining whether fees, services were rendered. I mean, it's not as if your interpretation is going to keep the Court out of that business. To be able to find a kickback, the Court has to determine whether services were rendered or not. So what's the difference in that inquiry when it involves a kickback and when it involves a single provider? In a kickback situation, the Court has to decide whether there was actually a service rendered that entitled the person to a percentage or not; correct? So what's the difference between deciding that question and deciding that the -- the one individual provided a service? And it listed, as Justice Ginsburg said, unearned fees. Why would it matter to Congress? Give me a reason that it would matter to Congress whether the unearned fee was by one person in a dual relationship or a single person alone? The issue was unearned fees. Rendering -- charging for a service you didn't render. That's what the whole kickback idea was about, correct? I'm sorry, could you go back to Justice Scalia's question? If a -- if a bank has an appraisal fee from the past and decides, I don't need a new one, but still charges you for an appraisal fee, would that violate the statute?

2011,Sackett v. EPA,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Who would review that and where? Going back to Justice Kagan's question of -- let's assume you went through an APA process and they found it was wetlands and that the compliance terms were -- had a substantial nexus. What happens when you go into an enforcement action? So does anything get estoppel? Does anything get estoppel? Assuming it's not a legal question, would the factual findings that there is a substantial nexus between the remedy ordered and the violation, would that get estoppel? You are conceding that the compliance order, assuming there is a violation, is all right? You are not challenging any of the terms of the compliance order other than the finding of a violation? But, Mr. Stewart-- --I'm sorry. Mr. Stewart-- --Counsel, but those situations are slightly different because the act doesn't specify any specific remedies that apply to any specific property. It just says: You violate the act by filling in wetlands. It doesn't say that you violate the act by not removing the fill and not planting trees and not doing this or doing that. What it says is: You violate the act if you don't comply with the compliance order that tells you to do those things. So it's a very theoretically violation that's going on. One is in the affirmative act prohibited by the statute; that's the violation of the statute. And the other is the violation of the remedial steps that the compliance order is the only thing that has set forth. But those are not in the statute. They are permitted by the statute, but they're not set forth as requirements under the statute. That has nothing to do with the fact that the act doesn't specifically tell you to remove it. --Could I ask you-- --Mr. Stewart -- I'm sorry, finish your answer. Your cut-off. You are saying if we were troubled by the additional penalties, and you were going to suggest something. If we were troubled by that aspect of the order alone and you haven't dealt with the permit issue after the fact, what would be your approach to the case then? But you're required to make a finding that there's a violation. You're not suggesting that the government is going to act willy-nilly and not going to act on sufficient evidence in just -- in sending a letter that says ""we find you are violating the act.

2011,Howes v. Fields,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Don't you think being in custody itself is a circumstance? What's all this ""all-circumstances mix? "" ""I thought that our case law was fairly clear that all circumstances is a test for voluntariness. "" ""I thought the issue has always been under Miranda: Is the person free to go or not? "" So since when have we imported of the language of voluntariness into the Miranda test? Should we be creating yet another test? So go to the test of freedom to leave. You're taken from your cell and locked into a room -- and let's change the facts-- --and locked in a room and said: Talk to me; you have to tell me what happened. Is that person free to go? All right. So what makes this case different? He's taken from a -- Except being told that he could leave. If he had been taken from his cell, removed from the prison, his normal setting, taken by armed guards to another building, and with guards at the door, sat down and told: Talk to us about this incident. Why would he think he was free to leave? There is one fact I'm taking out of it, which is that he was told he was free to go. As I see the record, he claims twice he said: I don't want to talk to you. And when he asked to leave at the end, it took 20 minutes, and they continued the questioning. Doesn't that counter the rest of what you are saying? The Chief asked you in his question which way does it cut, meaning you seem to be advocating a rule that says merely because he's in prison is irrelevant, standing alone. I think your adversary is saying you can't take out the fact that this person's liberty is restrained from the equation. So going back to my hypothetical, if you are forced to leave the prison, as this gentleman was, and put in another room, what presumption should you start with? Shouldn't the presumption be that if you are forced to go to another place that you are in custody? What -- what would make someone who is forced to go somewhere think that they are free to go back, absent being told? But what -- what would make any reasonable prisoner who can't move without an escort believe that they are always free to go back? Once they are forced to go from point A to point B. Well, going back to confusing coercion issues with custody issues, and -- I don't know that you have really answered Justice Breyer's question. Someone's picked off the street and told, you have to go into this room, and questions are asked. Wouldn't we assume that that person is in custody? Well, but he didn't choose to go in that room. He was placed in that room. What makes him think that if his jailers were walking him somewhere, that he was free to leave? The first Ohio court -- I'm sorry, the court below -- had its own -- seemingly had its own absolute rule, yet -- that if you are told you're free to go, that that breaks the chain of custody, whatever that might mean. Assuming -- and the Sixth Circuit said if you are removed from the prison and questioned, you -- you absolutely must be given warnings. Is there a middle ground, and what would that middle ground be?

2011,Gonzalez v. Thaler,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, before your time expires, I'd like to ask one question on the merits. In Jimenez, we held that the most natural reading of 2244(d)(1)(A) is to read it like we read 2255. And we read 2255 to say that finality is reached when direct review, and direct review concludes when the court affirms a conviction or denies a petition, or, if the defendant foregoes direct review, when the time for seeking such review expires. Isn't that what the Fifth Circuit did-- --with 22 -- with 2244? It read it exactly the way we read it in Jimenez? I know, but you're not taking its holding. You -- you take language from it. But I read -- I read Jimenez to say that the court should be reading this alternative ""or"" language in exactly the way the Fifth Circuit did. Jimenez held that it's an either/or. If you do direct review, you do it from the time that it's final, that it concludes; or if you've foregone direct review, when the time for seeking review expires. Counsel, are you accepting Justice Scalia's point that the certificate of appealability doesn't have to jurisdictionally describe the substantial constitutional issue? So you agreed with the question he posed to your adversary, that you are saying that this was deficient because both, it didn't indicate the issue, and because it didn't describe the substantial constitutional question? Put that to one side. Counsel, I'm a little confused, okay? And I think it's what Justice Ginsburg was trying to get at, and Justice Breyer, which is: What you are requiring in you're saying the statute requires, if for the district court to always reach the merits of any argument presented in a habeas petition, to figure out whether it's a substantial argument before it dismisses on a procedural ground. And that seems to be what you're, you're wanting to happen because a judge would have to say: I'm dismissing on a procedural ground and I believe that the claim is more than non-frivolous, that it has a substantial basis. Doesn't that speed the habeas process in the normal cases? I mean, in my experience, what district court judges do is find the easiest way to dismiss something. If the speedy trial ground is the easiest, they go that way. I'm sorry. If it's not and it's a procedural bar, they use a procedural bar. They don't create extra work for themselves. So what do we do then-- --What happens if it happens? Does that -- does that make any sense? Isn't it easier to read it -- the statute the way your adversary suggests, which would protect both the right to direct review and the right to collateral review? Do you have any idea of how much the jurisdictional question plagues the courts below? Meaning, is it -- is it so complicated that people below don't really know what district courts are granting COAs on? Do -- circuit courts don't understand what the issues are somehow by the opinion below? Circuit judge -- or circuit judge or judge. Yes. ",counsel before your time expire I have like to ask one question on the merit in jimenez we hold that the most natural reading of d a be to read it like we read and we read to say that finality be reach when direct review and direct review conclude when the court affirm a conviction or deny a petition or if the defendant foregoes direct review when the time for seek such review expires be not that what the fifth circuit do with with it read it exactly the way we read it in jimenez i know but you be not take its holding you you take language from it but i read i read jimenez to say that the court should be read this alternative or language in exactly the way the fifth circuit do jimenez hold that it be an eitheror if you do direct review you do it from the time that it be final that it conclude or if you have forego direct review when the time for seek review expire counsel be you accept justice scalia s point that the certificate of appealability do not have to jurisdictionally describe the substantial constitutional issue so you agree with the question he pose to your adversary that you be say that this be deficient because both it do not indicate the issue and because it do not describe the substantial constitutional question put that to one side counsel I be a little confused okay and i think it be what justice ginsburg be try to get at and justice breyer which be what you be require in you be say the statute require if for the district court to always reach the merit of any argument present in a habeas petition to figure out whether it be a substantial argument before it dismiss on a procedural ground and that seem to be what you be you be want to happen because a judge would have to say I be dismiss on a procedural ground and i believe that the claim be more than non frivolous that it have a substantial basis do not that speed the habeas process in the normal case i mean in my experience what district court judge do be find the easy way to dismiss something if the speedy trial ground be the easy they go that way I be sorry if it be not and it be a procedural bar they use a procedural bar they do not create extra work for themselves so what do we do then what happen if it happen do that do that make any sense be not it easy to read it the statute the way your adversary suggests which would protect both the right to direct review and the right to collateral review do you have any idea of how much the jurisdictional question plague the court below meaning be it be it so complicate that people below do not really know what district court be grant coas on do circuit court do not understand what the issue be somehow by the opinion below circuit judge or circuit judge or judge yes ,226.04,Roberts Court,"Nov 2, 2011",Rafael Arriaza Gonzalez,"Rick Thaler, Director, Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Correctional Institutions Division",10-895,"Jun 13, 2011","Jan 10, 2012",113.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2011,Salazar v. Ramah Navajo Chapter,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Excuse me, but could the Secretary have done anything else? Could the Secretary have done anything else? There's an allegation that the Secretary in fact pays some contractors more than their pro rata share, that it pays some nothing-- --so that it's in effect acting -- I don't want to use the word ""arbitrarily"" -- but acting in whatever its best interest is. So what protects the contracting party from that -- from that conduct, assuming it were to be correct? Says it has a policy. The allegation is, is that it's not following it, that it's choosing to pay people some more than others. Well, how -- what was our reference and acceptance of the Ferris doctrine? And the Ferris doctrine was almost identical to this situation, where Congress allotted a certain amount to the building of a particular dam, and the same -- we applied the Ferris principle and said even though they gave it to one type of contract, the dam, they were paying 1 percent less than others. Where they had an allotment adequate enough to cover that individual. I know what the Federal Circuit said. I don't think the Federal Circuit's right. If you read Ferris, there was an appropriation for the dam. So do the tribes have the right to stop providing the services-- --that they've contracted to? How do they know that until they know what they're getting? Meaning they don't know what they're getting. They signed a contract that says you're going to pay them for their services to their members and for their administrative costs. They incur that cost, and then at the end of the year, the government now says to them you've honored your part, but we're not going to honor ours. What does the system do to the 50-odd contracts that Arctic Slope, in its amici brief, points to that are similar to these? Does this now mean that moving forward, that every government contractor who has a ""subject to appropriations"" language takes the risk that at some point in the middle of the contract, the government is going to dishonor its obligation and pay it less than it said it would? So how do -- how do we differentiate those 50 other contracts? So why don't we let Congress fix it? Because there are so many ways that Congress could fix this problem directly. By doing a line item allocation, it could take away the obligation to enter into these contracts and fully fund. It could be much more direct-- --than it's being, given the interpretation that you're advancing. It was trying -- it was trying to tell the tribes, we are honoring our obligation by paying you the costs, but we are really not going to do it because we are going to let the government give you less? I have to assume Congress intends what it says. It intends to obligate you to enter into contracts that -- that give -- make you commit to paying their costs, correct? But that's true of every contract. That's where I'm getting stuck on what your theory is. The Anti-Deficiency Act says you can't spend more than you're given. So every single contractor, under your logic, should know that when they sign a contract, the government can break it because if it doesn't have enough funds, it can't pay. But -- so there's no real logic to your argument, other than to say we can't -- we're -- if the contract says ""subject to appropriations"", let's do away with Ferris, let's do away with Cherokee Nation and-- --it just means that we pay you what we can. But what you're saying is you make two promises on the ISDA. We're going to pay you your support costs, your administrative costs, in full, and we're going to retain the right to break that promise. That's really what you're saying the ISDA says. So you ignore all the language where it says we're going to pay you X amount, all the law that says you have to be reimbursed -- the tribes have to be reimbursed for all their costs; all of that is going to be ignored? Could you give me that cite again. Mr. Phillips, this is an unusual situation with the tribes because in the normal ""not to exceed"" appropriation by Congress, the government rightly says we have the power to not contract. And in military contracts and others, we have a for convenience cancellation. We have all sorts of things that protect us from the deficiency. But this is a unique situation because the government, on the one hand, despite their protestations to the contrary, are forced to accept these contracts. And on the other hand, Congress is saying, don't pay more on them. We are telling you to accept more payment than we are going to give you. Should we create a special rule for this -- why shouldn't we create a special rule for this unique situation? Mr. Phillips, how does Congress do this without upsetting the entire scheme? Knowing that these contracts are not all signed on one day, that there are 12 regions, that the negotiations go over time, how could Congress achieve the scheme that the government wants now? How would it write this contract? I'm sorry. You keep saying that, but I thought in your earlier answer you said that the contracts are generally signed by the time of the appropriation. Where is that in the cycle of performance? Is that at the beginning of performance? So the tribes -- even when the appropriation comes out, they don't know how much the Department has contracted with other tribes. So they're performing until they get that notice later on. Do you dispute Mr. Phillips' statement that the tribes don't know how much they're getting until some point further into the performance cycle? The system that's in place does not-- ",excuse me but could the secretary have do anything else could the secretary have do anything else there be an allegation that the secretary in fact pay some

2011,Setser v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, in the third sentence of this provision, on its face, does Mr. Setser fit into it? ""Multiple terms of imprisonment imposed at different times run consecutively. "" What is unclear about those words? The words are not unclear. We have to do the statutory interpretation that you want? Some fairly respected jurists below, Judge Easterbrook and Judge Fletcher, two different circuits, have read it as taking care of all those situations that the other two sentences don't cover. Why is that an irrational reading? But that assumes the answer, is what I'm saying to you. If you give each sentence its plain meaning, why is -- why is Mr. Setser not within the plain meaning of the third? He -- he had multiple terms of imprisonment, imposed at different times. But judicial review of what? Not of the -- not of whether that was the desire of the State court or not. Judicial review as to whether they abused their discretion? So you are going to make a bureaucrat equal to a judge in making the most important decision that a defendant faces: How much time he should spend in jail. So a bureaucrat rather than a judge decides whether he's going to tack on a year and a half, 5 or 10, or whether he's going to let the defendant serve it concurrently? It's not -- it's not a who or when, because the State court judge's recommendation is not binding on BOP. It has said repeatedly, hasn't it? Just answer that question. Hasn't BOP said that a State court recommendation is not binding on it? So it can't be just who -- it can't be just when. It's who's going to make the decision. But wasn't the SRA passed and this provision passed in part to take that decision away from the bureaucrat? Well, let's answer Justice Scalia's point. Wasn't the SRA passed in part because of the dissatisfaction with the fact that the parole board used to make this decision, and they wanted to put it back in the hands of judges? I don't know why it takes away from them on that score. They can choose whatever facility they want within the constraints imposed by a judge in terms of the length of the sentence. Mr. Jay-- --Mr. Jay, there is some force to your, to Petitioner's argument that federalism should be respected, that Federal courts -- the State judges and their individual wishes should be respected and followed by BOP actually. The system you're proposing actually takes away from both Federal judges control over the sentencing decision. If Federal judges recommend a consecutive sentence, then the State judge can take that into account in setting how much time they think is warranted for their crime in addition or different from, and the judge if he wants it to run concurrently the way Justice Breyer said, he could just give a zero. He knows what the Federal judge wants. The bottom line-- Mr. Young -- it becomes easier than that. The State court can't force the Federal Bureau of Prisons to take the prisoner back, correct? Exactly. And so all it can do is sentence the defendant to whatever time it's going to sentence the defendant. The defendant serves that time. Then the Federal sovereign takes over and does whatever the Federal judge said. Runs it consecutively or concurrently. Whatever the Federal judge said controls in every situation. So is there evidence one way or the other on that question, whether this situation was in any meaningful sense before the Congress? That's preferable, to clog the judicial system with untold number of Federal convictions that have not been reduced to judgment? That's preferable to giving judges, or recognizing their power to state their views up front? Could you tell me what facts would affect the sentence here? The judge here very clearly believed that some of the State charges overlapped and some didn't. And so it ran some consecutive to one set of State charges and concurrent to the other.

2011,Wood v. Milyard,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, we asked for two questions presented. The first was: Do court of appeals have the power sua sponte to raise issues? And in your reply brief you appear to say, yes, they do in some circumstances. So are you conceding that that power exists or that there is no power whatsoever? Is that a question of power or a question of exercise of discretion? That seems sort of strange. Both rely on a factual situation. Either you can do something or you can't. That's power. If you can do it sometimes, that's still power, and then the question is did you do it when you couldn't do it. So all this fight is about is whether there was a deliberate waiver or not? As opposed to power? Only the opportunity or when it acknowledges -- in Day we faulted the district court for not telling the State essentially, which -- not telling the State that it had a potential statute of limitations defense. Is it your position that if the State had just been silent about the statute of limitations defense and not raised it, that the court of appeals wouldn't have power? Or is it your position that because they knew they had the defense and didn't raise it that the court of appeals didn't have power to sua sponte raise it. You're not answering my question. Does the court of appeals have the power sua sponte to raise it if the state -- neither the court or the State addressed the issue? All right. So it doesn't have the power if the issue has been raised? Is that your position? I'm a little confused. You seem to be arguing that because the court of appeals raised it before the party did, that that's worse than a party raising it first. Is that your position? That that -- that the court of appeals has more power after a party who has forfeited below or waived below now tries to come up on appeal and assert a defense that they didn't assert below? Now the court of appeals has more power? But those arguments were rejected in Granberry and Day. Why should they win now? So what's wrong with that? Why should we be penalizing the State for trying to simplify an action, and make it move more expeditiously? Can I, can I ask you, do you mean to tell me that, using your own words in your brief, that a waiver is the intentional abandonment of a known right? I think you're equating intentional abandonment of a known right to be: I have to admit I could win and I'm giving up that argument. Is that what you're saying, intent, deliberate? Well, you knew you had a defense under the statute of limitations. You thought, because you conceded, that you weren't conceding that it was untimely. So you were conceding you thought it was untimely. And despite admitting that you knew you had a defense, that you knew it could win, you were choosing not to assert it. So tell me why that's not either an intentional waiver, a deliberate waiver or an abandonment of a known right? You were protecting the court's right to do whatever it wanted. So why isn't it an abuse of discretion for an appellate court, when there has been an intentional abandonment of a known right, to sua sponte raise that defense? I'm sorry. The new case law is what I said. When you say, I won't raise this defense; I waive it, everything you said except saying I don't admit it, today, before this circuit court abuses its discretion, you also have to say: I am waiving the right of the Court of Appeals to raise this sua sponte. That's -- you want that to be what you need to do for us to find a waiver. ",counsel we ask for two question present the first be do court of appeal have the power sua sponte to raise issue and in your reply brief you appear to say yes they do in some circumstance so be you concede that that power exist or that there be no power whatsoever be that a question of power or a question of exercise of discretion that seem sort of strange both rely on a factual situation either you can do something or you can not that be power if you can do it sometimes that be still power and then the question be do you do it when you could not do it so all this fight be about be whether there be a deliberate waiver or not as oppose to power only the opportunity or when it acknowledge in day we fault the district court for not tell the state essentially which not tell the state that it have a potential statute of limitation defense be it your position that if the state have just be silent about the statute of limitation defense and not raise it that the court of appeal would not have power or be it your position that because they know they have the defense and do not raise it that the court of appeal do not have power to sua sponte raise it you be not answer my question do the court of appeal have the power sua sponte to raise it if the state neither the court or the state address the issue all right so it do not have the power if the issue have be raise be that your position I be a little confused you seem to be argue that because the court of appeal raise it before the party do that that be bad than a party raise it first be that your position that that that the court of appeal have more power after a party who have forfeit below or waive below now try to come up on appeal and assert a defense that they do not assert below now the court of appeal have more power but those argument we be reject in granberry and day why should they win now so what be wrong with that why should we be penalize the state for try to simplify an action and make it move more expeditiously can i can i ask you do you mean to tell me that use your own word in your brief that a waiver be the intentional abandonment of a know right i think you be equate intentional abandonment of a know right to be i have to admit i could win and I be give up that argument be that what you be say intent deliberate well you know you have a defense under the statute of limitation you think because you concede that you be not concede that it be untimely so you we be concede you think it be untimely and despite admit that you know you have a defense that you know it could win you we be choose not to assert it so tell me why that be not either an intentional waiver a deliberate waiver or an abandonment of a know right you we be protect the court s right to do whatever it want so why be not it an abuse of discretion for an appellate court when there have be an intentional abandonment of a know right to sua sponte raise that defense I be sorry the new case law be what i say when you say i will not raise this defense i waive it everything you say except say i do not admit it today before this circuit court abuse its discretion you also have to say i be waive the right of the court of appeal to raise this sua sponte that be you want that to be what you need to do for us to find a waiver ,269.48999999999995,Roberts Court,"Feb 27, 2012",Patrick Wood,"Kevin Milyard, Warden, Sterling Correctional Facility, et al.",10-9995,"Sep 27, 2011","Apr 24, 2012",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2011,National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel-- --Mr. Long, in Bowles, the Court looked to the long history of appellate issues as being jurisdictional, in its traditional sense, not as a claim processing rule, but as a pure jurisdiction rule, the power of the Court to hear a case. From all the questions here, I count at least four cases in the Court's history where the Court has accepted a waiver by the Solicitor General and reached a tax issue. I have at least three cases, one of them just mentioned by Justice Kagan, where exceptions to that rule were read in. Given that history, regardless of how we define jurisdictional statutes versus claim processing statutes in recent times, isn't the fairer statement that Congress has accepted that in the extraordinary case we will hear the case? But doesn't that just prove that it knows that the Court will impose a claim processing rule in many circumstances, and so, in those in which it specifically doesn't want the Court to, it has to be clearer? Could you go back to the question that Justice Alito asked. Assuming we find that this is not jurisdictional, what is the parade of horribles that you see occurring if we call this a mandatory claim processing rule? What kinds of cases do you imagine that courts will reach? That wasn't my question. My question was if we deem this a mandatory claim processing rule-- --what cases do you imagine courts will reach on what grounds? Assuming the government does its job and comes in and raises the AIA as an immediate defense-- --where can a Court then reach the question, despite-- --Assumes the lack of competency of the government, which I don't, but what other types of cases? But Bob Jones involved a statute where it denominated the exaction as a tax. Here we have one where the Congress is not denominating it as a tax; it's denominating it as a penalty. Absolutely. But even the section of the Code that you referred to previously, the one following 7421, the AIA, it does very clearly make a difference -- 7422 -- make a difference between tax and penalties. It's very explicit. Could you tell me why you think the Solicitor General's reading creates a problem? That it is a jurisdictional bar, but there's an exemption for those items that Congress has designated solely as penalties that are not like taxes. But that's not -- that's carrying it too far, because he says if a penalty is designated as a tax by Congress then it's subject to the AIA, and that's most of the code, the tax code. And he says for those portions of the Affordable Care Act that designate things as taxes, the AIA applies. So it's only -- and I haven't found another statute. I'm going to ask him if there's another one. It's only for those statutes in which Congress has designated something solely as a penalty. And not indicated that it is a tax. They don't fall within the AIA. Well, General, you also have the Bailey child labor tax cases, because there the Court said that the tax, which was a prohibitory tax alone, was a tax subject to the AIA, and then it said it was beyond the Court's taxing power in a separate case, correct? That's a different issue-- --How, if you're troubled-- --Could we address, General, the question of whether there are any collateral consequences for the failure to buy -- to not buy health insurance? Is the only consequence the payment of the penalty? The private respondents argue that there are other collateral consequences such as for people on probation who are disobeying the law, if they don't buy health insurance they would be disobeying the law and could be subject to having their supervised release revoked. Is your whole point that this was inartful drafting by Congress; that, to the extent that there is an exemption under the penalty, it's an exemption from the legal obligation? And there is an additional textural indication of that, which one can find at page 13 of our reply brief. This is a provision that is 42 U.S.C. A, section 18022(e). This is a provision that provides for a certification that certain individuals can get. And it's the paragraph starting with the words ""other provisions"", contains the quote. And it says: ""An individual with a certification that the individual is exempt from the requirement under section 5000A, by reason of section 5000A(e)(1) of such code, is entitled to a certificate that allows for enrollment in a particular program for this category of people. "" But you can see here, Congress is saying it's an exemption from under 5000A(e)(1), which is the exemption from the penalty, and not the underlying requirement is, as Congress says, an exemption from the requirement of section 5000A. General, but I thought the people who were eligible for Medicaid weren't subject to the penalty. Am I wrong? I could be just factually wrong. Yes. But those people below. Well, why is it-- --But tell me something, why isn't this case subject to the same bars that -- that you list in your brief? The Tax Court, at least so far, considers constitutional challenges to statutes, so why aren't we -- why isn't this case subject to a dismissal for failure to exhaust? No -- that -- that -- that's not true. The suit here has nothing to do with hearing the action. It has to do with a form of relief that Congress is barring. It's not permitting -- it is not a tax case, you can come in afterwards. It's not permitting the court to exercise what otherwise would be one of its powers. It does seem strange to think of a -- a law that says no court can entertain a certain action and give a certain remedy as merely a claim processing rule. What the -- the Court is being ousted from -- from what would otherwise be its power to hear something. How do you deal with this case and our Gonzalez -- our recent Gonzalez case where we talked about-- --the language of the COA statute that no appeal will be heard absent the issuance of? There is an argument that we should just simply say that Bowles applies only to appeals, but we haven't said that. Counsel, all of those -- all of that in particular-- --And we haven't relied on it in other cases. Many of which themselves speak in very clear jurisdictional language. So why don't we say -- why don't we say it's jurisdictional except when the Solicitor General waives? Why would that not promote Congress's policy of insuring -- or Congress, explicitly-- --Yes. It's a contradiction in terms. I don't disagree. They raised it and then gave it up. I'm -- I'm a little bit confused. And this is what I'm confused about. There -- there is a challenge to the individual mandate. All right. What is -- the fact that the State is challenging Medicaid, how does it give the State standing to challenge an obligation that is not imposed on the State in any way? Yes. That's what I'm-- --I'm confused by it. General-- General, I see or have seen three strands of arguments in your briefs, and one of them is echoed today. The first strand that I have seen is that Congress can pass any necessary laws to effect those powers within its rights, i.e., because it made a decision that to effect, to effect mandatory issuance of insurance, that it could also obligate the mandatory purchase of it. The second strand I see is self-insurance affects the market, and so the government can regulate those who self-insure. And the third argument -- and I see all of them as different -- is that what the government is doing, and I think it's the argument you're making today -- that what the -- what the government is saying is if you pay for -- if you use health services, you have to pay with insurance. Because only insurance will guarantee that whatever need for health care that you have will be covered. Because virtually no one, perhaps with the exception of 1 percent of the population, can afford the massive cost if the unexpected happens. This third argument seems to be saying what we are regulating is health care, and when you go for health services, you have to pay for insurance, and since insurance won't issue at the moment that you consume the product, we can reasonably, necessarily tell you to buy it ahead of time, because you can't buy it at the moment that you need it. Is that -- which of these three is your argument? Are all of them your argument? I'm just not sure what the-- --So on that ground, you're answering affirmatively to my colleagues that have asked you the question, can the government force you into commerce. And there is no limit to that power. General, could you turn to the tax clause? I have looked for a case that involves the issue of whether something denominated by Congress as a penalty was nevertheless treated as a tax, except in those situations where the code itself or the statute itself said treat the penalty as a tax. Do you know of any case where we've done that? --General, the problem goes back to the limiting principle. Is this simply anything that raises revenue that Congress can do? So there has to be a limiting principle -- --Do you accept your -- the General's position that you have conceded that Congress could say, if you're going to consume health services, you have to pay by way of insurance? All right. So what do you do with the impossibility of buying insurance at the point of consumption. Virtually, you force insurance companies to sell it to you? Could we have an exemption? Could the government say, everybody pays a shared health care responsibility payment to offset all the money that we are forced to spend on health care, we the government; but, anybody who has an insurance policy is exempt from that tax? Could the government do that? Under what theory wouldn't it be? We get tax credits for having solar-powered homes. We get tax credits for using fuel efficient cars. Why couldn't we get a tax credit for having health insurance and saving the government from caring for us. But we don't in car insurance, meaning we tell people, buy car -- not we, the states do, although you're going to -- I'll ask you the question, do you think that if some states decided not to impose an insurance requirement, that the Federal Government would be without power to legislate and require every individual to buy car insurance? Well, that goes back to the substantive due process question. Is this a Lochner era argument that only the states can do this, even though it affects commerce? Cars indisputably affect commerce. So are you arguing that because the states have done it all along, the Federal Government is no longer permitted to legislate in this area? Health insurance -- I mean, I've never gotten into an accident, thankfully, and I hope never. The vast majority of people have never gotten into an accident where they have injured others; yet, we pay for it dutifully every year on the possibility that at some point we might get into that accident. But you're -- but the given is that virtually everyone, absent some intervention from above, meaning that someone's life will be cut short in a fatal way, virtually everyone will use health care. Yes, but that's exactly what Justice Marshall said in Gibbons. He said that it is the power to regulate, the power like all others vested in Congress is complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations other than those prescribed in the Constitution. But there is no conscription in the, set forth in the Constitution with respect to regulating commerce. Would you tell me, do you think the States could pass this mandate. Is there any other area of commerce, business, where we have held that there is a concurrent power between the State and the Federal Government to protect the welfare of commerce? I mean, but that's true of almost every product. It's true of almost every product, directly or indirectly by government regulation. The government says, borrowing my colleague's example, you can't buy a car without emission control. I don't want a car with emission control. It's less efficient in terms of the horsepower. But I'm forced to do something I don't want to do by government regulation. They force me to buy-- --They forced me to buy if I need unpasteurized foods, goods that don't have certain pesticides but have others. There is government compulsion in almost every economic decision because the government regulates so much. It's a condition of life that some may rail against, but-- --We let the government regulate the manufacturing process whether or not the goods will enter into interstate commerce, merely because they might statistically. We -- there is all sorts of government regulation of manufacturing plants, of agricultural farms, of all sorts of activity that will be purely intrastate because it might affect interstate activity. So how is that different from saying you are self-insuring today, you're foregoing insurance? Why isn't that a predecessor to the need that you're eventually going to have? Do you think that there's -- what percentage of the American people who took their son or daughter to an emergency room and that child was turned away because the parent didn't have insurance -- do you think there's a large percentage of the American population who would stand for the death of that child-- --They had an allergic reaction and a simple shot would have saved the child? I'm sorry, did you say the penalty's okay but not the mandate? I'm sorry. Maybe I've misheard you. So the-- --So the -- I -- I want to understand the choices you're saying Congress has. Congress can tax everybody and set up a public health care system. That would be okay. Okay. Congress can -- you're taking the same position as your colleague, Congress can't say we're going to set up a public health system, but you can get a tax credit if you have private health insurance because you won't access the public system. Are you taking the same position as your colleague? So how is this different than this Act which says if a taxpayer fails to meet the requirement of having minimum coverage, then they are responsible for paying the shared responsibility payment? I think -- I think that's what's happening, isn't it? We're paying -- I thought that everybody was paying, what is it, $10 a pack now? I don't even know the price. It's pretty high. I think everybody recognizes that it's all taxation for the purposes of dissuading you to buy it. Counsel, that may well be true. The economists are going back and forth on that issue, and the figures vary from up 10 percent to up 30. We are not in the habit of doing the legislative findings. What we do know is that for those States that found prices increasing, that they found various solutions to that. In one instance, and we might or may not say that it's unconstitutional, Massachusetts passed the mandatory coverage provision. But others adjusted some of the other provisions. Why shouldn't we let Congress do that, if in fact, the economists prove, some of the economists prove right, that prices will spiral? What's wrong with leaving it to -- in the hands of the people who should be fixing this, not us? That's all it said it's essential to. I mean, I'm looking at it. The exchanges, the State exchanges are information -- gathering facilities that tell insurers what the various policies actually mean. And that has proven to be a cost saver in many of the States who have tried it. So why should we be striking down a cost saver when if what your argument is, was, that Congress was concerned about costs rising? Why should we assume they wouldn't have passed that information? I want a bottom line is why don't we let Congress fix it? We are not taking -- If we strike down one provision, we are not taking that power away from Congress. Congress could look at it without the mandatory coverage provision and say, this model doesn't work; let's start from the beginning. Or it could choose to fix what it has. We are not declaring -- one portion doesn't force Congress into any path. Are you suggesting that we should take on more power to the Court? Because Congress would choose to take one path rather than another. That's sort of taking onto the Court more power than one I think would want. Well, but it's not-- --No statute can do that, because once we chop off a piece of it, by definition, it's not the statute Congress passed. So it has to be something more than that. So what is wrong with the presumption that our law says, which is we presume that Congress would want to sever? Wouldn't that be the simplest, most objective test? Going past what Justice Scalia says we have done, okay, get rid of legislative intent altogether, which some of our colleagues in other contexts have promoted, and just say: Unless Congress tells us directly, it's not severable, we shouldn't sever. We should let them fix their problems. You still haven't asked -- answered me why in a democracy structured like ours, where each branch does different things, why we should involve the Court in making the legislative judgment? It's not a new rule. We presume. We've rebutted the presumption in some cases-- --But some would call that judicial action. And what's wrong with that? But-- --Mr. Kneedler would you please-- --Mr. Kneedler, move away from the issue of whether it's a standing question or not. Make the assumption that's an -- that this is an issue of the Court's exercise of discretion. Because the last two questions had to do with what's wise for the Court to do, not whether it has power to do it or not. So let's move beyond the power issue, which your answers have centered on, and give me a sort of -- policy. And I know that's a, that's a bugaboo word sometimes, but what should guide the Court's discretion? Would you please -- I've asked you three times to move around that. I thought the answer was you don't have to because-- --what we have to look at is what Congress said was essential, correct? Could you get back to the argument of -- of the heart? Striking down the heart, do we want half a loaf or show. I think those are the two analogies-- --I thought that the 26-year-olds were saying that they were healthy and didn't need insurance yesterday. So today they are going to bankrupt the-- Counsel, the problem I have is that you are ignoring the congressional findings and all of the evidence Congress had before it that community ratings and guaranteed-issuance would be a death spiral -- I think that was the word that was used -- without minimum coverage. Those are all of the materials that are part of the legislative record here. So even if it might not be because of the structure of the Act, that's post hoc evidence. Why should we be looking at that as opposed to what Congress had before it and use essential in its plain meaning.

 can't have minimum coverage without, what the SG is arguing, community ratings and guaranteed-issue. You can't have those two without minimum coverage. But you don't want them to say, either, that there is a death spiral. Do you want -- you don't want us to make either of those two findings, I'm assuming? --Amicis' point, he says that Congress didn't go into this Act to impose minimum coverage. They went into the Act to have a different purpose, i.e., to get people coverage jury when they needed it, to increase coverage for people, but this is only a tool. But other States -- going back to my original point, that are other tools besides minimum coverage that Congress can achieve these goals. So if we strike just a tool, why should we strike the whole Act, when Congress has other tools available? Well, is that a limit on the Federal government's power to tax?. Are you suggesting that at a certain point the States would have a claim against the Federal government raising their taxes because somehow the States will feel coerced to lower their tax rate? Now, counsel, what percentage does it become coercive? Meaning, as I look at the figures I've seen from amici, there are some states for whom the percentage of Medicaid funding to their budget is close to 40 percent, but there are others that are less than 10 percent. And you say, across the board this is coercive because no state, even at 10 percent, can give it up. What's the percentage of big gift that the federal government can give? Because what you're saying to me is, for a bankrupt state, there's no gift the federal government could give them ever, because it can only give them money without conditions. No matter how poorly the state is run, no matter how much the federal government doesn't want to subsidize abortions or doesn't want to subsidize some other state obligation, the federal government can't give them 100 percent of their needs. What makes them coercive; that the state doesn't want to face its voters and say, instead of taking 10, 20, 30, 40 percent of the government's offer of our budget and paying for it ourselves and giving up money for some other function? That's what makes it coercive-- --that the state is unwilling to say that? Mr. Clement, do you think that the Federal Government couldn't, if it chose, Congress, say, this system doesn't work. We are just simply going to rehaul it. It is not consistent with how -- what we want to accomplish. We're just going to do away with the system and start a new health care plan of some sort. And States, you can take the new plan, you can leave them. We are going to give out 20 percent less, maybe 20 percent more, depending on what Congress chooses. Can Congress do that? Does it have to continue the old system because that is what the States are relying upon and it's coercive now to give them a new system? That's what I -- I want to know how I draw the line, meaning-- --I think the usual definition of coercion is, I don't have a choice. I'm not sure what -- why it's not a choice for the States. They may not pay for something else. If they don't take Medicaid and they want to keep the same level of coverage, they may have to make cuts in their budget to other services they provide. That's a political choice of whether they choose to do that or not. But when have we defined the right or limited the right of government not to spend money in the ways that it thinks appropriate? I guess my greatest fear, Mr. Clement, with your argument is the following: The bigger the problem, the more resources it needs. We're going to tie the hands of the Federal government in choosing how to structure a cooperative relationship with the States. We're going to say to the Federal government, the bigger the problem, the less your powers are. Because once you give that much money, you can't structure the program the way you want. It's our money, Federal government. We're going to have to run the program ourself to protect all our interests. I don't see where to draw that line. The uninsured are a problem for States only because they, too, politically, just like the Federal government, can't let the poor die. And so to the extent they don't want to do that, it's because they feel accountable to their citizenry. And so if they want to do it their way, they have to spend the money to do it their way, if they don't want to do it the Federal way. So I -- I just don't understand the logic of saying States, you can't -- you don't -- you're not entitled to our money, but once you start taking it, the more you take, the more power you have. Mr Clement. He's not going home tonight-- --But could you tell me-- --I don't understand your first answer to Justice Kagan. You don't see there being a difference between the Federal government saying we want to take care of the poor. States, if you do this, we'll pay 100 percent of your administrative costs. And you said that could be coercion. All right. Doesn't the amount of burden that the State undertakes to meet the Federal obligation count in this equation at all? Counsel, if we go pack to the era of matching what a State pays to what a State gets, Florida loses. It's citizens pay out much less than what they get back in Federal subsidies of all kinds. So you can't really be making the argument that Florida can't ask for more than it gives, because it's really giving less than it receives. You don't really want to go to that point, do you? Can we go back-- --General, I'm trying. --to go back to that. Because Justice Kennedy asked you whether there is -- I think he said it's -- it's coercion if no one can be politically accountable. I'm not sure how that could be practically politically accountable, because almost every gift -- if the terms are attractive, it would be an unattractive political alternative to turn it down. Dole itself was one of those cases. I think every State raised the drinking age to 21; correct? I guess my point is that political accountability has two components: What can I do if I like something, and what can I do if I don't like something. And if people really like something like Medicaid, they were not going to let you drop it, correct. Exactly. That's the whole point that's their choice, right? They made a choice with the stimulus bill, didn't they? Some governors rejected the stimulus bill-- --and some of -- some of their congressional or legislative processes overturned that-- --and others supported it. The percentages were smaller, but it's always the preference of the voters as to what they want, isn't it? ",counsel mr long in bowles the court look to the long history of appellate issue as be jurisdictional in its traditional sense not as a claim processing rule but as a pure jurisdiction rule the power of the court to hear a case from all the question here i count at least four case in the court s history where the court have accept a waiver by the solicitor general and reach a tax issue i have at least three case one of them just mention by justice kagan where exception to that rule we be read in give that history regardless of how we define jurisdictional statute versus claim processing statute in recent time be not the fairer statement that congress have accept that in the extraordinary case we will hear the case but do not that just prove that it know that the court will impose a claim processing rule in many circumstance and so in those in which it specifically do not want the court to it have to be clear could you go back to the question that justice alito ask assume we find that this be not jurisdictional what be the parade of horribles that you see occur if we call this a mandatory claim processing rule what kinds of case do you imagine that court will reach that be not my question my question be if we deem this a mandatory claim processing rule what case do you imagine court will reach on what ground assume the government do its job and come in and raise the aia as an immediate defense where can a court then reach the question despite assume the lack of competency of the government which i do not but what other type of case but bob jones involve a statute where it denominate the exaction as a tax here we have one where the congress be not denominate it as a tax it be denominate it as a penalty absolutely but even the section of the code that you refer to previously the one following the aia it do very clearly make a difference make a difference between tax and penalty it be very explicit could you tell me why you think the solicitor general s reading create a problem that it be a jurisdictional bar but there be an exemption for those item that congress have designate solely as penalty that be not like tax but that be not that be carry it too far because he say if a penalty be designate as a tax by congress then it be subject to the aia and that be most of the code the tax code and he say for those portion of the affordable care act that designate thing as tax the aia applies so it be only and i have not find another statute I be go to ask him if there be another one it be only for those statute in which congress have designate something solely as a penalty and not indicate that it be a tax they do not fall within the aia well general you also have the bailey child labor tax case because there the court say that the tax which be a prohibitory tax alone be a tax subject to the aia and then it say it be beyond the court s tax power in a separate case correct that be a different issue how if you be troubled could we address general the question of whether there be any collateral consequence for the failure to buy to not buy health insurance be the only consequence the payment of the penalty the private respondent argue that there be other collateral consequence such as for people on probation who be disobey the law if they do not buy health insurance they would be disobey the law and could be subject to have their supervised release revoke be your whole point that this be inartful drafting by congress that to the extent that there be an exemption under the penalty it be an exemption from the legal obligation and there be an additional textural indication of that which one can find at page of our reply brief this be a provision that be usc a section e this be a provision that provide for a certification that certain individual can get and it be the paragraph start with the word other provision contain the quote and it say an individual with a certification that the individual be exempt from the requirement under section a by reason of section a e of such code be entitle to a certificate that allow for enrollment in a particular program for this category of people but you can see here congress be say it be an exemption from under a e which be the exemption from the penalty and not the underlying requirement be as congress say an exemption from the requirement of section a general but i think the people who we be eligible for medicaid be not subject to the penalty be i wrong i could be just factually wrong yes but those people below well why be it but tell me something why be not this case subject to the same bar that that you list in your brief the tax court at least so far considers constitutional challenge to statute so why be not we why be not this case subject to a dismissal for failure to exhaust no that that that be not true the suit here have nothing to do with hear the action it have to do with a form of relief that congress be bar it be not permit it be not a tax case you can come in afterwards it be not permit the court to exercise what otherwise would be one of its power it do seem strange to think of a a law that say no court can entertain a certain action and give a certain remedy as merely a claim processing rule what the the court be be oust from from what would otherwise be its power to hear something how do you deal with this case and our gonzalez our recent gonzalez case where we talk about the language of the coa statute that no appeal will be hear absent the issuance of there be an argument that we should just simply say that bowles applies only to appeal but we have not say that counsel all of those all of that in particular and we have not rely on it in other case many of which themselves speak in very clear jurisdictional language so why do not we say why do not we say it be jurisdictional except when the solicitor general waif why would that not promote congress s policy of insure or congress explicitly yes it be a contradiction in term i do not disagree they raise it and then give it up I be I be a little bit confused and this be what I be confuse about there there be a challenge to the individual mandate all right what be the fact that the state be challenge medicaid how do it give the state standing to challenge an obligation that be not impose on the state in any way yes that be what I be I be confuse by it general general i see or have see three strand of argument in your brief and one of them be echo today the first strand that i have see be that congress can pass any necessary law to effect those power within its right ie because it make a decision that to effect to effect mandatory issuance of insurance that it could also obligate the mandatory purchase of it the second strand i see be self insurance affect the market and so the government can regulate those who self insure and the third argument and i see all of them as different be that what the government be do and i think it be the argument you be make today that what the what the government be say be if you pay for if you use health service you have to pay with insurance because only insurance will guarantee that whatever need for health care that you have will be cover because virtually no one perhaps with the exception of percent of the population can afford the massive cost if the unexpected happens this third argument seem to be say what we be regulate be health care and when you go for health service you have to pay for insurance and since insurance will not issue at the moment that you consume the product we can reasonably necessarily tell you to buy it ahead of time because you can not buy it at the moment that you need it be that which of these three be your argument be all of them your argument I be just not sure what the so on that ground you be answer affirmatively to my colleague that have ask you the question can the government force you into commerce and there be no limit to that power general could you turn to the tax clause i have look for a case that involve the issue of whether something denominate by congress as a penalty be nevertheless treat as a tax except in those situation where the code itself or the statute itself say treat the penalty as a tax do you know of any case where we have do that general the problem go back to the limit principle be this simply anything that raise revenue that congress can do so there have to be a limiting principle do you accept your the general s position that you have concede that congress could say if you be go to consume health service you have to pay by way of insurance all right so what do you do with the impossibility of buy insurance at the point of consumption virtually you force insurance company to sell it to you could we have an exemption could the government say everybody pay a share health care responsibility payment to offset all the money that we be force to spend on health care we the government but anybody who have an insurance policy be exempt from that tax could the government do that under what theory would not it be we get tax credit for have solar power home we get tax credit for use fuel efficient car why could not we get a tax credit for have health insurance and save the government from care for us but we do not in car insurance mean we tell people buy car not we the state do although you be go to I will ask you the question do you think that if some state decide not to impose an insurance requirement that the federal government would be without power to legislate and require every individual to buy car insurance well that go back to the substantive due process question be this a lochner era argument that only the state can do this even though it affect commerce car indisputably affect commerce so be you argue that because the state have do it all along the federal government be no longer permit to legislate in this area health insurance i mean I have never get into an accident thankfully and i hope never the vast majority of people have never get into an accident where they have injure others yet we pay for it dutifully every year on the possibility that at some point we might get into that accident but you be but the give be that virtually everyone absent some intervention from above mean that someone s life will be cut short in a fatal way virtually everyone will use health care yes but that be exactly what justice marshall say in gibbon he say that it be the power to regulate the power like all others vest in congress be complete in itself may be exercise to its utmost extent and acknowledge no limitation other than those prescribe in the constitution but there be no conscription in the set forth in the constitution with respect to regulate commerce would you tell me do you think the state could pass this mandate be there any other area of commerce business where we have hold that there be a concurrent power between the state and the federal government to protect the welfare of commerce i mean but that be true of almost every product it be true of almost every product directly or indirectly by government regulation the government say borrow my colleague s example you can not buy a car without emission control i do not want a car with emission control it be less efficient in term of the horsepower but I be force to do something i do not want to do by government regulation they force me to buy they force me to buy if i need unpasteurized food good that do not have certain pesticide but have others there be government compulsion in almost every economic decision because the government regulate so much it be a condition of life that some may rail against but we let the government regulate the manufacturing process whether or not the good will enter into interstate commerce merely because they might statistically we there be all sort of government regulation of manufacturing plant of agricultural farm of all sort of activity that will be purely intrastate because it might affect interstate activity so how be that different from say you be self insure today you be forego insurance why be not that a predecessor to the need that you be eventually go to have do you think that there be what percentage of the american people who take their son or daughter to an emergency room and that child be turn away because the parent do not have insurance do you think there be a large percentage of the american population who would stand for the death of that child they have an allergic reaction and a simple shot would have save the child I be sorry do you say the penalty s okay but not the mandate I be sorry maybe I have misheard you so the so the i i want to understand the choice you be say congress have congress can tax everybody and set up a public health care system that would be okay okay congress can you be take the same position as your colleague congress can not say we be go to set up a public health system but you can get a tax credit if you have private health insurance because you will not access the public system be you take the same position as your colleague so how be this different than this act which say if a taxpayer fail to meet the requirement of have minimum coverage then they be responsible for pay the share responsibility payment i think i think that be what be happen be not it we be pay i think that everybody be pay what be it a pack now i do not even know the price it be pretty high i think everybody recognize that it be all taxation for the purpose of dissuade you to buy it counsel that may well be true the economist be go back and forth on that issue and the figure vary from up percent to up we be not in the habit of do the legislative finding what we do know be that for those state that find price increase that they find various solution to that in one instance and we might or may not say that it be unconstitutional massachusetts pass the mandatory coverage provision but others adjust some of the other provision why should not we let congress do that if in fact the economist prove some of the economist prove right that price will spiral what be wrong with leave it to in the hand of the people who should be fix this not us that be all it say it be essential to i mean I be look at it the exchange the state exchange be information gathering facility that tell insurer what the various policy actually mean and that have prove to be a cost saver in many of the state who have try it so why should we be strike down a cost saver when if what your argument be be that congress be concern about cost rise why should we assume they would not have pass that information i want a bottom line be why do not we let congress fix it we be not take if we strike down one provision we be not take that power away from congress congress could look at it without the mandatory coverage provision and say this model do not work let us start from the beginning or it could choose to fix what it have we be not declare one portion do not force congress into any path be you suggest that we should take on more power to the court because congress would choose to take one path rather than another that be sort of take onto the court more power than one i think would want well but it be not no statute can do that because once we chop off a piece of it by definition it be not the statute congress pass so it have to be something more than that so what be wrong with the presumption that our law say which be we presume that congress would want to sever would not that be the simple most objective test go past what justice scalia say we have do okay get rid of legislative intent altogether which some of our colleague in other context have promote and just say unless congress tell us directly it be not severable we should not sever we should let them fix their problem you still have not ask answer me why in a democracy structure like ours where each branch do different thing why we should involve the court in make the legislative judgment it be not a new rule we presume we have rebut the presumption in some case but some would call that judicial action and what be wrong with that but mr kneedler would you please mr kneedler move away from the issue of whether it be a stand question or not make the assumption that be an that this be an issue of the court s exercise of discretion because the last two question have to do with what have wise for the court to do not whether it have power to do it or not so let us move beyond the power issue which your answer have center on and give me a sort of policy and i know that be a that be a bugaboo word sometimes but what should guide the court s discretion would you please I have ask you three time to move around that i think the answer be you do not have to because what we have to look at be what congress say be essential correct could you get back to the argument of of the heart strike down the heart do we want half a loaf or show i think those be the two analogy i think that the year olds we be say that they we be healthy and do not need insurance yesterday so today they be go to bankrupt the counsel the problem i have be that you be ignore the congressional finding and all of the evidence congress have before it that community rating and guaranteed issuance would be a death spiral i think that be the word that be use without minimum coverage those be all of the material that be part of the legislative record here so even if it might not be because of the structure of the act that be post hoc evidence why should we be look at that as oppose to what congress have before it and use essential in its plain meaning you can not have minimum coverage without what the sg be argue community rating and guaranteed issue you can not have those two without minimum coverage but you do not want them to say either that there be a death spiral do you want you do not want us to make either of those two finding I be assume amicis point he say that congress do not go into this act to impose minimum coverage they go into the act to have a different purpose ie to get people coverage jury when they need it to increase coverage for people but this be only a tool but other state go back to my original point that be other tool besides minimum coverage that congress can achieve these goal so if we strike just a tool why should we strike the whole act when congress have other tool available well be that a limit on the federal government s power to tax be you suggest that at a certain point the state would have a claim against the federal government raise their tax because somehow the state will feel coerce to lower their tax rate now counsel what percentage do it become coercive meaning as i look at the figure I have see from amici there be some state for whom the percentage of medicaid funding to their budget be close to percent but there be others that be less than percent and you say across the board this be coercive because no state even at percent can give it up what be the percentage of big gift that the federal government can give because what you be say to me be for a bankrupt state there be no gift the federal government could give them ever because it can only give them money without condition no matter how poorly the state be run no matter how much the federal government do not want to subsidize abortion or do not want to subsidize some other state obligation the federal government can not give them percent of their need what make them coercive that the state do not want to face its voter and say instead of take percent of the government s offer of our budget and pay for it ourselves and give up money for some other function that be what make it coercive that the state be unwilling to say that mr clement do you think that the federal government could not if it choose congress say this system do not work we be just simply go to rehaul it it be not consistent with how what we want to accomplish we be just go to do away with the system and start a new health care plan of some sort and state you can take the new plan you can leave them we be go to give out percent less maybe percent more depend on what congress choose can congress do that do it have to continue the old system because that be what the state be rely upon and it be coercive now to give them a new system that be what i i want to know how i draw the line meaning i think the usual definition of coercion be i do not have a choice I be not sure what why it be not a choice for the state they may not pay for something else if they do not take medicaid and they want to keep the same level of coverage they may have to make cut in their budget to other service they provide that be a political choice of whether they choose to do that or not but when have we define the right or limit the right of government not to spend money in the way that it think appropriate i guess my great fear mr clement with your argument be the following the big the problem the more resource it need we be go to tie the hand of the federal government in choose how to structure a cooperative relationship with the state we be go to say to the federal government the big the problem the less your power be because once you give that much money you can not structure the program the way you want it be our money federal government we be go to have to run the program ourself to protect all our interest i do not see where to draw that line the uninsured be a problem for state only because they too politically just like the federal government can not let the poor die and so to the extent they do not want to do that it be because they feel accountable to their citizenry and so if they want to do it their way they have to spend the money to do it their way if they do not want to do it the federal way so i i just do not understand the logic of say state you can not you do not you be not entitle to our money but once you start take it the more you take the more power you have mr clement he be not go home tonight but could you tell me i do not understand your first answer to justice kagan you do not see there be a difference between the federal government say we want to take care of the poor state if you do this we will pay percent of your administrative cost and you say that could be coercion all right do not the amount of burden that the state undertakes to meet the federal obligation count in this equation at all counsel if we go pack to the era of match what a state pay to what a state get florida loses it be citizens pay out much less than what they get back in federal subsidy of all kind so you can not really be make the argument that florida can not ask for more than it give because it be really give less than it receive you do not really want to go to that point do you can we go back general I be try to go back to that because justice kennedy ask you whether there be i think he say it be it be coercion if no one can be politically accountable I be not sure how that could be practically politically accountable because almost every gift if the term be attractive it would be an unattractive political alternative to turn it down dole itself be one of those case i think every state raise the drinking age to correct i guess my point be that political accountability have two component what can i do if i like something and what can i do if i do not like something and if people really like something like medicaid they we be not go to let you drop it correct exactly that be the whole point that be their choice right they make a choice with the stimulus bill do not they some governor reject the stimulus bill and some of some of their congressional or legislative process overturn that and others support it the percentage we be small but it be always the preference of the voter as to what they want be not it ,6407.39,Roberts Court,"Mar  26 - 28, 2012","National Federation of Independent Business, et al.","Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of Health and Human Services,

2011,Christopher v. SmithKline,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Could you answer Justice Alito's question? Your brief to the Second Circuit and the Ninth Circuit suggested that a sale is a -- is a transaction, a transfer of some sort, or at least a promise to purchase. But your brief here holds IT a much more rigid test, that there has to be a transfer of title. And he pointed to the language of 3(x) -- 3(k), that says ""consignment for sale"", which doesn't have a transfer of the title. So what is the government's position? Counsel, can I-- --Counsel, I thought that this whole system was set up on giving industries the opportunity to ask the government for an opinion letter, correct? I saw in the briefing hundreds of opinion letters by hundreds of different industries. Outside of this 1945 letter, did anybody else, any other pharmaceutical company, ever set out for the government or seek an opinion letter that you're aware of? Can you give me what your regulation is going to be? And would it exempt everybody from coverage? Meaning, you seem to be saying if in some sense they make sales, it seems that every promotional person will be a salesman, that all industries have to do is put one or two forms of sales activities involved in the work of their worker, and they are exempt. Give me your definition? As long as it's in some sense, that covers everybody's exempt? Well, it seems like the sale here is not the primary duty. The sale here is to schmooze the doctor and give him information. That's what you said in one of your briefs, your company said in one of its briefs in a product liability litigation. Primary duty is one of the limiting, and what was the second limiting principle? How is that different from a bonus that an employee gets? How is it any different than what most companies do in -- in giving a bonus at the end of the year? Mr. Clement, you give me one definition of ""outside salesmen"", the one that you prefer for us to apply here. The Department of Labor gives another, and the one they're giving according to them is a bright-line rule. It's easy to apply. You have to do some sort of transfer of title. That's as -- their rule.

2011,Dorsey v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Do you think it's a clear and unmistakable implication-- --if we are going to argue about the language? Well, generally the word ""express"" incorporates ""clear"". So that -- why doesn't that defeat your case? Mr. Dreeben, almost any law that repeals a prior penalty is doing so because the legislature determines that that prior penalty is unjust in some way, because why do you eliminate a penalty unless you think it is necessary to do so and that it is injust or unjust in some way? So what makes this repeal particularly different so that the exception doesn't swallow the rule, because you can argue in almost any situation that the repeal is of something that's unjust? Mr. Estrada, what's so difficult for a legal doctrine to say that when Congress has made a finding that a law has a discriminatory impact -- because I always thought that when discrimination was at issue, that we should do as speedy a remedy as we could, because it is one of the most fundamental tenets of our Constitution, as has been repeatedly emphasized in case after case, that our laws should be -- should be enforced in a race-neutral way. Once Congress has said this law's not being enforced in a race-neutral way, we want to fix it, why shouldn't our presumption be that the fix is immediate rather than delayed? Mr. Estrada, I've been a judge for nearly 20 years, and I don't know that there's one law that has created more controversy or more discussion about its racial impact than this one. I don't think there is any other law that had as much conversation about its racial implications than this one. Well, but this-- --Mr. Estrada, even without the guideline amendment, for those defendants who committed crimes after the effective date of this Act, they would not have had -- new offense, not old offense -- if the day after this Act they committed the offense, they wouldn't have had a mandatory minimum that required their imprisonment for a certain amount of time, because the Act had already done away with the mandatory minimum, correct? Or changed the guide-- --Changed it, Lowered the amounts. Exactly. So those people would not have been bound to a mandatory minimum. And since district courts were not bound to the guidelines anyway, even if there had been no amendment to the guideline, the judges would have known they weren't bound to the mandatory minimum, and probably not bound to guidelines that hadn't been amended yet either. So it would have benefited these defendants no matter what. No, only in cases like this, where we know they have to change because Congress has directed they be changed. But the problem I started with, with you, which is if we know that this new Congress has already determined that those -- that mandatory minimum is discriminatory in the way that it had been constructed, what would be the purpose of delaying implementation? Mr. Estrada-- --Mr. Estrada, I'm not sure I follow-- --I'm sorry. I'm not sure I follow your example. I think that the guideline regulation is that the guideline -- the Sentencing Commission always has to be -- pass guidelines consistent with the mandatory minimum. And if the statute says that the mandatory minimum requires the -- the carrying medium to be included, the guidelines can't change that. The mandatory minimum would apply. But defendant -- I don't know that I know of one guideline scheme that changes whatever Congress has statutorily required. No, no. You have to -- what you are arguing is not that the guidelines would be available for new offenses. What you are arguing is that they would be available for everybody except the cliffhangers. That's -- that's what you're arguing. Everyone but the cliffhangers, because, as Justice Breyer pointed out, those people who were subject to the old guideline at a higher rate above the minimum now have the benefit of a lower rate, and so they're going to get sentenced to a lower amount because they are not bound by the mandatory minimum. ",do you think it be a clear and unmistakable implication if we be go to argue about the language well generally the word express incorporate clear so that why do not that defeat your case mr dreeben almost any law that repeal a prior penalty be do so because the legislature determine that that prior penalty be unjust in some way because why do you eliminate a penalty unless you think it be necessary to do so and that it be injust or unjust in some way so what make this repeal particularly different so that the exception do not swallow the rule because you can argue in almost any situation that the repeal be of something that be unjust mr estrada what be so difficult for a legal doctrine to say that when congress have make a finding that a law have a discriminatory impact because i always think that when discrimination be at issue that we should do as speedy a remedy as we could because it be one of the most fundamental tenet of our constitution as have be repeatedly emphasize in case after case that our law should be should be enforce in a race neutral way once congress have say this law s not be enforce in a race neutral way we want to fix it why should not our presumption be that the fix be immediate rather than delay mr estrada I have be a judge for nearly year and i do not know that there be one law that have create more controversy or more discussion about its racial impact than this one i do not think there be any other law that have as much conversation about its racial implication than this one well but this mr estrada even without the guideline amendment for those defendant who commit crime after the effective date of this act they would not have have new offense not old offense if the day after this act they commit the offense they would not have have a mandatory minimum that require their imprisonment for a certain amount of time because the act have already do away with the mandatory minimum correct or change the guide change it lower the amount exactly so those people would not have be bind to a mandatory minimum and since district court we be not bind to the guideline anyway even if there have be no amendment to the guideline the judge would have know they be not bind to the mandatory minimum and probably not bind to guideline that have not be amend yet either so it would have benefit these defendant no matter what no only in case like this where we know they have to change because congress have direct they be change but the problem i start with with you which be if we know that this new congress have already determine that those that mandatory minimum be discriminatory in the way that it have be construct what would be the purpose of delay implementation mr estrada mr estrada I be not sure i follow I be sorry I be not sure i follow your example i think that the guideline regulation be that the guideline the sentence commission always have to be pass guideline consistent with the mandatory minimum and if the statute say that the mandatory minimum require the the carry medium to be include the guideline can not change that the mandatory minimum would apply but defendant i do not know that i know of one guideline scheme that change whatever congress have statutorily require no no you have to what you be argue be not that the guideline would be available for new offense what you be argue be that they would be available for everybody except the cliffhanger that be that be what you be argue everyone but the cliffhanger because as justice breyer point out those people who we be subject to the old guideline at a high rate above the minimum now have the benefit of a low rate and so they be go to get sentence to a low amount because they be not bind by the mandatory minimum ,263.2299999999999,Roberts Court,"Apr 17, 2012","Edward Dorsey, Sr.",United States,11-5683,"Nov 28, 2011","Jun 21, 2012",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2011,Elgin v. Department of the Treasury,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, do you-- --Are you talking about a facial challenge to the statute? As a -- am I understanding you right? A facial challenge goes to the district court and a constitutional as-applied challenge goes to the commission? Could you tell me how -- how -- how this is any different than the administrative system and review system that was reviewed in Thunder Basin and Illinois Long-Term Care? In both those statutes, the agencies weren't permitted to consider facial challenges, constitutional challenges; and we said that's okay, they can't, but the reviewing court can. So how's that any different from the situation you're proposing here? But please deal with the language of both cases. Both cases said even if the agency can't review a constitutional challenge, there is still review within the Federal Circuit, within the court -- within the circuit courts and that's okay. So why isn't that okay here? I think that was Justice Scalia's question to you. I know that you say well, the Federal Circuit won't have a record. But the government says if it wants a record, it can remand and ask the agency to develop it. So what's wrong with that procedure? Isn't one of the challenges here by one of the Petitioners that he was constructively discharged? Isn't that an issue that the board is better suited to determine in the first instance, whether there was at all a constructive discharge? Is that your -- is that your answer for that's why it's an out for their failure to have gone to the Federal Circuit? Will they be able -- if the commission says, no, we won't reopen, do they have any avenue now to go to the Federal Circuit? Please finish with your answer. To go back to your interesting suggestion that the board should decide the constitutional issue, I've just been spending a little bit of time going through the act, and you're certainly -- it doesn't appear that there's anything in the act that precludes them from granting any appropriate relief with respect to an unlawful discharge. Am I correct? Is there any rule of the board that stops a litigant from making a proffer -- an offer of proof? Wouldn't that be the proper way of doing it, if you're going to go up on a constitutional claim? Make your offer of proof and then the Federal Circuit can decide if it needs more evidence or not.

2011,FAA v. Cooper,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I'm a little bit confused by that, because in your brief, the Solicitor General's brief in Doe, it described the earlier version of general damages in the following way -- and I'm quoting from your brief there: ""The general damages provision in the Senate bill likely derived from the common law of tort of invasion of privacy where general damages may be awarded as. "" --quote -- """"presumed damages"", without proof of harm. "" So I think there in Doe you argued that general damages presumed injury. But that's very different than, I think, the question Justice Ginsburg was asking you. It's -- and I read your brief and your arguments as sort of an -- an assumption that if you suffer nonpecuniary harm, you haven't been injured. There is a big difference between presumed damages and proven injury. In Gertz we reference the common law tort as requiring actual proof of injury for emotional distress. Most State laws say you have to prove the emotional distress. We are not presuming the injury. So, I guess what I'm saying to you, aren't you the one confusing what injury is from presumed damage? So why is that different from actual injury? I have -- I'm not sleeping, I have a nervous stomach, I'm not eating. The typical things that juries look at to determine whether you have proven emotional distress. Why is that not actual injury? I have looked at those cases and in all of them except for two, where the reference wasn't really precise, it was because the use of ""actual damages"" in the particular statute were limited to pecuniary harms or the nature of the harms at issue were pecuniary by nature. I'm sorry. Are you arguing that the emotional distress component can't be? So you're -- as I understand the definition of ""special damages"" in common law, if you proved any pecuniary harm you were also entitled to the mental distress damages as well. So you want half of the common law award -- award? We may have a difference of history there. Because, yes, special damages require pecuniary harm, but once you prove that, it also permitted recovery of nonpecuniary losses as well. I thought that's what your brief said, actually. But we're not talking any differently. That's what I just said. If you-- --Sort of odd for Congress to borrow from the defamation context and with a defined term of art, ""special damages"", and not use it in the Privacy Act if that's what it intended. And to use a term ""actual damages"", which has a much broader meaning than ""special damages"". Do you have any statistics on the percentage of actions brought under the Privacy Act in which the plaintiff was able to establish pecuniary harm? Are you aware of any runaway verdicts based on awards of mental damage proof? I define runaway awards as those in -- in six figures or above. Or even high five figures. Counsel, you seem to be arguing throughout that general damages meant actual damages, when general damages, in my understanding, meant two things: presumed and actual. So why is it illogical for Congress to look at what general damages meant, and pick the meaning that included proven damages, actual? I'm still confused. General damages meant presumed or actual. Congress says we don't want general damages because it includes presumed. So we are going to use the word ""actual"". How do you get from that that Congress meant ""only pecuniary""? I mean, that has its -- why didn't they just use that? Instead of ""actual damages"", why didn't they just say ""pecuniary damages"", if that's what they intended? ",I be a little bit confuse by that because in your brief the solicitor general s brief in doe it describe the early version of general damage in the following way and I be quote from your brief there the general damage provision in the senate bill likely derive from the common law of tort of invasion of privacy where general damage may be award as quote presumed damage without proof of harm so i think there in doe you argue that general damage presume injury but that be very different than i think the question justice ginsburg be ask you it be and i read your brief and your argument as sort of an an assumption that if you suffer nonpecuniary harm you have not be injure there be a big difference between presumed damage and proven injury in gertz we reference the common law tort as require actual proof of injury for emotional distress most state law say you have to prove the emotional distress we be not presume the injury so i guess what I be say to you be not you the one confuse what injury be from presume damage so why be that different from actual injury i have I be not sleep i have a nervous stomach I be not eat the typical thing that jury look at to determine whether you have prove emotional distress why be that not actual injury i have look at those case and in all of them except for two where the reference be not really precise it be because the use of actual damage in the particular statute we be limit to pecuniary harm or the nature of the harm at issue we be pecuniary by nature I be sorry be you argue that the emotional distress component can not be so you be as i understand the definition of special damage in common law if you prove any pecuniary harm you we be also entitle to the mental distress damage as well so you want half of the common law award award we may have a difference of history there because yes special damage require pecuniary harm but once you prove that it also permit recovery of nonpecuniary loss as well i think that be what your brief say actually but we be not talk any differently that be what i just say if you sort of odd for congress to borrow from the defamation context and with a defined term of art special damage and not use it in the privacy act if that be what it intend and to use a term actual damage which have a much broad meaning than special damage do you have any statistic on the percentage of action bring under the privacy act in which the plaintiff be able to establish pecuniary harm be you aware of any runaway verdict base on award of mental damage proof i define runaway award as those in in six figure or above or even high five figure counsel you seem to be argue throughout that general damage mean actual damage when general damage in my understanding meant two thing presume and actual so why be it illogical for congress to look at what general damage mean and pick the meaning that include proven damage actual I be still confuse general damage mean presume or actual congress say we do not want general damage because it include presume so we be go to use the word actual how do you get from that that congress mean only pecuniary i mean that have its why do not they just use that instead of actual damage why do not they just say pecuniary damage if that be what they intend ,279.38000000000005,Roberts Court,"Nov 30, 2011",Federal Aviation Administration,Stanmore Cooper,10-1024,"Jun 20, 2011","Mar 28, 2012",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2011,Reichle v. Howards,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, that -- that's exactly what Justice Breyer is saying. Okay? Which is, as I understand it, there is some literature that talks about should we be treating misdemeanor arrests different than felony arrests, because there is less discretion that an officer would have with respect to arresting someone for a felony than for misdemeanors or criminal fines, because like jaywalking, policemen don't arrest you for jaywalking unless they are either on a ticket binge or because there's something about you that they don't like. So if that something about you they don't like is that you are wearing an antiwar armband, are we going to let that plaintiff not recover, because somehow we need to protect police officers so much, in the discretionary use of this vast power they have to arrest that we are going to permit them to trample the First Amendment, essentially? Or are we going to say, in the normal situation there is a First Amendment claim, even with probable cause, if you can prove that it's the motivating factor for the arrest; but we treat Secret Service differently? And I think that was the point Justice Breyer's getting to, and the one I'm most interested in. If you are jaywalking, there is probable cause. But -- but -- what does it have to do with violating the First Amendment, meaning if police officers have discretion and they would not otherwise arrest you except for their dislike of your speech, that's a violation of your right to free speech, isn't it? We can go to that question later. Do you have a sense of how many of these First Amendment retaliatory claims in those jurisdictions that permit them -- I know they are more limited -- how many of these cases arise? And how many arrests are there a year? I'm sure it's in the millions. Excuse me. Let's go past this for a second. What was it that the arresting agent said or did that showed the animus -- meaning that because that another officer actually saw it and understood himself what he thought, doesn't mean that this agent who was told that there had been a touching had that information. So I know collective knowledge is a theory in a lot of cases, but let's deal with the facts of this case. What's -- what's the animus? How does all of that prove your point of animus in light of the undisputed fact that he lied about touching the Vice President? And that's the-- --You do understand that this case is inviting the questions the Chief Justice asked, which, and which has -- Justice Breyer and some of us are concerned about, which is what your adversary has described as First Amendment voicing is going to be a part of many, many arrests. How do we draw a line outside of the one that you proposed by your adversaries, that probable cause is the line. That doesn't enmesh the police in a constant barrage of claims that just because they angered a police officer, that's why they were arrested. ",counsel that that be exactly what justice breyer be say okay which be as i understand it there be some literature that talk about should we be treat misdemeanor arrest different than felony arrest because there be less discretion that an officer would have with respect to arrest someone for a felony than for misdemeanor or criminal fine because like jaywalking policeman do not arrest you for jaywalk unless they be either on a ticket binge or because there be something about you that they do not like so if that something about you they do not like be that you be wear an antiwar armband be we go to let that plaintiff not recover because somehow we need to protect police officer so much in the discretionary use of this vast power they have to arrest that we be go to permit them to trample the first amendment essentially or be we go to say in the normal situation there be a first amendment claim even with probable because if you can prove that it be the motivate factor for the arrest but we treat secret service differently and i think that be the point justice breyer s get to and the one I be most interested in if you be jaywalk there be probable because but but what do it have to do with violate the first amendment mean if police officer have discretion and they would not otherwise arrest you except for their dislike of your speech that be a violation of your right to free speech be not it we can go to that question later do you have a sense of how many of these first amendment retaliatory claim in those jurisdiction that permit them i know they be more limited how many of these case arise and how many arrest be there a year I be sure it be in the million excuse me let us go past this for a second what be it that the arresting agent say or do that show the animus meaning that because that another officer actually saw it and understand himself what he think do not mean that this agent who be tell that there have be a touching have that information so i know collective knowledge be a theory in a lot of case but let us deal with the fact of this case what be what be the animus how do all of that prove your point of animus in light of the undisputed fact that he lie about touch the vice president and that be the you do understand that this case be invite the question the chief justice ask which and which have justice breyer and some of us be concerned about which be what your adversary have describe as first amendment voicing be go to be a part of many many arrest how do we draw a line outside of the one that you propose by your adversary that probable because be the line that do not enmesh the police in a constant barrage of claim that just because they anger a police officer that be why they we be arrest ,208.66,Roberts Court,"Mar 21, 2012","Virgil D.

2011,Maples v. Thomas,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"--you are begging the question, which is how is the clerk supposed to know this? This is a functionary in the clerk's office who sends out notices, receives back mail that's not returned. There has to be some local counsel that does work. How is he supposed to know the difference between those that do, and those that don't? Mr. Garre, I have two questions for you. Is that -- is this State the only one that doesn't appoint counsel in a post-conviction capital case? But the vast majority do? In capital cases. All right. Number two, I thought there were two questions in this, in this part of your case. The first is, don't we have to decide that abandonment, which you have termed, is cause-- --in a -- to excuse a procedural bar in a State court. So we have to decide first whether we extend Holland to this setting. That's the due process. I'm talking about -- yes, both we would have to decide. But assuming -- we have to decide the first question. Will we extend Holland to this type of situation. Yes, I understand. Yes. Mr. Garre, we don't know, we don't know. Isn't that just proof that if we were to find that Holland applied, the Holland exception applied, that we would have to remand this case? In that regard, there is one part of Holland that you don't really address, which is that Holland contrasted a statute of limitations issue with respect to access to a Federal court with a procedural bar and said that the State's procedural bar had interest of federalism, that we had to be cautious of ignoring a State procedural bar because of federalism. If we were to extend Holland in the way you want, how do we justify ignoring federalism in that situation? Is that surprising? I think Justice Kennedy asked your adversary: How often do appeals lie from the denial of State post-conviction remedies? In a capital case. Counsel, could we go back to the Chief Justice's initial question? Let's assume the two letters went to Sullivan & Cromwell and came back, ""left firm"", as they did, and that the letter to Butler came back ""deceased"". Would there be cause in that situation to excuse the State's procedural ground? Well, we know that both lawyers in this case didn't move to another firm. Both of them took jobs that precluded them from representing this defendant. So I don't know how I define abandonment other than I take a job where I can't work for you anymore. So he had figured out that something had terminated the relationship between Mr. Maples and his lawyers? Well-- --Counsel, could you tell me -- I'm assuming you have practiced in your State for a while. How frequent is it in the Alabama capital system that local counsel takes the laboring oar, or even an active participation in the defense or actions of a capital defendant? Your -- the amici here says generally they did what Mr. Butler did, they just facilitated the -- the admission of the volunteer attorneys. Was that your experience? I guess the problem is, accept the rule; it exists. But if a lawyer says, ""I don't care, I'm not going to do whatever the rules require me to do. "" what more do you need for abandonment? If a lawyer comes in and says, ""I understand this is a rule of the court. "" ""I understand that I'm supposed to do x, y, and z. "" ""I don't care. "" ""I'm just not. "" that's the question. What's the difference between ""I don't care"" and abandonment? We are not talking about the notice issue, we are talking about the abandonment question.

It says anybody born in -- in Jerusalem can have Israel listed, correct? What happens if there is a peace accord tomorrow, and Israel gives up any claim to sovereignty over Jerusalem? Is the President free to stop listing Israel on the passport? Or does he have to wait for Congress to change the law? So you are hobbling the President with respect to situations that occur frequently-- --as happened in Egypt, sometimes overnight. The Constitution requires ambassadors to be appointed with the consent of the Senate. It gives Congress the power of the purse. So why don't -- why isn't the better view that we let Congress express its approval and disapproval in the mechanism set up by the Constitution to do so? Meaning, if the President recognizes a country that Congress doesn't want it to recognize, it can withhold approval of an ambassador, it could refuse to fund the embassy. It could do many other things. But what entitles Congress to trench on a presidential power that has been exercised virtually since the beginning of the country? General, what is-- --General-- --General, the -- the tension that I see here, and I think it's what Justice Breyer's getting at, is the label's important, because if we call this a political question and don't address the merits, the outcome is that the President is saying that he's entitled to ignore the Congress. I don't know what kind of message that sends, but it's a little unsettling that a Court charged with enforcing the laws passed by Congress are basically saying we are not going to determine whether this law is constitutional or unconstitutional. That's what your definition of political question is becoming, and where does that stop? In what situations? Only in foreign policy do we decide not to-- --But that's not what the D.C. Circuit did. Could you tell me -- let's assume that a dozen nations said this designation on the passport as we view is an act of war.

2011,Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. EEOC,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, most of the circuits have recognized a ministerial exception. But they've in one form or another created a pretext exception. The reason for that is the situation that troubles me. How about a teacher who reports sexual abuse to the government and is fired because of that reporting? Now, we know from the news recently that there was a church whose religious beliefs centered around sexually exploiting women and I believe children. Regardless of whether it's a religious belief or not, doesn't society have a right at some point to say certain conduct is unacceptable, even if religious -- smoking peyote? And once we say that's unacceptable, can and why shouldn't we protect the people who are doing what the law requires, i.e. reporting it? So how do we deal with that situation under your theory? Under your theory, nothing survives if the individual is a minister, no claim, private claim. The problem with that is that it doesn't take account of the societal interest in encouraging the reporting. And in fact, if we -- if we define the ministerial exception in the way you want, we take away the incentive for reporting; we actually do the opposite of what society needs. How? Give me a theoretical framework for this? I'm sorry. Going back to the question Justice Kagan asked you, if one of these Protestant teachers that's not Lutheran led the cafeteria prayer, as they are required to, you're now saying that the law must recognize that lay teacher as a minister and apply the ministerial exception, even though the religion doesn't consider her a minister? Well, but that was the answer you gave. If she taught a religious class-- --What is your definition of minister? Maybe we need to find out. So it's not a title. It's really -- the only function, you're saying anyone who teaches religion? Mr. Laycock, I'm not sure why the status of the individual matters under your theory. It seems to me what you're saying is, so long as a religious organization gives a religious reason of any kind, genuine or not, for firing someone that's associated with it, whether minister or not, that that invokes the exception. Am I hearing your argument right? All right. So why is there a difference? So you would say with janitors, you can get into the pretext question. So you're limiting your test to whether that person is minister. So define minister for me again. ",counsel most of the circuit have recognize a ministerial exception but they have in one form or another create a pretext exception the reason for that be the situation that trouble me how about a teacher who report sexual abuse to the government and be fire because of that reporting now we know from the news recently that there be a church whose religious belief center around sexually exploit woman and i believe child regardless of whether it be a religious belief or not do not society have a right at some point to say certain conduct be unacceptable even if religious smoke peyote and once we say that be unacceptable can and why should not we protect the people who be do what the law require ie report it so how do we deal with that situation under your theory under your theory nothing survives if the individual be a minister no claim private claim the problem with that be that it do not take account of the societal interest in encourage the reporting and in fact if we if we define the ministerial exception in the way you want we take away the incentive for report we actually do the opposite of what society need how give me a theoretical framework for this I be sorry go back to the question justice kagan ask you if one of these protestant teacher that be not lutheran lead the cafeteria prayer as they be require to you be now say that the law must recognize that lay teacher as a minister and apply the ministerial exception even though the religion do not consider her a minister well but that be the answer you give if she teach a religious class what be your definition of minister maybe we need to find out so it be not a title it be really the only function you be say anyone who teach religion mr laycock I be not sure why the status of the individual matter under your theory it seem to me what you be say be so long as a religious organization give a religious reason of any kind genuine or not for fire someone that be associate with it whether minister or not that that invoke the exception be i hear your argument right all right so why be there a difference so you would say with janitor you can get into the pretext question so you be limit your test to whether that person be minister so define minister for me again ,199.41000000000003,Roberts Court,"Oct 5, 2011",Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School,"Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, et al.",10-553,"Mar 28, 2011","Jan 11, 2012",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2011,Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of the County of Burlington,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Sorry. Are you suggesting -- three different levels. Stripping naked: It's okay to stand 5 feet away, but not 2? All right. So are you -- are you taking the position that it's the purpose of the search-- --that -- that's at issue? I'm still unsure. If it's okay to shower-- --and have an officer watch you shower naked-- --what is the greater intrusion is that you are standing 2 as opposed to 5 feet away? That is a line that doesn't make much sense to me. Then let's go to the next line, which is -- that's one kind of search. The second is I think what some have called a visual cavity search. Whether you are going to have the individual open or expose private parts. Can you make an argument that that is different than just a visual search? Counsel-- --Could you clarify two points for me? The first is, was he admitted into the general population at Burlington? The prior charge against your client was the use -- involved the use of a deadly weapon. Assuming the prison knew this, wouldn't that provide the reasonable suspicion that you argue was missing? So now you are -- you are feeding into your adversary's argument that what you are asking the police to do on intake, or the corrections facility on intake, is to investigate in that fine detail? They can't even look at the rap sheet-- --and see use of a deadly weapon and say, ah, this guy could be dangerous? So why do we change the policy? In Bell we found that the policy was successful. Even though there were searches, contraband still got in. So virtually every circuit in practice in the Federal system have been following this reasonable suspicion for minor crimes and they have been fairly successful. So why do we change the constitutional rule to let them do more? To invade more. I understand contraband is serious. But most of the studies point to it not being on intake, but coming in through guards, coming in through contact visits. The great cause today is that from corrupt correction officials. Counsel, could I ask you something just in terms of your rule. I think your brief says your rule is you are not entitled constitutionally to any right of privacy in prison. If that's the case, are you saying that if the prisons decide on a manual search, every prisoner who comes in, correction officers can manually check their cavities? So there is some privacy rule there? Can we go back to Justice Alito's question? Isn't one of the factors that we look at under the Fourth Amendment reasonableness? And should we be thinking about the fact that many of these people who are now being arrested are being put into general populations or into jails, sometimes not just overnight but for longer periods of time, like this gentleman, for 6 days before he sees a magistrate? Should we be considering a rule that basically says your right to search someone depends on whether that individual has in fact been arrested for a crime that's going to lead to jail time or not, whether that person's been presented to a magistrate to see whether there is in fact probable cause for the arrest and detention of this individual? I mean, there is something unsettling about permitting the police to arrest people for things, like kids who are staying out after curfew with no other, based on probably nothing else. But what are we doing with the presumption of innocence? That's also a constitutional right. And so shouldn't the degree to which a search is permitted be conditioned in some way on whether or not this person has been presented to a magistrate? Sure. Mr. Phillips-- The issue has to be certainly some misdemeanor. Some people charged with misdemeanor crimes will try to smuggle things in. The issue is how many of them would not have been found on a reasonable suspicion standard. I think Justice Breyer said in the San Francisco study it appears only one. But we don't have 20/20. We have how many years, 15 years since Bell where prisons have been applying the reasonable suspicion standard. And the most you could muster under that standard is one example of a case where someone has entered? At some point empirical evidence has to mean something in terms of us judging the question of reasonableness. I don't have a question about that today. I know it's bad to base your judgments on your own personal experiences. When I was a prosecutor, it took sometimes days to get a rap sheet. I understand that that's no longer the case today? That there virtually almost always accessible by computers today? ",sorry be you suggest three different level strip naked it be okay to stand foot away but not all right so be you be you take the position that it be the purpose of the search that that be at issue I be still unsure if it be okay to shower and have an officer watch you shower naked what be the great intrusion be that you be stand as oppose to foot away that be a line that do not make much sense to me then let us go to the next line which be that be one kind of search the second be i think what some have call a visual cavity search whether you be go to have the individual open or expose private part can you make an argument that that be different than just a visual search counsel could you clarify two point for me the first be be he admit into the general population at burlington the prior charge against your client be the use involve the use of a deadly weapon assume the prison know this would not that provide the reasonable suspicion that you argue be miss so now you be you be feed into your adversary s argument that what you be ask the police to do on intake or the correction facility on intake be to investigate in that fine detail they can not even look at the rap sheet and see use of a deadly weapon and say ah this guy could be dangerous so why do we change the policy in bell we find that the policy be successful even though there we be search contraband still get in so virtually every circuit in practice in the federal system have be follow this reasonable suspicion for minor crime and they have be fairly successful so why do we change the constitutional rule to let them do more to invade more i understand contraband be serious but most of the study point to it not be on intake but come in through guard come in through contact visit the great because today be that from corrupt correction official counsel could i ask you something just in term of your rule i think your brief say your rule be you be not entitle constitutionally to any right of privacy in prison if that be the case be you say that if the prison decide on a manual search every prisoner who come in correction officer can manually check their cavity so there be some privacy rule there can we go back to justice alito s question be not one of the factor that we look at under the fourth amendment reasonableness and should we be think about the fact that many of these people who be now be arrest be be put into general population or into jail sometimes not just overnight but for long period of time like this gentleman for day before he see a magistrate should we be consider a rule that basically say your right to search someone depend on whether that individual have in fact be arrest for a crime that be go to lead to jail time or not whether that person s be present to a magistrate to see whether there be in fact probable because for the arrest and detention of this individual i mean there be something unsettle about permit the police to arrest people for thing like kid who be stay out after curfew with no other base on probably nothing else but what be we do with the presumption of innocence that be also a constitutional right and so should not the degree to which a search be permit be condition in some way on whether or not this person have be present to a magistrate sure mr phillips the issue have to be certainly some misdemeanor some people charge with misdemeanor crime will try to smuggle thing in the issue be how many of them would not have be find on a reasonable suspicion standard i think justice breyer say in the san francisco study it appear only one but we do not have we have how many year year since bell where prison have be apply the reasonable suspicion standard and the most you could muster under that standard be one example of a case where someone have enter at some point empirical evidence have to mean something in term of us judge the question of reasonableness i do not have a question about that today i know it be bad to base your judgment on your own personal experience when i be a prosecutor it take sometimes day to get a rap sheet i understand that that be no longer the case today that there virtually almost always accessible by computer today ,319.6500000000001,Roberts Court,"Oct 12, 2011",Albert W.

2011,National Meat Association v. Harris,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"So your -- your position is if the contract for purchase is consummated in some way on premises, that's preempted? And so your answer to Justice Kagan and Justice Scalia is that if the purchase contract occurs before the animals arrive at the gate of the slaughterhouse, that that would not be preempted? Well, your whole argument is on express preemption. You've given up any argument on implied. Please tell me why you think the sale of the meat is expressly preempted? The Solicitor General says it's a closer question on sale of the meat because the slaughterhouse processes -- the law is involved only with the operations and -- of the premises and manner of slaughtering. It has nothing to do with sales. So why is the sale of the meat preempted? So how about there is a law that says you can't slaughter cats, dogs or horses, or you can't sell cats, horse -- dogs or horses for slaughter? Or for consumption. Is that preempted? There is a Federal regulation to that effect? Can you tell me, if it's okay for California to say you can't sell a nonambulatory animal, and that that applies to everyone off the slaughterhouse premises, is that -- that's basically your position. So that if the purchase occurs on premises, then the person who is selling it, even if it's not the slaughterhouse, can still sell it on the premises? What a -- what a fascinating area of immunity. Now what we're saying to auction houses and everyone else is don't pass title until you get to the slaughterhouse. Who defines the scope? All right. So now explain how under your definition it's not among at least one of those? I understood that the Federal regulation -- you can correct me if I'm misunderstanding -- is that if there is a suspect animal of any kind that it requires a slaughterhouse to wait until the Federal inspector comes and finds out whether it's just suspect or it's something that can't be sold. And the reason why the inspection occurs as I understand it is that there are some diseases that are so contagious that if the inspector decides that that animal is carrying that disease that the whole lot will be quarantined or otherwise destroyed. So are you fighting with -- that that's what the purpose of pre-inspection under the Federal system is for? I'm having a hard time drawing that distinction. If there is a valid purpose to the pre-mortem inspection -- and I can't see how you can argue otherwise -- that there may be some diseases that are so contagious that the entire lot, ambulatory or nonambulatory swine, are affected, then I don't see how you can argue that you aren't trenching on the scope of the statute. If the scope of the statute is to ensure that meat is unadulterated and if there is the risk of contagion, that has to be within the scope. But you define the scope almost exclusively by purpose and regulatory power is broader than purpose. I mean, as is reflected by the regulations here which are dealing not merely with animals that are adulterated, but are dealing with the whole process of what happens from the minute they arrive to the minute they are sold. So if we don't accept your limitation based on a scope being defined by purpose, how do you win? Well, you seem to be assuming that in effecting its obligations that only when it finds adulterated meat is that within the scope. The government has basically said: We have got to figure out if it is and this is how we are going to do it: We are going to do it starting from the receipt of the swine through its sale, and we are going to have inspections all through the process, whether or not the meat will ultimately be sold or not; our scope is what happens in that slaughterhouse. That-- --I'm sorry; you're not seriously arguing that the Secretary couldn't regulate in the manner California has? That the Secretary is powerless under this Act to say you can't slaughter animals that can't walk? The Secretary could do that? ",so your your position be if the contract for purchase be consummate in some way on premise that be preempt and so your answer to justice kagan and justice scalia be that if the purchase contract occur before the animal arrive at the gate of the slaughterhouse that that would not be preempt well your whole argument be on express preemption you have give up any argument on imply please tell me why you think the sale of the meat be expressly preempt the solicitor general say it be a close question on sale of the meat because the slaughterhouse process the law be involve only with the operation and of the premise and manner of slaughtering it have nothing to do with sale so why be the sale of the meat preempt so how about there be a law that say you can not slaughter cat dog or horse or you can not sell cat horse dog or horse for slaughter or for consumption be that preempt there be a federal regulation to that effect can you tell me if it be okay for california to say you can not sell a nonambulatory animal and that that apply to everyone off the slaughterhouse premise be that that be basically your position so that if the purchase occur on premise then the person who be sell it even if it be not the slaughterhouse can still sell it on the premise what a what a fascinating area of immunity now what we be say to auction house and everyone else be do not pass title until you get to the slaughterhouse who define the scope all right so now explain how under your definition it be not among at least one of those i understand that the federal regulation you can correct me if I be misunderstand be that if there be a suspect animal of any kind that it require a slaughterhouse to wait until the federal inspector come and find out whether it be just suspect or it be something that can not be sell and the reason why the inspection occur as i understand it be that there be some disease that be so contagious that if the inspector decide that that animal be carry that disease that the whole lot will be quarantine or otherwise destroy so be you fight with that that be what the purpose of pre inspection under the federal system be for I be have a hard time draw that distinction if there be a valid purpose to the pre mortem inspection and i can not see how you can argue otherwise that there may be some disease that be so contagious that the entire lot ambulatory or nonambulatory swine be affect then i do not see how you can argue that you be not trench on the scope of the statute if the scope of the statute be to ensure that meat be unadulterated and if there be the risk of contagion that have to be within the scope but you define the scope almost exclusively by purpose and regulatory power be broad than purpose i mean as be reflect by the regulation here which be deal not merely with animal that be adulterate but be deal with the whole process of what happen from the minute they arrive to the minute they be sell so if we do not accept your limitation base on a scope be define by purpose how do you win well you seem to be assume that in effect its obligation that only when it find adulterated meat be that within the scope the government have basically say we have get to figure out if it be and this be how we be go to do it we be go to do it start from the receipt of the swine through its sale and we be go to have inspection all through the process whether or not the meat will ultimately be sell or not our scope be what happen in that slaughterhouse that I be sorry you be not seriously argue that the secretary could not regulate in the manner california have that the secretary be powerless under this act to say you can not slaughter animal that can not walk the secretary could do that ,316.37000000000006,Roberts Court,"Nov 9, 2011",National Meat Association,"Kamala D.

2011,Smith v. Cain,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counselor-- --Counselor, your argument now and in your brief suggests that you're relying most heavily on the failure to provide the impeachment materials of the only witness to this crime and the only piece of evidence that ties your client to the crime. But you also mention other things, and Respondents spend 90 percent of their brief arguing against the other things. But I just want to clarify those other things. Number one, was the testimony mixed testimony about whether the assailants wore a mask across their face or over their entire head? What's the best take on what the evidence showed that was presented on that issue? Could I ask you something? Who determines that issue of whether that's a dying declaration? Do we determine that in deciding whether the withholding of the Brady materials was harmful or not? Do we give deference to the lower court's determination of that? Do they have to decide whether it was a dying declaration. What's the standard on something like this? Now, Mr. Mims was the neighbor who saw the two -- there were three assailants in total, right, and two left the scene? Am I right that this-- --Counsel, is -- this group or gang, all of them had gold teeth and faded hair cuts? In short, faded hair cuts and gold teeth were not a unique characteristic. I'd just like to go back to that because I'm not sure that I understand the argument. Both the ballistics expert at trial said that the casings were consistent with a 9-millimeter, and I know that Boatner said that it was a 9-millimeter that was used, and the issue was whether anybody would call a MAC gun a handgun as opposed to an automatic pistol, correct? Could you tell me why Boatner waited 2 weeks to -- or never told the police that the face that he saw in the newspaper was the face of his assailant? I -- I -- as I understand the facts, he says he saw the newspaper, recognized his assailant and remained silent. It wasn't until they presented him with the line-up including Mr. Smith's face that he identified Mr. Smith. What's the reason for the delay? And so what turned -- what changed his mind once police showed him the line-up. What if-- --what if -- could the jury be entitled to reject that conclusion? They have four statements by this man who Ronquillo described as very coherent, very with it at the scene of the crime. Would a jury be entitled to -- to reject that excuse by Ronquillo? And if they were entitled to do that, why would the absence of four statements that I can't identify someone not have been an argument that defense counsel could have used, number one, and that have a reasonable probability of making a difference? At different hours. At different hours. And to different officers. So that's two statements. My math is wrong? But you have -- you have to supply statements by a witness when they take the stand, don't you? Those are immaterial? Don't you have to turn over-- --not in the State of Louisiana? You don't have to turn over witness statements when they are taking the stand? So you are -- so are you claiming that the judge's failure to catch these inconsistencies excuses your Brady obligation? So is there a violation under our holding in Kyles? Is there a Brady violation under our holding in Kyles? So explain why what is on its face seemingly inconsistent statements are not required to be turned over. I don't understand how he becomes the arbiter of what's Brady. You said to me earlier that a jury would be entitled to reject his conclusion. All right. Tell me what -- how his conclusion makes it non-Brady if a juror could decide differently. The two components to Brady, should they have been turned over? And if they had, is there a reasonable probability of a different outcome? Should they have been turned over? That's the question that I think my colleague asked you, and you're saying no. All right, now articulate what legal theory-- --would say these are not, these are not materials that needed to be turned over, when they say ""could not ID; would not know them if I saw them; can't tell if had faces covered; didn't see anyone. "" That's one of the notes. The other one, ""I don't know how many that I saw; I was too scared to look at anybody. "" And-- What makes any of those statements-- --This is all the jury argument. Tell me why they didn't on their face constitute Brady materials that needed to be turned over. What's the legal principle that doesn't make them Brady? Counsel, my worry is the following. You've read Cullen-- --You read Cullen. You read the dissent in Cullen. There has been serious accusations against the practices of your office, not yours in particular but prior ones. It is disconcerting to me that when I asked you the question directly should this material have been turned over, you gave an absolute no. It didn't need to be. It would have been prudent, but it didn't need to be. That's really troubling. That's the second prong of Brady. I said there were two prongs to Brady. Do you have to turn it over, and second, does it cause harm. And the first one you said not. That -- it is somewhat disconcerting that your office is still answering equivocally on a basic obligation as one that requires you to have turned these materials over-- --whether it caused harm or not.

2012,Bailey v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, the two tests, yours seem to be the immediate vicinity test, and the Second Circuit is as soon as practical test. Your adversaries point out that the Second Circuit test actually focuses on the police officer's conduct, which should be the focus of reasonableness or unreasonableness. Your test just creates an artificial line that is subject to as much play as the other. Why isn't the focus on police conduct the right focus? Counsel, can I come back to the facts that my colleagues have raised and break it down implicating the Terry question? Here, the officers had a report of something in the house, and they saw the defendant -- two people leaving. I know Terry hasn't been decided, but why do you think -- just the stop, not the detention, not the bringing them back to the house, why do you think that just stopping them was wrong? Under Terry. But the court below did. Well, it goes back to if a police officer saw an individual leaving the house and was concerned about them tipping someone off, et cetera, what would be the problem with the officer stopping the person around the corner, holding them, making sure people got in and then letting them go. I thought your better answer was the risk of somebody coming back to a house exists whether the person just left it or left it an hour after or before or 2 hours or 24. When the police walk in, they always have to guard against reentry. Mr. Wall, would you answer -- direct your first response to that last issue because, as I read your brief, you seem not to be accepting the Second Circuit's rule at all. You seem to be proposing what appears to me to be a much broader rule that says -- at one point in your brief you state that it is the occupant's observed connection to a home subject to a valid warrant, not his physical location at the time that he is detained, that makes him subject to detention. Now, I know police when they're executing warrants often have an advance team that has been surveilling a home, sometimes for days. And they've got one officer sitting there, and they see who they think is the occupant leave, and the team doesn't arrive till 12 hours later. Is it your position that in that circumstance the officers are authorized to go to wherever the defend -- wherever the occupant is, the office, the -- wherever he might be, his mother's home, and effect an arrest there? You're missing the point, which is that's going to happen regardless, meaning that risk exists whether the person left the minute you got there or a minute before or an hour before or two hours before. That's the whole point, which is the risk is extant no matter what. But you didn't know -- you don't know that in any search, meaning any time you do a search you have no idea when the -- whether the occupant -- sometimes you know whether the occupant is inside. You'll hear the TV or something else. But often you don't, and you don't know if someone will come back and when. So why is seeing someone leaving increasing that risk? Can you tell me what constitutional right entitles you to stop someone from, using the word, “ fleeing ”? You certainly are entitled to stop someone with whom you have reasonable suspicion. But what constitutional right entitles you to stop a person who's just leaving in the normal act, without reasonable suspicion? Counsel-- --Counsel, the problem with absolute rules like we did in Summers is that they're an exception, and they're absolute. Go back to the question you were asked by one of my colleagues earlier, why wouldn't Terry give you all of the rights that you're seeking on the absolute rule, but subject your police conduct to the question of reasonableness, which is the normal standard of the Fourth Amendment? I'm -- I'm litigating for you. So I could very easily imagine that what the fight's going to be like below is, we stopped them because we saw them coming out of the house, and all we want to do is make sure that they don't return. So we're just going to hold them in place. We don't have to drag them in a car back to a place they just left. We're just going to stop them in place to get a phone call that everything's all clear. Well, we don't know, but why don't we let that develop. Counsel, my -- I remain with my question, which is, we have a circumstance-driven power of Terry. Your power is really going much more broadly, because you're basically saying if that -- if probable cause exists to search a premise, it exists without being tied to an individual because anybody who leaves the house, whether or not they have been tied to a crime in that house in the past or not, is now subject to being detained. So we have evidence that only a husband is involved in a fraud, and his wife is leaving for work. Because she was observed leaving the house, she can now be stopped a mile away. So your -- your view is that Summers gave you -- entitled you to hold people merely for purposes of investigation-- --without any reasonable suspicion? That's really what your rule is saying. ",counsel the two test yours seem to be the immediate vicinity test and the second circuit be as soon as practical test your adversary point out that the second circuit test actually focus on the police officer s conduct which should be the focus of reasonableness or unreasonableness your test just create an artificial line that be subject to as much play as the other why be not the focus on police conduct the right focus counsel can i come back to the fact that my colleague have raise and break it down implicate the terry question here the officer have a report of something in the house and they saw the defendant two people leave i know terry have not be decide but why do you think just the stop not the detention not the bring them back to the house why do you think that just stop them be wrong under terry but the court below do well it go back to if a police officer saw an individual leave the house and be concern about them tip someone off et cetera what would be the problem with the officer stop the person around the corner hold them make sure people get in and then let them go i think your good answer be the risk of somebody come back to a house exist whether the person just leave it or leave it an hour after or before or hour or when the police walk in they always have to guard against reentry mr wall would you answer direct your first response to that last issue because as i read your brief you seem not to be accept the second circuit s rule at all you seem to be propose what appear to me to be a much broad rule that say at one point in your brief you state that it be the occupant s observed connection to a home subject to a valid warrant not his physical location at the time that he be detain that make him subject to detention now i know police when they be execute warrant often have an advance team that have be surveilling a home sometimes for day and they have get one officer sit there and they see who they think be the occupant leave and the team do not arrive till hour later be it your position that in that circumstance the officer be authorize to go to wherever the defend wherever the occupant be the office the wherever he might be his mother s home and effect an arrest there you be miss the point which be that be go to happen regardless mean that risk exist whether the person leave the minute you get there or a minute before or an hour before or two hour before that be the whole point which be the risk be extant no matter what but you do not know you do not know that in any search mean any time you do a search you have no idea when the whether the occupant sometimes you know whether the occupant be inside you will hear the tv or something else but often you do not and you do not know if someone will come back and when so why be see someone leave increase that risk can you tell me what constitutional right entitle you to stop someone from use the word flee you certainly be entitle to stop someone with whom you have reasonable suspicion but what constitutional right entitle you to stop a person who be just leave in the normal act without reasonable suspicion counsel counsel the problem with absolute rule like we do in summer be that they be an exception and they be absolute go back to the question you we be ask by one of my colleague earlier why would not terry give you all of the right that you be seek on the absolute rule but subject your police conduct to the question of reasonableness which be the normal standard of the fourth amendment I be I be litigate for you so i could very easily imagine that what the fight s go to be like below be we stop them because we saw them come out of the house and all we want to do be make sure that they do not return so we be just go to hold them in place we do not have to drag them in a car back to a place they just leave we be just go to stop them in place to get a phone call that everything s all clear well we do not know but why do not we let that develop counsel my i remain with my question which be we have a circumstance driven power of terry your power be really go much more broadly because you be basically say if that if probable because exists to search a premise it exist without be tie to an individual because anybody who leave the house whether or not they have be tie to a crime in that house in the past or not be now subject to be detain so we have evidence that only a husband be involve in a fraud and his wife be leave for work because she be observe leave the house she can now be stop a mile away so your your view be that summer give you entitle you to hold people merely for purpose of investigation without any reasonable suspicion that be really what your rule be say ,378.1299999999998,Roberts Court,"Nov 1, 2012",Chunon L.

2012,United States v. Bormes,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Under your view, is there any situation today where the Tucker Act would be applied to a statute? Because if we start with the statute, which always seems to be where you're pointing us to, and we're only looking for a clear waiver of sovereign immunity, then there will never be another Tucker Act action in the future. What would they look like to be able to get around our clear statement rule? So basically -- I'm not sure why we're even addressing the issue of Tucker Act jurisdiction. We should have really just been briefing the issue of whether the statute at issue here waives sovereign immunity-- --because that becomes, to you, the operative question. Could I ask you-- --I was going to ask -- following up on my question-- --many courts have held that the FLSA has an express waiver of sovereign immunity. And many of them have recognized, if not all, a Tucker Act remedy. Under your new approach, that holding is incorrect, I presume-- --because the FLSA has its own remedial scheme? But then the Federal circuit has no jurisdiction over those claims, according to you, because the waiver is in the FLSA, it has its own judicial remedy. They are not authorized, then, to go to-- --It has the same language as here, in -- you can bring your suit in any Federal or state court of competent jurisdiction. I don't know -- I don't see the difference between-- --That's exactly what I started with. That's what I started with: Is there anything left to the Tucker Act? So the new rule is if a statute is written to impose obligations only on the government, then the Tucker Act is implicated immediately. If the rule says the government and any party who contracts with it -- a Medicaid provider -- must do X, Y, and Z, and the government and the Medicaid provider have the burdens of accomplishing Y, unless there is an express waiver of sovereign immunity, the Tucker Act doesn't come into play. That's your position. Well, you are not going to suggest that if the scheme I just described says X, Y, and Z, have to do all these things, and someone to whom they owe that obligation can sue the Medicaid provider, for example, for breach of that obligation, presumably -- I'm putting in a lot of hypotheticals given our case law -- but you're saying they can't sue the government under the Tucker Act-- --unless there is an express waiver. Counsel, this sort of begs the question-- --the statute awards damages for breach of the obligation, so it's money mandating. The issue is not whether it's money mandating; the question is who is it mandating. But there is not an issue of whether it contemplates the payment of damages. It expressly awards-- --I -- it is -- there is some difficulty with your argument, which is, going back to my simplified hypothetical, government and Medicaid -- X providers have to do X, Y, and Z; if those persons, being defined as government and providers, doesn't do what they have to do, they have to pay these damages. I mean, that's pretty clear. So are you happy with the circuit's suggestion that the specific does govern the general insofar as it will adopt whatever FCRA's limitations are? And into its own processes? Your position is that's perfectly okay. One of the purposes of the Tucker Act was to provide a remedy, where none existed, to get rid of the private bills. What's wrong with the government's basic proposition which is where you have a remedy you have to pursue that remedy. And I think that, at bottom, that's their argument. What's wrong with that scheme? Instead of permitting two remedies with potentially conflicting commands, whether it's on the amount of damages or the nature of the recovery or the statute of limitations, why isn't their vision of what the Tucker Act -- the role the Tucker Act should play one that should be given voice? One that should be followed? The FSLA as well. The FSLA as well. ",under your view be there any situation today where the tucker act would be apply to a statute because if we start with the statute which always seem to be where you be point us to and we be only look for a clear waiver of sovereign immunity then there will never be another tucker act action in the future what would they look like to be able to get around our clear statement rule so basically I be not sure why we be even address the issue of tucker act jurisdiction we should have really just be brief the issue of whether the statute at issue here waive sovereign immunity because that become to you the operative question could i ask you i be go to ask follow up on my question many court have hold that the flsa have an express waiver of sovereign immunity and many of them have recognize if not all a tucker act remedy under your new approach that hold be incorrect i presume because the flsa have its own remedial scheme but then the federal circuit have no jurisdiction over those claim accord to you because the waiver be in the flsa it have its own judicial remedy they be not authorize then to go to it have the same language as here in you can bring your suit in any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction i do not know i do not see the difference between that be exactly what i start with that be what i start with be there anything leave to the tucker act so the new rule be if a statute be write to impose obligation only on the government then the tucker act be implicate immediately if the rule say the government and any party who contract with it a medicaid provider must do x y and z and the government and the medicaid provider have the burden of accomplish y unless there be an express waiver of sovereign immunity the tucker act do not come into play that be your position well you be not go to suggest that if the scheme i just describe say x y and z have to do all these thing and someone to whom they owe that obligation can sue the medicaid provider for example for breach of that obligation presumably I be put in a lot of hypothetical give our case law but you be say they can not sue the government under the tucker act unless there be an express waiver counsel this sort of begs the question the statute award damage for breach of the obligation so it be money mandating the issue be not whether it be money mandate the question be who be it mandate but there be not an issue of whether it contemplate the payment of damage it expressly award i it be there be some difficulty with your argument which be go back to my simplified hypothetical government and medicaid x provider have to do x y and z if those person be define as government and provider do not do what they have to do they have to pay these damage i mean that be pretty clear so be you happy with the circuit s suggestion that the specific do govern the general insofar as it will adopt whatever fcra s limitation be and into its own process your position be that be perfectly okay one of the purpose of the tucker act be to provide a remedy where none exist to get rid of the private bill what be wrong with the government s basic proposition which be where you have a remedy you have to pursue that remedy and i think that at bottom that be their argument what be wrong with that scheme instead of permit two remedy with potentially conflict command whether it be on the amount of damage or the nature of the recovery or the statute of limitation why be not their vision of what the tucker act the role the tucker act should play one that should be give voice one that should be follow the fsla as well the fsla as well ,280.23,Roberts Court,"Oct 2, 2012",United States,James X.

2012,Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Are you suggesting -- I don't know that the parties -- I know that the Government has said that (f) doesn't apply to the father, but (d) does, so there's not a full concession on your point. But putting that aside, if it is a father who has visitation rights, and exercising all of his support obligations, is it your position that -- that because that father's not a custodian, he has no protections whatsoever under (d) or (e)? The State can come and take the child away from an unfit mother or father if they're the ones with custody, and that responsible parent who only has visiting rights has no protections under (d), (e), or (f)? I'm not asking about State law-- --I'm asking about Federal law. Well, (d) doesn't talk about custodial rights. I do agree that (f) talks about continued-- --custody. Well, you don't think that a parent with custody -- well, you do think a parent with custody is the only definition of family, but why wouldn't a noncustodial parent with visitation rights be considered a family with that child? I'm not going to State law-- --Well, there is a support obligation on that unwed father. Why isn't that a parental right? It's one of the parental rights the States enforce whether or not you want to provide support or not. So what do you do with the States that do give unwed fathers that don't support their children and who don't have an ongoing relationship the right to be considered first for adoption? Why should we follow the definitions of South Carolina or those other States? Why shouldn't we just give it a Federal meaning? As-- --What's the difference with a sperm donor? I mean, I know that you raise that in your brief. But, going back to Justice Scalia's point, if the choice is between a mother, a biological father, or a stranger, and if the father's fit, why do you think that the Federal statute requires that it be given to a stranger rather than to the biological father when the statute defines “ parent ” as the biological father? What do you do with the lower court's determination that one of the factors of the best interest calculus was the Federal policy to ensure that Indian children, children of biological Indian parents, at least one, should be raised with their parents? Because the lower court said it thought it was in the best interest of this child to stay with its birth father in light of the Federal policy. So I disagree with your colleague that there wasn't a best interest-- --What do I do with the lower court's finding that this father, despite not being married to his prior lover, had children, was attentive of those children, had the resources to raise the child? What do we with -- why are you-- --But they looked at something else that everybody's ignoring-- --Mr. Clement, can I go back to that best interest calculus. There's two timeframes in my mind to look at: In January, when he asserted his parental rights and 2 years later when the trial was heard. If there's serious emotional harm, I think the court below said: We're not looking at what happens at the time we're deciding the custody issue, because otherwise, we're going to give custody by estoppel. We're going to encourage people to hold on to kids and create the serious physical harm. In January, when he asserted his rights, that's what we're looking at. What was in the best interests of the child at the time the issue was raised, and that was 4 or 5 months after the birth of the child. So we're going to freeze it at that point or are we going to freeze it today, after the child's been with his -- with her father for 2 years? I don't want to be that judge, by the way. Tell me why you are fighting Justice Breyer? He said: I see -- and your -- Mr. Clement said the same thing -- that “ good cause ” under 1958 is a variant of best interests of the child or factors that are considered. I see (f) as doing the same thing, allotting however a burden of proof that may or may not be higher than other States. I mean, in -- in -- some States may have clear and convincing evidence, some States may have preponderance. Some States -- I don't know if any have beyond a reasonable doubt. But it's an allocation of burden. You might just have to take-- --Counsel, there are two forms of the EIFD doctrine, the existing Indian family doctrine. One applies directly to this case; what's the status of an unwed father, and they seem, under that doctrine, to apply the definition that a parent who hasn't been involved in the care during pregnancy is not a father. But the other side of the doctrine is the one that addresses, I think, the Chief's concern, which is you don't only have Indian blood, but you've been a father who's actually been a member of an Indian tribe, an active member. We don't have to reach that separate issue here, that EIFD -- that part of the EIFD doctrine. I don't disagree. Counsel, this Act, in terms of voluntary surrender of Indian children by parents, says that it's not final for an adoptive parent until the court does the adoption decree. It gives the mother the right -- or father -- to rescind the voluntary adoption till the very last minute. Has that stopped voluntary adoptions? ",be you suggest i do not know that the party i know that the government have say that f do not apply to the father but d do so there be not a full concession on your point but put that aside if it be a father who have visitation right and exercise all of his support obligation be it your position that that because that father s not a custodian he have no protection whatsoever under d or e the

2012,FTC v. Actavis Inc.,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Stewart, can we go back to Justice Breyer's question, initial question. It's rare that we find a per se antitrust violation. Most situations we put it into rule of reason. You seem to be arguing that this is price fixing, a reverse payment like price fixing so that it has to fall into something greater than the rule of reason. But why is the rule of reason so bad? As an -- and that's really my bottom line, because you're creating all -- I think that's what Justice Breyer was saying. I mean, for -- for example, I have difficulty understanding why the mere existence of a reverse payment is presumptively gives -- changes the burden from the Plaintiff. It would seem to me that you have to bear the burden -- the burden of proving that the payment for services or the value given was too high. I don't know why it has to shift to the other side. So answer the more fundamental question: Why is the rule of reason so bad? Why isn't this then? Meaning there is no presumption of infringement. There's no presumption that the item that someone else is going to sell necessarily infringes. So what you're arguing is that in fact a settlement of an infringement action is now creating that presumption. I don't know, but I don't know why we would be required to accept that there has or would be infringement by the product that has voluntarily decided not to pursue its rights. But there, you'd know that they're not sharing the profits. Meaning there you know that a -- a product's been licensed and the -- that's normal. The infringer is now paying the other side money to sell that product. A reverse payment suggests something different, that they're sharing profits. I don't know what else you can conclude. But not many for reverse payments. Is that in all cases or just Hatch-Waxman cases? Because it does skew the dynamics a lot. You know, the Second Circuit recognized, even though it accepted your scope of the patent, that there was a troubling dynamic in what you're arguing, which is that the less sound the patent, the more you're going to hurt consumers, because those are the cases where the payoff, the sharing of profits is the greatest inducement for the patentholder. For whom? And -- and -- you know, the government is basically saying, we really don't want reverse payments, period. We want people to settle this the way they should settle it, which is on the strength of the patent. And that means settling it simply by either paying a royalty for use or settling as most cases do, on an early entry alone, so there's no sharing of -- of -- of profits. What's so bad about that? I mean, it doesn't deprive either side of the ability to finish the litigation if they want to. Well, in the normal course, if the patent's really strong, if you get a year or two earlier entry, that has an inherent value, and that's what you'll pay for is what the government is saying. That will be the determination the two parties will make, which is at what point is earlier entry worth it-- --for the very strong patentholder. Well, they pointed to most settlements and say that is the vast majority. Well, we do know that these reverse payments, except for recent times when people figured out they were so valuable, were the exception, not the rule. They have been increasing in number, not decreasing. I see that as an argument that there is an economic reality in Hatch-Waxman that would require us not to apply any rule we choose or accept here to other situations; only here. That's the argument that you're creating for me, that there's a different economic reality here that requires a different rule. Oh, but it does, because in Hatch-Waxman Congress decided that there was a benefit for generics entering without suffering a potential loss to enter the market more quickly. And any settlement in these cases deprives consumers of the potential of having the benefit of an earlier entry. Exactly, and what you are doing with permitting settlements of this kind is not permitting the process to go to conclusion. It's encouraging infringement suits. ",mr stewart can we go back to justice breyer s question initial question it be rare that we find a per se antitrust violation most situation we put it into rule of reason you seem to be argue that this be price fixing a reverse payment like price fix so that it have to fall into something great than the rule of reason but why be the rule of reason so bad as an and that be really my bottom line because you be create all i think that be what justice breyer be say i mean for for example i have difficulty understand why the mere existence of a reverse payment be presumptively give change the burden from the plaintiff it would seem to me that you have to bear the burden the burden of prove that the payment for service or the value give be too high i do not know why it have to shift to the other side so answer the more fundamental question why be the rule of reason so bad why be not this then meaning there be no presumption of infringement there be no presumption that the item that someone else be go to sell necessarily infringes so what you be argue be that in fact a settlement of an infringement action be now create that presumption i do not know but i do not know why we would be require to accept that there have or would be infringement by the product that have voluntarily decide not to pursue its right but there you would know that they be not share the profit mean there you know that a a product s be license and the that be normal the infringer be now pay the other side money to sell that product a reverse payment suggest something different that they be share profit i do not know what else you can conclude but not many for reverse payment be that in all case or just hatch waxman case because it do skew the dynamic a lot you know the second circuit recognize even though it accept your scope of the patent that there be a troubling dynamic in what you be argue which be that the less sound the patent the more you be go to hurt consumer because those be the case where the payoff the sharing of profit be the great inducement for the patentholder for whom and and you know the government be basically say we really do not want reverse payment period we want people to settle this the way they should settle it which be on the strength of the patent and that mean settle it simply by either pay a royalty for use or settling as most case do on an early entry alone so there be no sharing of of of profit what be so bad about that i mean it do not deprive either side of the ability to finish the litigation if they want to well in the normal course if the patent s really strong if you get a year or two early entry that have an inherent value and that be what you will pay for be what the government be say that will be the determination the two party will make which be at what point be earlier entry worth it for the very strong patentholder well they point to most settlement and say that be the vast majority well we do know that these reverse payment except for recent time when people figure out they we be so valuable we be the exception not the rule they have be increase in number not decrease i see that as an argument that there be an economic reality in hatch waxman that would require us not to apply any rule we choose or accept here to other situation only here that be the argument that you be create for me that there be a different economic reality here that require a different rule oh but it do because in hatch waxman congress decide that there be a benefit for generic enter without suffer a potential loss to enter the market more quickly and any settlement in these case deprive consumer of the potential of have the benefit of an early entry exactly and what you be do with permit settlement of this kind be not permit the process to go to conclusion it be encourage infringement suit ,298.13,Roberts Court,"Mar 25, 2013",Federal Trade Commission,Actavis Inc. et al.,12-416,"Dec 7, 2012","Jun 17, 2013",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2012,FTC v. Phoebe Putney Health System,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"You don't think that the grant of powers in this case would permit the hospital authorities, the corporation, to set prices for their services that are below the competitive prices in order to serve the needy? Isn't that inherent in the regulations? Tying. A network is tying products, to tie products. I guess that just adds on to the issues that we have a price-fixing mechanism, we have a tying mechanism that is expressed. So what's left after that? Just this? Mergers and acquisitions? At what point-- --Could you define “ necessity ” as you use it? I am hearkening back to Justice Kagan. We have plenty of cases that say you don't need to find out whether the exemption is necessary to make the program work. We don't make that judgment. The state makes that judgment. Exactly. And in your answer, you conceded that whether -- if there is discretion, it's not necessary to make it work because the authority can say yes or no-- --So what's your definition of “ necessity ”? Would you-- --There is a problem here, which is, I understand the public mandate to serve the indigent, but you are asking us to take this a step further. You're elevating that public mandate to a public command that serving the indigent has to override the needs of the majority in terms of price competition. And that, that step, that further step that the State intended to immunize their -- the monopoly power, is the step we are trying to find in this grant. And that's what I don't see. I see the compulsion to serve the needy. I hear that much of Georgia is rural, but your adversary says in most instances there is only one hospital, so the municipality's taking it over is not going to be a merger issue. To the extent that they step in and take over one of two hospitals, there is no merger issue because it's only substituting one owner for another. This situation they claim is a rarity, where there are only two or three providers and a hospital's going to -- and a public -- a municipality is going to then get monopoly power by an acquisition. Mr. Waxman, I'm showing my ignorance. Is this -- would this merger be subject to the rule of reason? If it were -- if we were not to find state immunity, would the merger be subject to the rule of reason? I was embarrassed to ask the question, but I was taught to ask the question. If it is -- I'm going to assume that we'll both be -- we'll both be corrected by our respective colleagues soon enough. But if it-- --That's right. But -- but my question is really more fundamental, which is yes, I understand that you have a great defense, potentially, to a rule of reason challenge that -- that there was necessity in its truest sense, in its economic sense in this situation, so why should we undo our decades of writings that say that we should construe immunity narrowly and not broadly when it comes to displacing our antitrust laws? Counsel, can I interrupt-- --you just a moment to address a question raised by Justice Breyer, which is your alternative argument. You have lots of evidence that the authority does very little oversight of these hospitals when they move forward. But is that the issue before us? Is the question of immunity as to what happens in the operation of the hospital, or in their merger and acquisition, their actual formation?

2012,Moncrieffe v. Holder,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Excuse me. You use that word, regularly. Do you have statistics on that? Were they provided in the briefs? You -- we are discussing the categorical approach, but let's assume he had pled guilty, and in his allocution, he had admitted to not a smaller amount or to remuneration. Would -- would an immigration judge, under the argument you're making today, have to ignore that allocution, or would he be able to apply the modified approach and find this gentleman an aggravated felon? That's the issue with this case. None of these immigrants are being let out automatically. They are still felons subject to removal. The only issue is whether-- --Well -- they're-- --they're still subject to removal-- --either way. Mr. Goldstein, there are at least 93 cases, all right. So-- --And I don't know and I'm not going to ask you to prove to me how the burden of proof was met or not met in those. But let me give you a different hypothetical. Let's assume Georgia has the Federal statute, but, differently than the Federal statute, it has a sale-distribution provision, and it has a small amount, no remuneration statute. What would happen in those states? What's the free pass? The free pass is mandatory as opposed to discretionary deportation, correct? So the free pass is that-- --But those convicted individuals would still be subject to deportation. And nothing would stop the INS judge from considering the amount of drugs, correct, that the individual actually was involved in, and that could be introduced through hearsay, through almost any document, correct? Yes. Well, do you suggest that the immigration judges don't know that, and that they wouldn't weigh that desire heavily in a case in which a -- the convicted individual is proven to have sold the larger amount? You still think they are going to cancel? Each time you get -- you say that, you get back into the hole that Justice Kagan has been asking you to climb out of. If -- if Congress's intent was to bar discretion, then I'm not quite sure how you get to your alternative to get out of your-- --overinclusiveness argument. I'm sorry, counselor. I -- the Government can do it very easily. If you have less than an ounce of marijuana and nothing else from which you can infer an intent to sell or distribute, and you have no proof that this individual's engaged in drug trafficking, what more does a defendant have to show? How does it raise his burden of proof? And I guess my point is that one, which is don't the facts that the Government have either show it or not show it in virtually every instance? It would be less than an ounce. Can I go back to your substantive argument? All right. This is a -- you are right; it's an unusually crafted statute, and really what the issue is, generally what you have with lesser included offenses is you have a base offense and then an enhancement that goes up. You commit the base offense-- --of burglary, but if you did it with an explosive or you did it with a dangerous weapon, it goes up. And applying the categorical approach is relatively easy there because either the State offense includes the addition or it doesn't. This is sort of in reverse. You've got a statute with the same elements that can be either a misdemeanor or a felony, and you're saying it can be either under the CSA, but we have to assume it's the greater. Because-- --of Apprendi, because of -- of-- --But that's under Apprendi. That's a-- --Didn't we -- didn't we talk about the categorical approach in footnote 3 of our case in Carachuri? Where we said that in talking about the generic Federal offense, whether it's a felony or not, that we can't look at just strictly the elements of the crime, but we have to also look at the sentencing factors, because when we're talking about what constitutes a misdemeanor or a felony under Federal law we have to look at both. But the same elements would go to the misdemeanor. Really the issue for me is it could be one or both and when do we tell the immigration judge that he can, should, or should not-- --choose between the two? However you do it, the misdemeanor still has the same three elements. So how do we choose between it being a misdemeanor or a felony? Counsel, under the -- under the -- do you have the same answer as Mr. Goldstein, that the modified categorical approach wouldn't permit the immigration judge to look at the plea allocution to determine the amount? So that in -- in many of these cases that we're talking about, it is possible that the plea allocution itself would set out the amounts that the alien sold or show that he sold something-- --and that would take care of this issue of how many people are escaping automatic removal. But the vast majority -- the vast majority in my experience do -- do say whether the crime was for sale or distribution.

2012,Agency for International Development v. Alliance for Open Society International,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"But that's-- --I'm sorry. Finish answering him and then I'll-- --The problem that I have with that answer is that it doesn't cure the organization's need to stay true to its own beliefs. Because if -- and I think this is what Justice Breyer is trying to get to -- if it truly an independent organization speaking, then that's that organization's belief; it's not an alternative under Rust to the needs of that organization to have its own personal views. And -- and so I have that problem, which is how is it an alternative for that organization to be able to have its views? Let me posit a hypothetical that I'm actually very troubled by. Let's assume a city government is undertaking a campaign to prevent teen pregnancy and its associated problems, and it wants to promote the use of contraceptives that protect from contracting, you know, diseases, things like that. And some of its programs involve the distribution of contraceptives, but others involve parenting classes for teenage mothers and offering them free daycare. And a church seeks funds for the daycare part and the parenting part. Can the city now say because we have this really important need to avoid sexually transmitted diseases, anyone who seeks our funds also have to say they believe in the use of contraceptives? The church there would say, we don't believe and why should we say we believe. Excuse me. That's my problem, which is I'm trying to tease out what your position is. Okay? I -- I have an understanding of you're saying: You can't compel me to say I don't like something. And -- and that's like a oath of loyalty. That -- that's understandable. But if the government said the following more clearly -- this is an oddly phrased policy, okay, because it seems to be requiring this oath. But if it simply said, ""If you're an organization that wants our funds, you have to say that you're not going to promote actively the contrary policy. "" would that be okay? ""You're not going to go out there and do things to promote the legalization of prostitution because that's going to undermined our message. "" Those are two different positions, so tell me where you draw the line. Yes, that's Rust. This is a step further. So-- --No, no, no. I cut you off. But -- but I guess what I'm -- I keep going back -- you keep going back and forth on this it -- it's not okay to tell me to take an oath of loyalty. But would it be okay for you to step outside the doors of this program and pass out literature that promotes the legalization of prostitution? Am I making my question clear? Which is how do you -- how do you answer the question of why does the Constitution bar the government from saying, look, if you're going to work with me, you can't go out there and promote a -- actively promote-- --a different message? Well-- I would have less problem accepting your message if there weren't four major organizations who were exempted from the policy requirement and -- medical science -- vaccinators are exempted.

2012,Hollingsworth v. Perry,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"But can you tell me -- that's a factual background with respect to their right to put the ballot initiative on the ballot, but how does it create an injury to them separate from that of every other taxpayer to have laws enforced? At least one of the amici have suggested that it seems counterintuitive to think that the State is going to delegate to people who don't have a fiduciary duty to them, that it's going to delegate the responsibility of representing the State to individuals who have their own views. They proposed the ballot initiative because it was their individual views, not necessarily that of the State. So-- --Justice Scalia proffered the question of the Attorney General. The Attorney General has no personal interest. He has a fiduciary obligation. Why isn't the fiduciary duty requirement before the State can designate a representative important? Well, generally you don't need to specify it because generally the people who get to enforce the legislation of the government are people who are in government positions elected by the people. Here these individuals are not elected by the people or appointed by the people. Outside of the -- outside of the marriage context, can you think of any other rational basis, reason, for a State using sexual orientation as a factor in denying homosexuals benefits or imposing burdens on them? Is there any other rational decision-making that the Government could make? Denying them a job, not granting them benefits of some sort, any other decision? All right. If that -- if that is true, then why aren't they a class? If they're a class that makes any other discrimination improper, irrational, then why aren't we treating them as a class for this one thing? Are you saying that the interest of marriage is so much more compelling than any other interest as they could have? So you -- so what -- I don't quite understand it. If you're not dealing with this as a class question, then why would you say that the Government is not free to discriminate against them? I'm sorry, where is this-- --I'm sorry. Mr. Olson, I think the bottom line-- --Mr. Olson, I think that you're not answering the fundamental fear. And so -- and -- and the amici brief that sets forth this test of fiduciary duty doesn't quite either. The assumption is that there are not executive officials who want to defend the law. They don't like it. No one's going to do that. So how do you get the law defended in that situation? So why -- why isn't this viewed as an appointment process, that the in -- the ballot initiators have now become that body? Is that your argument-- --Mr. Olson, the bottom line that you're being asked -- and -- and it is one that I'm interested in the answer: If you say that marriage is a fundamental right, what State restrictions could ever exist? Meaning, what State restrictions with respect to the number of people, with respect to -- that could get married -- the incest laws, the mother and child, assuming that they are the age -- I can -- I can accept that the State has probably an overbearing interest on -- on protecting a child until they're of age to marry, but what's left? Is there any way to decide this case in a principled manner that is limited to California only? General, there is an irony in that, which is the States that do more have less rights. How would the record be different elsewhere? But they are not the only ones. I think that begs your -- Mr. Olson doesn't really focus on this. If the issue is letting the States experiment and letting the society have more time to figure out its direction, why is taking a case now the answer? We let issues perk, and so we let racial segregation perk for 50 years from 1898 to 1954. And now we are only talking about, at most, four years.

Is a Federal court supposed to continue with that presumption in light of an undisputed state's statement that their rules are consonant with the Confrontation Clause. Well, let's assume it's not after our -- we render our decision. If one-- --Irrebuttably? I see exceptions to that already. There are cases where the state court reaches one prong of the Strickland standard, has no need to go to the second. So you really can't say in that situation that you can assume they reached the second, can you? All of the circuit courts basically have a rule close to the one announced by Justice Alito, don't they? All of them have essentially a presumption that's rebutted by some form of evidence, except for perhaps the Eleventh and this circuit that have a clear, almost irrebuttable presumption. I'm sorry. Not the Ninth, but the Eleventh. But it's not as absolute as the Eleventh. I have a -- you know, I mean, for every rule you're going to find an exception that abuses it. It's the nature of human nature. Do you know what the total number of habeas petitions there are and what the percentage that are actually granted? Would you be willing to accept that it's -- in relationship to the total granted, it's very, very small? So whatever the abuse of the system is, it hasn't halted justice. That the person is not guilty is a bias? That -- that's -- that may be your strongest point, but most of what he said was basically this is a murder case, and the evidence has to be beyond a reasonable doubt, and I think it has to be clear enough for me to be convinced. Is that a biased juror? I must say that, like Justice Kennedy, I'm deeply troubled when trial judges intrude in the deliberative processes of juries. Most of the time when we're assessing bias, we're assessing it on the grounds of extraneous evidence, a juror who has said one thing in voir dire and is now either a convicted felon or introduced extraneous circumstance. But the degree of being convinced is the very essence of jury deliberations. This case is troublesome. I'm not sure how you can say that. I mean, I think the simplest statement of the State rule is that the State believes that if you remove a juror for actual bias, that that is okay under the Sixth Amendment. They said it in Cleveland. They were presented with the argument in this case by the briefing that the juror was not biased and hence the Sixth Amendment was violated. And they ruled to say he was biased, and I see as a natural, clear inference that they were saying the Sixth Amendment wasn't violated because he was biased. That's a different question. That question is whether the California Supreme Court's Cleveland decision, its assumption that a biased juror violates -- doesn't violate -- the removal of a biased juror doesn't violate the Sixth Amendment, is that an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent, not circuit court precedent? What Supreme Court precedent commands that result? Is this -- is this a holding that the Sixth Amendment requires you to keep a biased juror as long as the juror says, I have doubts about the sufficiency of the evidence? Now, answer my question. Does the Sixth Amendment require you to keep a biased juror? All right. So, if the Sixth Amendment doesn't require you to keep a biased juror, then why is it that the state court's finding that this juror was biased a Sixth Amendment holding, that it wasn't violated because the juror was biased? The logic is almost inescapable to me. Did the California court find the juror was biased? ",what happen when there be a challenge to the admission of evidence on a state law ground on a confrontation clause ground and all the state court do be grapple with the evidentiary rule but it be self evident that the confrontation clause be base on a different theory be we to assume in the light of that kind of decision that the court actually grapple with the confrontation clause be i to make that assumption when before our line of case in this area state court generally have hold that if hearsay be admissible under their evidentiary rule that that be the end of their confrontation clause challenge be a federal court suppose to continue with that presumption in light of an undisputed state s statement that their rule be consonant with the confrontation clause well let us assume it be not after our we render our decision if one irrebuttably i see exception to that already there be case where the state court reach one prong of the strickland standard have no need to go to the second so you really can not say in that situation that you can assume they reach the second can you all of the circuit court basically have a rule close to the one announce by justice alito do not they all of them have essentially a presumption that be rebut by some form of evidence except for perhaps the eleventh and this circuit that have a clear almost irrebuttable presumption I be sorry not the ninth but the eleventh but it be not as absolute as the eleventh i have a you know i mean for every rule you be go to find an exception that abuse it it be the nature of human nature do you know what the total number of habeas petition there be and what the percentage that be actually grant would you be willing to accept that it be in relationship to the total grant it be very very small so whatever the abuse of the system be it have not halt justice that the person be not guilty be a bias that that be that may be your strong point but most of what he say be basically this be a murder case and the evidence have to be beyond a reasonable doubt and i think it have to be clear enough for me to be convince be that a biased juror i must say that like justice kennedy I be deeply troubled when trial judge intrude in the deliberative process of jury most of the time when we be assess bias we be assess it on the ground of extraneous evidence a juror who have say one thing in voir dire and be now either a convict felon or introduce extraneous circumstance but the degree of be convince be the very essence of jury deliberation this case be troublesome I be not sure how you can say that i mean i think the simple statement of the state rule be that the state believe that if you remove a juror for actual bias that that be okay under the sixth amendment they say it in cleveland they we be present with the argument in this case by the briefing that the juror be not bias and hence the sixth amendment be violate and they rule to say he be bias and i see as a natural clear inference that they we be say the sixth amendment be not violate because he be bias that be a different question that question be whether the california supreme court s cleveland decision its assumption that a biased juror violate do not violate the removal of a biased juror do not violate the sixth amendment be that an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent not circuit court precedent what supreme court precedent command that result be this be this a hold that the sixth amendment require you to keep a biased juror as long as the juror say i have doubt about the sufficiency of the evidence now answer my question do the sixth amendment require you to keep a biased juror all right so if the sixth amendment do not require you to keep a biased juror then why be it that the state court s finding that this juror be bias a sixth amendment holding that it be not violate because the juror be bias the logic be almost inescapable to me do the california court find the juror be bias ,306.4400000000001,Roberts Court,"Oct 3, 2012","Deborah K.

2012,Alleyne v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, could you address an issue that's very important to me, the one of stare decisis. And so, that -- hone in on that. Well, the problem is, whether you're right or wrong -- and you're absolutely right, it was a plurality opinion -- your adversary says States have passed laws relying on it, the Federal system is now structured around it, why isn't the damage as great as they claim? Potential damage, I should say. Address, please, the practical consequences. How many -- how many Federal courts are you aware are already charging the 924(c) facts to a jury, notwithstanding the -- the fact that it's not required? Can I say-- --Do you have any statistics on at least 924(c) of how often the greater is the sentence than the absolute minimum required by law? So, in effect, your argument is that fixing a sentence is different than giving a judge discretion because it ignores the fact that a judge might have given you less? So it's depriving you of the constitutional right to have a jury decide what your sentence could be? Of having a judge decide what your sentence could be? How about Booker? What did Booker do-- --to the logic of Apprendi? Even when the statutes had a higher maximum. Because the jury was -- because the judge was constrained within a different maximum. Is that your argument here? Could I go back to a simple question on the stare decisis, the practicality question. What is so impractical about letting a jury decide an issue that sets a mandatory sentence of any kind? Why -- why are juries incapable of figuring out whether a gun was carried or brandished? Why are they incapable of figuring out how many -- how much drugs were sold or whether someone was driven by any of the factors that States want to commit to judges, but the Sixth Amendment might require them to submit to juries? But what does that have to do with the needs, the constitutional need to make sure that juries are driving a fixed sentence of any kind? You know, but that-- --I'm sorry. Mr. Dreeben, can I go back to a point you made earlier? You talked about a legislature not attempting to supplant the jury's role on the maximum. You don't see the same danger -- we started out in a country where almost all sentencing was in the discretion of the judge; whatever crime you committed, the judge could decide where to sentence you. As Apprendi and its subsequent progeny laid out, these sentencing changes that have come into existence have really come into existence the latter half of the last century. What -- don't you fear that at some point the legislature will go back to the old system of supplanting the jury by just saying what it said in 924(c)? Every single crime has a maximum of life. And all the -- and every single fact that's going to set a real sentence for the defendant, a minimum, we're going to let the judge decide by a preponderance of the evidence. The bottom line of my question is, when Apprendi was decided, what should be the driving force of protecting the jury system? The deprivation of discretion, whether that's permissible or not, or whether a sentence is fixed in a range, whatever it might be, by a jury? What's the better rule to keep both extremes from happening? I'm sorry, the historical -- you said earlier that most of the historical evidence was that determinate sentences would be decided by juries; they found facts and a determinate sentence was given. So what is the judicial discretion now? You find by a preponderance of the evidence, and a mandatory minimum makes you give seven. So where is the judicial discretion? You think for a defendant in a constitutional right, that they are more -- that it's constitutional to have a determinate sentence at seven, and still constitutional and make the jury find it by a -- beyond a reasonable doubt and that it's still constitutional to have a determinative sentence of 7 years but have the jury find it by a preponderance of the evidence? Those are -- those are equal? No, I know we said it in Harris; the question here before us today is-- --So how about in O'Brien, if the legislature had said 40 years for a machine gun. Would we -- how do we justify saying, No, that has to remain an element? Under your theory, the democratic process didn't work. So how -- what would we do in that situation? Why is the legislature being deprived of that right, if they give it to the jury? I mean, it seems to me that whether you give it to a jury or a judge, the legislature protects itself by declaring a minimum sentence. It determines the sentence, really. ",counsel could you address an issue that be very important to me the one of stare decisis and so that hone in on that well the problem be whether you be right or wrong and you be absolutely right it be a plurality opinion your adversary say state have pass law rely on it the federal system be now structure around it why be not the damage as great as they claim potential damage i should say address please the practical consequence how many how many federal court be you aware be already charge the c facts to a jury notwithstanding the the fact that it be not require can i say do you have any statistic on at least c of how often the great be the sentence than the absolute minimum require by law so in effect your argument be that fix a sentence be different than give a judge discretion because it ignore the fact that a judge might have give you less so it be deprive you of the constitutional right to have a jury decide what your sentence could be of have a judge decide what your sentence could be how about booker what do booker do to the logic of apprendi even when the statute have a high maximum because the jury be because the judge be constrain within a different maximum be that your argument here could i go back to a simple question on the stare decisis the practicality question what be so impractical about let a jury decide an issue that set a mandatory sentence of any kind why why be jury incapable of figure out whether a gun be carry or brandish why be they incapable of figure out how many how much drug we be sell or whether someone be drive by any of the factor that state want to commit to judge but the sixth amendment might require them to submit to jury but what do that have to do with the need the constitutional need to make sure that jury be drive a fixed sentence of any kind you know but that I be sorry mr dreeben can i go back to a point you make earlier you talk about a legislature not attempt to supplant the jury s role on the maximum you do not see the same danger we start out in a country where almost all sentencing be in the discretion of the judge whatever crime you commit the judge could decide where to sentence you as apprendi and its subsequent progeny lay out these sentence change that have come into existence have really come into existence the latter half of the last century what do not you fear that at some point the legislature will go back to the old system of supplant the jury by just say what it say in c every single crime have a maximum of life and all the and every single fact that be go to set a real sentence for the defendant a minimum we be go to let the judge decide by a preponderance of the evidence the bottom line of my question be when apprendi be decide what should be the drive force of protect the jury system the deprivation of discretion whether that be permissible or not or whether a sentence be fix in a range whatever it might be by a jury what be the good rule to keep both extreme from happen I be sorry the historical you say early that most of the historical evidence be that determinate sentence would be decide by jury they find fact and a determinate sentence be give so what be the judicial discretion now you find by a preponderance of the evidence and a mandatory minimum make you give seven so where be the judicial discretion you think for a defendant in a constitutional right that they be more that it be constitutional to have a determinate sentence at seven and still constitutional and make the jury find it by a beyond a reasonable doubt and that it be still constitutional to have a determinative sentence of year but have the jury find it by a preponderance of the evidence those be those be equal no i know we say it in harris the question here before us today be so how about in obrien if the legislature have say year for a machine gun would we how do we justify say no that have to remain an element under your theory the democratic process do not work so how what would we do in that situation why be the legislature be deprive of that right if they give it to the jury i mean it seem to me that whether you give it to a jury or a judge the legislature protect itself by declare a minimum sentence it determine the sentence really ,330.41000000000014,Roberts Court,"Jan 14, 2013",Allen Ryan Alleyne,United States,11-9335,"Oct 5, 2012","Jun 17, 2013",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2012,Mutual Pharmaceutical Co. v. Bartlett,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"So tell me, is -- is it now your position, and it seems to be, that any time the FDA approves a product that there can never be a tort liability claim because the FDA's approval is now the ceiling of what you can do? They approve nonprescription drugs. They approve a lot of things. But that's not true with respect to the active ingredients. An active ingredient requires a new FDA approval process. But -- but we came back to the same point, which is -- and we are sort of dancing around the argument -- which is what happens with a truly dangerous drug, and we can posit one, that has nothing to do with a warning of whether it's adequate or not, but a drug that on its face no reasonable practitioner -- I'm going to the restatement third formulation -- no reasonable practitioner, knowing all the benefits and risks, would ever prescribe this drug. Because your adversary basically took that position at trial. It doesn't matter -- there were other, safer, one-molecule drugs; no one should have prescribed this, no matter what the label. We can argue. But let's go to the point I raised, which is, I think what you are arguing now is that no truly bad drug, that shouldn't be on the market, would there ever be a tort claim that anybody could bring-- --because the FDA approved it. So what tort claim could they bring? Both, again, the brand could manufacture and the generic. How? The FDA approved the design. And they couldn't change it without FDA approval. Isn't there a First Circuit-- So without the preemption clause, actually, with an express saving clause, you're arguing essentially complete field preemption. You're basically saying the minute that the FDA gives you permission to sell, it's a right to sell. And -- and it can't be altered by any State police power. Well, I don't see how you're not saying that. But that's your -- you're telling me that's exactly what the FDA is saying. You're saying there is no such thing. And there's no strict liability that a State could impose. This applies to everything that requires FDA approval, or is this a prescription drug-only rule? Just -- just to -- because my memory is failing me, is this drug still on the market? All right. And is it on the market with a different label? Is your point in this case that obstacle preemption has been waived? Or were you granted cert just on impossibility?

2012,Kloeckner v Solis,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counselor, can I back you up a minute to join the two questions that my colleague posed to you? Let's assume there's a merits-based decision on the CSRA and one on the discrimination. In the normal course, assuming you are not barred by being untimely, you could go to the district court, and the district court presumably would have jurisdiction, if one is a discrimination-based decision, to decide both questions. What's the standard of review that a court would apply to each of those claims independently or together? I mean-- --that that's-- --We can then fight about whether the factual issue regarding the timeliness and exhaustion should be subject to one or the other standard of review, but what are the standards of review? All right. You argued that you were exceeding the dismissals on the basis of jurisdiction should go to the Federal circuit, but that you were only invoking the exception that procedural dismissals should be permitted to go to the district court or authorized to go. Are you still standing by that distinction? Yes, but when you argued it below you argued the exception, you didn't argue the jurisdictional rule. Are you abandoning that distinction? But it's not the view of the circuit courts, even the courts-- --Even the courts whose exception you-- --Every circuit court unanimously holds that jurisdictional rule dismissals should go only to the Federal circuit. And you-- --Should you be arguing this before us? Is this a distinction you should abandon here? Or at least ask us not to address? Actually the 7512 argument has more legs, I think. The point is that you're only permitted to go to district court on issues of discrimination that are within the Board's jurisdiction. So if-- Are you abandoning the jurisdictional procedural distinction as you did in your brief? Are you telling us to rule either completely for you or against you? So you are prepared on behalf of the Government to say that if we rule that procedural dismissals can go to the district court, then you -- then the Government will concede that jurisdictional dismissal should as well? Under 7512. We don't have to reach that question in this case, but your brief seemed to make the argument that there was no basis for the distinction between procedural and jurisdictional. Can I ask you a couple questions? When the Federal Circuit was created, this language preexisted its creation, correct? So could you tell me how when Congress was writing 7702 it was creating the system that you are advocating when it had no idea that it would ever create the Federal Circuit? That still doesn't answer my question, which is: Assuming there is no Federal Circuit, I have to read the language that exists in 7702 and 7703, and I see judicial review, appealable judicial review, used not in the manner that you're describing. You don't have a quarrel with your opposing counsel's position that once the Board decides the CSRA claim and the discrimination claim, the district court reviews both? Justice Alito was questioning that, but you don't quarrel with that. So the lack of uniformity is inherent in this structure. You just want to carve out one piece of it that-- --that you say deserves more uniformity. I have a problem, because to accept your reading is to say that judicially reviewable action differs between 770 -- differs between 7702 and the escape hatch, because the only way the escape hatch can work, it, too, cross-references 7702 in the same way that the provisions you are relying on do. Under your reading both should be given identical meaning, because they both cross-reference 7702; and yet your brief says, no, we shouldn't have that absurd result. It seems to me that if you concede that there is an absurd result in applying your interpretation to the escape hatch, by definition, your meaning can't be ascribable to that phrase. So if the board-- --So when does the time frames of the escape hatch commence-- --if the board hasn't rendered any decision on anything? You still have an exhaustion argument to raise if we were to send this to the district court?

2012,Already LLC v. Nike,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Well, does that mean that if they gave you a covenant that said, vis-a-vis your company, our trademark, the form of this shoe, is invalid, we won't sue you for anything, either an exact duplicate or any colorable imitation thereof with respect to this design; would that be enough for you? I know you want to help everybody else-- --but why wouldn't that be-- --So-- --what you're saying is you-- --But I don't know why -- but my solution was that they would give you a covenant that I suggested as a possibility that would say, vis-a-vis you, you can imitate, counterfeit, use this design, only vis-a-vis you. Why doesn't that protect you fully? Because what they're saying to you is, copy the design if you want, so long as you're not using another trademark. But that's not the issue. The issue is whether you're infringing this design. Ms. Anders, what -- there is a question about why a competitor should have to produce to its competition its future plans of development. I mean, the marketplace, especially in fashion, importantly, likes to keep quiet what it's doing because it doesn't want other imitators to beat it to the punch. So given that interest, why isn't their claim that they're being inhibited because of the requirement to produce their products or their intended products enough to establish injury in this case? Well, then what did-- --I read this affidavit as saying, we're in the shoe industry, we're going to make new shoes regularly. We want to copy their shoe. We don't think it's protected by trademark. We want to copy it -- they don't say, and that's something on rebuttal that maybe Petitioner will explain, that we want to copy it exactly. But what they're saying is, we want to copy it because it's a free form. That's really what I read their affidavit as saying. So if -- why do they have to actually -- do they have to produce their design to prove they're doing that? But saying it is enough? That's what I thought their affidavit said, and I thought the court below said, no, you've got to show us the product. Please, now go back to my question. Is it enough to just say it, or do they have to produce the designs so that the court and Nike can decide -- it is Nike, right? the court and Nike can decide whether the shoe is a colorable imitation or an exact copy. I agree with you. How do you deal with the point that's been discussed with your adversary, they have to show you everything they intend to produce? What entitles you to that showing? What if they simply said-- --you have the trademark, we think it's invalid, we want to copy your shoe? We want to copy just the form of your shoe because that's what the trademark involves. And once we have the invalidity, that's what we're going to do. Would that be enough of a showing? We don't have plans right now because your trademark stopped us from having the plans, but the minute your trademark is -- isn't validated, for sure we're going to do it because it's going to mean great sales if we put our name on it rather than your name. The colorful imitations -- colorable imitations are colorable imitations of their shoe? You haven't promised to not sue them over colorable imitations of your shoe? I'm making this as simple as I can. I'm a shoe manufacturer. I want to make new designs, and I want to be free to make the designs that I want. If this mark isn't validated-- --I intend to copy as much of it as I can. I don't have any records of doing the planning because the trademark was there. But for sure, given my current shoe-- --and the fact that they thought I imitated them-- --meaning you-- --you invalidate the mark, I'm going to copy as much of it as I can. Would that be enough? In your mind you're saying-- --You could do discovery then? And the discovery is going to show what? The president comes in and says exactly what I said. There are no plans-- --Yes. You don't have to read to us. I thought what they were arguing-- --You are saying that you've met -- if we decide you bear the burden of proof, you're saying, you -- you could live with that. And your burden was met by their submissions. His challenge, you said to have a chance in three different courts to say directly and unequivocally if the mark is invalid, we're going to imitate, and you haven't been willing to do that.

2012,Oxford Health Plans v. Sutter,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Waxman-- --That's my question. Did you never -- you never argued that it was beyond the power of the arbitrator to decide this question, did you? And do you take the position that this is a -- always an arbitrator's question when all disputes are supposed to be submitted, or was just -- was there just a mistake here? So why should we rewrite our standard of review to accommodate your client's error? Because that's really what you're asking us to do. More than once we have said an error of law or fact is not a basis to say that an arbitrator exceeded his or her powers. Mr. Waxman, how wrong does an arbitrator's decision have to be to become an issue of law? Meaning -- because that's the rule you're proposing. I used to think that exceeding your powers was deciding an issue the parties hadn't agreed to arbitrate, but here you've conceded that you gave the issue to the arbitrator. So he hasn't exceeded his power to construe the contract with respect to this dispute; do you agree with that? All right. So what instead you're saying is that “ exceeded your powers ” means that an error the arbitrator makes has to be of what quality? Can I-- --Can I see-- --Counsel -- counsel, you seem -- I don't know. I see two questions here. The first was an arbitrator exceeds his power if he decides a question is arbitral when it's not. And -- but here there is no dispute about that because you are right, your adversary submitted this question to arbitration. And that's what I'm hearing you respond. He did, there's no question, he said the arbitrator has to decide this issue. Justice Breyer raised the second question: Assuming he could, is there any remaining power in the Court to overturn his decision? And Justice Breyer said, If the standard is manifest disregard of fact and law, why would you still win? Because your adversary is saying: The law is clear you have to find some hook in the agreement to agree to class action -- arbitration. And he says there is none. That's basically his position, that the arbitrator's decision on its substance manifestly disregarded the law. So that's the question that I believe is extant still. Was it a hypothetical? [Laughter] No, I want to say why there wasn't. I want you to explain why there wasn't one. ",mr waxman that be my question do you never you never argue that it be beyond the power of the arbitrator to decide this question do you and do you take the position that this be a always an arbitrator s question when all dispute be suppose to be submit or be just be there just a mistake here so why should we rewrite our standard of review to accommodate your client s error because that be really what you be ask us to do more than once we have say an error of law or fact be not a basis to say that an arbitrator exceed his or her power mr waxman how wrong do an arbitrator s decision have to be to become an issue of law meaning because that be the rule you be propose i use to think that exceed your power be decide an issue the party have not agree to arbitrate but here you have concede that you give the issue to the arbitrator so he have not exceed his power to construe the contract with respect to this dispute do you agree with that all right so what instead you be say be that exceed your power mean that an error the arbitrator make have to be of what quality can i can i see counsel counsel you seem i do not know i see two question here the first be an arbitrator exceed his power if he decide a question be arbitral when it be not and but here there be no dispute about that because you be right your adversary submit this question to arbitration and that be what I be hear you respond he do there have no question he say the arbitrator have to decide this issue justice breyer raise the second question assuming he could be there any remain power in the court to overturn his decision and justice breyer say if the standard be manifest disregard of fact and law why would you still win because your adversary be say the law be clear you have to find some hook in the agreement to agree to class action arbitration and he say there be none that be basically his position that the arbitrator s decision on its substance manifestly disregard the law so that be the question that i believe be extant still be it a hypothetical laughter no i want to say why there be not i want you to explain why there be not one ,169.91,Roberts Court,"Mar 25, 2013",Oxford Health Plans,John Ivan Sutter,12-135,"Dec 7, 2012","Jun 10, 2013",113.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2012,Florida v. Harris,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Garre-- --I thought all of these training facilities were private entities that contracted with police departments. Could I go back to Justice Ginsburg's question? There's no -- what I hear -- read the Florida court saying is there's no national standard for certification. That's correct? There's no national standard that defines what's adequate training, correct. So -- let me just finish my question. So assuming there's no national standards, then how do you expect a judge, without asking questions about the content of the certification process, the content of the training process, and what the results were and how they were measured, how do you expect a judge to decide whether the certification and the training are sufficiently adequate. But you still have to ask what that training was, and the judge still has to determine whether the judge believes it was adequate, correct? That's what the totality of circumstances requires. So what does a judge do, just say, the police department says this is adequate, so I have to accept it's adequate. Mr. Garre, I -- I have no problem that this record -- with this record. My problem is how do we rule. Because it seems the me that I'm not quite understanding what -- how -- the legal rule you're asking us to announce. I think the legal rule, you're saying, if the dog has been tested for proficiency by a police department's determination of what's adequate for proficiency, that establishes probable cause. That's what I think the rule you want us to -- to do. I don't know what the role of the judge is in that-- --with that rule. No certification, no questioning of the handler and the handler's training? The judge can't do any of that and shouldn't do any of that, is what you're saying. So it's not enough for you to win by us saying that a court can't insist on performance in the field records, that it has to look at the totality of the circumstances. What other case have -- have we announced, under a totality of the circumstance test, a absolute flat rule like the one you're proposing? Where else have we said that one thing alone establishes probable cause-- --that one factor alone. Counsel, I'm somewhat troubled by all of the studies that have been presented to the Court, particularly the Australian one where, under a controlled setting, one dog alerted correctly only 12 percent of the time. How and when and who determines when a dog's reliability in alerting has reached a critical failure number? And what is -- what do you suggest that number is, and how does a judge determine that that's being monitored? Well, I'm deeply troubled by a dog that alerts only 12 percent of the time. That whatever -- whether we have a fixed number or an unfixed number, that seems like less than probability for me. That doesn't answer what happens to the dogs who have -- dogs grow old. They are taken out of service for a reason. So how -- how is a court supposed to monitor whether or not a dog has fallen out of-- Counsel, I have two separate questions for you. Tying the earlier case a little bit to this one, I am assuming that your position is -- and you'll tell me what the legal standard is -- that a well-trained dog, if he alerts, or walks by a row of apartments, a row of houses, and alerts the drugs, that that simple alert is probable cause for the police to get a search warrant. So that, without any other information about -- unlike the earlier case or this one, where the police officer saw the individual being nervous, et cetera, et cetera -- that all -- all it takes is a dog alert, despite the fact that there is no study that says the dogs reliably alert 100 percent of the time? No, I -- I understand. So -- so shouldn't we be addressing the question whether a -- an alert, especially outside a home in particular, should be, standing by itself, enough? Well, only because the officer said that he satisfactorily performed-- --and what the Florida court said: But we don't know what that means. I understood the Florida supreme court, counselor, to say that the deficit in the training records here was because there was no evidence of false positives, that the reports didn't say, the training reports didn't say, if the dog was alerting falsely. Assume that the record, as your adversary claimed, shows the opposite, that a satisfactory completion means that the dog detected drugs where they were. What -- why wouldn't the training records here be adequate in that circumstance? I -- I guess what I'm asking you is, as a matter of law you want us to hold that training records are inadequate unless what? Unless -- you're going to specify now a list of things they have to include? Counsel, how is that any different than a police officer who comes to a car and smells marijuana? He's never going to know whether there is any more in the car or not. It could have been smoked up an hour before. I don't know how long marijuana lingers for, but -- I'm not sure why residual odor affects the reliability of the dog, which was Justice Scalia's point. It's no different than an officer who smells something. He doesn't actually know whether it's physically still present or not, but we're talking about probabilities. ",mr garre i think all of these training facility we be private entity that contract with police department could i go back to justice ginsburg s question there be no what i hear read the florida court say be there be no national standard for certification that be correct there be no national standard that define what be adequate training correct so let me just finish my question so assume there be no national standard then how do you expect a judge without ask question about the content of the certification process the content of the training process and what the result we be and how

2012,United States v. Windsor,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Who else is going to be aggrieved if she is not? Meaning another person who is -- whose benefits are withheld, tax refund is withheld, is going to be in an identical situation to her? Who else could come in? Counsel, could you not run out of time on the BLAG standing? I know we -- we didn't permit Ms. Jackson to -- to address it. So don't run out of time on that. All right. Let's go to the BLAG issue. And the issue wasn't joined. So what do you think we meant? And I know Justice Scalia doesn't care what you think we meant. But what is your reading of what that means, that Congress can-- --intervene in situations in which its interests are injured? So are you accepting the amici's formulation that somehow the representative has to be of both houses and not just one? So you take the position that Congress-- --Well, I want to know what you're conceding. Let's assume this very case. Would -- who would ever have standing on behalf of Congress? Anyone? Or are you saying there's never standing? Mr. Clement, Chadha was somewhat different because there was a unique House prerogative in question. But how is this case any different than enforcing the general laws of the United States? There's no unique House power granted by the legislation. It's a law of the United States and the person who defends it generally is the Solicitor -- Solicitor General. Well, then, why shouldn't -- why shouldn't taxpayers have a right to come in? And we say they don't. Can you tell me where the authorization is here? I know that there is a statute that gives the Senate specifically authorization to intervene and that there was consideration of extending that right to the House. But the appointment of BLAG is strange to me, because it's not in a statute, it's in a House rule. So where -- how does that constitute anything other than a private agreement among some Senators, the House leadership? And where -- from where do they derive the right, the statutory right, to take on the power of representing the House in items outside of the House? I know they control the procedures within the House, but that's a very different step from saying that they can decide who or to create standing in some way, prudential or otherwise, Article III or otherwise. What other House Rule creates the power of the majority leaders to represent the House outside of the functions of the House? This would be, I think, sort of unheard of, that-- --We don't even have a vote here. But only if the State recognizes it. And so there is a common law, Federal common law definition? I thought it was reverse, that if the State law recognized common law marriages, the Federal law-- --But that's begging the question, because you are treating the married couples differently. You are saying that New York's married couples are different than Nebraska's. I picked that out of a hat. But the point is that there is a difference. But what gives the Federal Government the right to be concerned at all at what the definition of marriage is? Sort of going in a circle. You're saying -- you're saying, we can create this special category -- men and women -- because the States have an interest in traditional marriage that they're trying to protect. How do you get the Federal Government to have the right to create categories of that type based on an interest that's not there, but based on an interest that belongs to the States? So they can create a class they don't like -- here, homosexuals -- or a class that they consider is suspect in the marriage category, and they can create that class and decide benefits on that basis when they themselves have no interest in the actual institution of marriage as marriage. The State's control that. No, I'm -- I'm-- --Assuming I assume the States can-- --what creates the right-- General Verrilli, I have a question. You think, I think from your brief yesterday and today, that on some level sexual orientation should be looked on an intermediate standard of scrutiny? All right, heightened in some way. Going back to the Chief's question about a law that was passed recognizing common law heterosexual -- homosexual marriages. I think even under your theory that might be suspect because -- that law might be suspect under equal protection, because once we say sexual orientation is suspect, it would be suspect whether it's homosexual or heterosexual. The law favors homosexuals; it would be suspect because it's based on sexual orientation. Exactly. And so when we decided race was a suspect class, people who are not blacks have received-- --strict scrutiny on whether the use of race as a class, whether they are white or a black, is justified by a compelling interest. General, your bottom line is, it's an equal protection violation for the Federal Government, and all States as well? Is there any argument you can make to limit this to this case, vis-à-vis the Federal Government and not the States? Now, the -- the discriminations are not the sexual orientation, but on a class of marriage; is that what you're-- --So I pose the same question I posed to the General to you. Do you think there's a difference between that discrimination and -- and the discrimination of States who say homosexuals can't get married? ",who else be go to be aggrieve if she be not mean another person who be whose benefit be withhold tax refund be withhold be go to be in an identical situation to her who else could come in counsel could you not run out of time on the blag standing i know we we do not permit ms jackson to to address it so do not run out of time on that all right let us go to the blag issue and the issue be not

right general verrilli i have a question you think i think from your brief yesterday and today that on some level sexual orientation should be look on an intermediate standard of scrutiny all right heighten in some way go back to the chief s question about a law that be pass recognize common law heterosexual homosexual marriage i think even under your theory that might be suspect because that

2012,Maryland v. King,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"And I'm having a hard time understanding the bail argument. Because in my time, most bail decisions were made at the time of arrest. And here the arrest was in April and the results didn't come up until August. And yet, he was detained anyway, correct? And -- and there might be a case where someone's gotten out, but it would be the rare case. You don't use it routinely for the bail determination. Well, it doesn't include the time to collect the sample, send it to you or the time to do the match. It's just to do the genome rapid, correct? All right. So now, I see two lines of cases, okay? The Fourth Amendment, which says you can't do a search without a warrant and probable cause. And Samson. And most of your brief argument was based on Samson. As I read Samson, it was the special relationship between the parolee or the probationary person, that line of cases, and the assumption being that they're out in the world, I think, by the largesse of the State. So a State has a right to search their home just as it would their cell essentially. Why is that true for an arrestee? What about -- what creates this special relationship that permits you to intrude, search their home, search their car, search their person, to solve other cases? Because you're going to have to tell me why searching their person is different than searching their home or car. There's no other case but Samson in that line that permits searches on this balancing. So what I want to know is what's the legal theory now? How far do we let the State go each time it has some form of custody over you in schools, in workplaces, wherever else the State has control over your person? That doesn't explain why you can't go into his home. I mean, you know, if the whole issue is how dangerous is he, you should be able to go into his home, into his car, to any place he has visited, to just sort of run rampant in his life to make sure that he is not a bail risk. But you are, because what you are saying really is law enforcement need alone, without any suspicion whatsoever of another crime, permits you to take this information from the person and use it. The key principle is the Fourth Amendment-- Can we go back to-- --Counsel, so I am really worried about the question you haven't satisfied me with, which is I agree completely that today it's used primarily and almost exclusively for purposes of solving other crimes. But let's -- is this -- the question that I think one of my colleagues asked, is that only because technology hasn't moved fast enough? You said we have to look at the constitutional principles 5 years from now when they will use it to pull up a guy's criminal history. Not unsolved crimes, but criminal history. Get to that day. Tell me what the -- why you would then say that would still be unconstitutional. Right. Let's assume we go under a normal Fourth Amendment, you need probable cause to search. I was interested in a broader thought process, actually. Do you mind giving it to me? Which is, there is something inherently dangerous about DNA collection that is not the same as fingerprinting. ",and I be have a hard time understand the bail argument because in my time most bail decision we be make at the time of arrest and here the arrest be in april and the result do not come up until august and yet he be detain anyway correct and and there might be a case where someone s get out but it would be the rare case you do not use it routinely for the bail determination well it do not include the time to collect the sample send it to you or the time to do the match it be just to do the genome rapid correct all right so now i see two line of case okay the fourth amendment which say you can not do a search without a warrant and probable because and samson and most of your brief argument be base on samson as i read samson it be the special relationship between the parolee or the probationary person that line of case and the assumption be that they be out in the world i think by the largesse of the state so a state have a right to search their home just as it would their cell essentially why be that true for an arrestee what about what create this special relationship that permit you to intrude search their home search their car search their person to solve other case because you be go to have to tell me why search their person be different than search their home or car there be no other case but samson in that line that permit search on this balancing so what i want to know be what be the legal theory now how far do we let the state go each time it have some form of custody over you in school in workplace wherever else the state have control over your person that do not explain why you can not go into his home i mean you know if the whole issue be how dangerous be he you should be able to go into his home into his car to any place he have visit to just sort of run rampant in his life to make sure that he be not a bail risk but you be because what you be say really be law enforcement need alone without any suspicion whatsoever of another crime permit you to take this information from the person and use it the key principle be the fourth amendment can we go back to counsel so i be really worried about the question you have not satisfy me with which be i agree completely that today it be use primarily and almost exclusively for purpose of solve other crime but let us be this the question that i think one of my colleague ask be that only because technology have not move fast enough you say we have to look at the constitutional principle year from now when they will use it to pull up a guy s criminal history not unsolved crime but criminal history get to that day tell me what the why you would then say that would still be unconstitutional right let us assume we go under a normal fourth amendment you need probable because to search i be interested in a broad thought process actually do you mind give it to me which be there be something inherently dangerous about dna collection that be not the same as fingerprinting ,226.45000000000005,Roberts Court,"Feb 26, 2013",Maryland,"Alonzo Jay King, Jr.",12-207,"Nov 9, 2012","Jun 3, 2013",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

2012,PPL Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"See, I have a problem with this argument because it assumes a way of looking at this, but it's an assumption. You can look at it in either way. You can look at it as they made too much money, we want a part of that profit or they paid too little for what they got. And that was the debate going on in Congress. Did they pay too little on the floatation value, or did they make too much money? And what the government says -- rightly -- is, whether you paid too much or too little money depends on the value of the company. And one of the factors that goes into that is how much money has the company made? And so you always have to look at profits to some extent. So what's wrong with looking at it their way? Why does it have to be your way? No, you can only do it your way if you do what the amici says, which is to take out from your simplified equation the fact that the time -- the D element of your equation -- is constant. You artificially freeze it at the time at which they operated. Only by freezing that number can you come out with your equation. But there was at least two or three companies that had a very different period and they paid a huge amount, much further than their gross profits. Because of that, D changed for them. But you change the other part of the equation, or the tax regulation, which says it has to be true for all taxpayers. My fear is, as warned by the government and the tax professors, that the rule you want us to announce to help you win is to say anytime a tax uses estimates of profits, no matter how it does it, it is credible -- creditable. That's the rule you want. So why isn't that to say I want to find the original floatation value, and instead of estimating what the profits are, I'm simply going to use the ones that happen? So why is that different? Well, there is an argument about that because it has two components that you keep ignoring: The floatation value and the time that the company-- --The problem with their argument, Mr. Clement, is that you are undermining your own argument. If they are getting three full years at a lesser tax, it's because their floatation value was made more equal by this formula. So they don't need to be taxed any more moving forward because they got it right. Let's go back to my initial question. What's the rule -- if someone uses your actual profits in any way, it's a credit that they are entitled to? I don't know how you get around it, because you seem to be saying to us that no matter how -- what formula you create, so long as we can simplify it in math to affect which -- take any variables in it and fix them in any way, that's a creditable tax. That seems to be what your argument is. No, I'm saying to you that any tax that relies upon actual profits in any way, you say is wrong. No, the floatation value is not fixed; it was different for each company. They only fixed the percentage that they're going to use, but the actual amount paid was different for every company. Could you -- I'm sorry. So you are accepting the position the government made in v. Exxon. You're not disavowing the position you took there. ",see i have a problem with this argument because it assume a way of look at this but it be an assumption you can look at it in either way you can look at it as they make too much money we want a part of that profit or they pay too little for what they get and that be the debate go on in congress do they pay too little on the floatation value or do they make too much money and what the government say rightly be whether you pay too much or too little money depend on the value of the company and one of the factor that go into that be how much money have the company make and so you always have to look at profit to some extent so what be wrong with look at it their way why do it have to be your way no you can only do it your way if you do what the amici say which be to take out from your simplified equation the fact that the time the d element of your equation be constant you artificially freeze it at the time at which they operate only by freeze that number can you come out with your equation but there be at least two or three company that have a very different period and they pay a huge amount much far than their gross profit because of that d change for them but you change the other part of the equation or the tax regulation which say it have to be true for all taxpayer my fear be as warn by the government and the tax professor that the rule you want us to announce to help you win be to say anytime a tax use estimate of profit no matter how it do it it be credible creditable that be the rule you want so why be not that to say i want to find the original floatation value and instead of estimate what the profit be I be simply go to use the one that happen so why be that different well there be an argument about that because it have two component that you keep ignore the floatation value and the time that the company the problem with their argument mr clement be that you be undermine your own argument if they be get three full year at a less tax it be because their floatation value be make more equal by this formula so they do not need to be tax any more moving forward because they get it right let us go back to my initial question what be the rule if someone use your actual profit in any way it be a credit that they be entitle to i do not know how you get around it because you seem to be say to us that no matter how what formula you create so long as we can simplify it in math to affect which take any variable in it and fix them in any way that be a creditable tax that seem to be what your argument be no I be say to you that any tax that rely upon actual profit in any way you say be wrong no the floatation value be not fix it be different for each company they only fix the percentage that they be go to use but the actual amount pay be different for every company could you I be sorry so you be accept the position the government make in v exxon you be not disavow the position you take there ,221.44,Roberts Court,"Feb 20, 2013",PPL Corporation,Commissioner of Internal Revenue,12-43,"Oct 29, 2012","May 20, 2013",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2012,Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Can you tell me why their test wasn't given a patent? I know the method of extraction wasn't, and why. Why would the tests -- would the tests be subject to a patent? Then -- then explain when you said you can't narrow. You said earlier you can't narrow. All right, that individual claim is invalid. But the patent with respect to claims that are not invalid would still stand. The primers and probes stand. That's the whole point, isn't it? The isolation itself is not valuable; it's the use you put the isolation to. That's the answer, isn't it? And so, that is the answer, which is in isolation it has no value. It's just nature sitting there. That's a failure of the patent law. It doesn't patent ideas. Can we go to -- can we go to cDNA a moment? That is artificially created in the laboratory, so it's not bound in nature. It's not taking a gene and snipping something that's in nature. And yet you claim that can't be patented. The introns are taken out, the exons are left in, and they're sequenced together. Give me your brief argument on that. I read your brief, but it is not a product of nature; it's a product of human invention. But that goes to obviousness. That does not in my mind go to the issue of whether it's patent eligible. You may have a very strong argument on obviousness, but why does it not -- it's creating something that's not found in nature at all. Well, that's a separate question-- --about whether this claim is too expansive because it's claiming every 15 nucleotides and nature produces 15 randomly. But assuming the claim was for the entire mutated gene and not the small snippet that they want to capture the whole gene with, that's -- that whole gene without the introns is just not found in nature. Are we fighting over nothing? Are you fighting over nothing? If -- if they can patent this cDNA in the way they have, what does it matter, since it appears as if research has to rely on the cDNA to be effective? I understand-- --I understand why you are saying cDNA is patentable as a subject matter. I am looking at the way the claim is phrased, however, and it says that it's patenting a DNA segment 15 nucleotides long or longer. The reality is that 15 nucleotides doesn't necessarily bridge a sequence that goes between exons. It -- it can -- one exon can be 15 or more sequences long. So are you arguing that this claim as written is sustainable? So you are not taking the position that this claim as written is patentable? Because as I understand it, 15 nucleotides long exists naturally in nature. They get reproduced in that sequence of 15. Is that on the basis of a new extraction process? I -- I have a sort of analytical problem. I find it very, very difficult to conceive how you can patent a sequential numbering system by nature, in the same way that I have a problem in thinking that someone could get a patent on the computer binary code merely because they throw a certain number of things on a piece of paper in a certain order. I always thought that to have a patent you had to take something and add to what nature does. So how do you add to nature when all you are doing is copying its sequence? How do you add to it besides process or use? Look, I can bake-- --I can bake a chocolate chip cookie using natural ingredients -- salt, flour, eggs, butter -- and I create my chocolate chip cookie. And if I combust those in some new way, I can get a patent on that. But I can't imagine getting a patent simply on the basic items of salt, flour and eggs, simply because I've created a new use or a new product from those ingredients. Explain to me-- --why gene sequences, whether in the actual numbers, why gene sequences are not those basic products that you can't patent. That's the cDNA. So I put salt and flour, and that's different? So if I take them apart, now you can get a patent on the salt and now you can get a patent on the flour? Well, I guess-- --But you're not suggesting if you cut off a piece of the liver or a piece of the kidney that that somehow makes that piece patentable. So what's the difference? I mean, if you cut off a piece of the whole in the kidney or liver, you're saying that's not patentable, but you take a gene and snip off a piece, that is? What's the difference between the two-- Is there some value to us striking down isolated DNA and upholding the cDNA? If we were to do what the Government is proposing in this case, what's the consequences? Now, how do you understand Judge Bryson's dissent with respect to cDNA? I think he's saying that a gene created from -- into cDNA as a whole is okay, but that he had a problem with the description of that claim because it included 15 nucleotide long segments or fragments which he says reoccur in nature. Now, I'm making your job harder. How could they write it to do what he thinks would be patentable? So assuming we believe that there is some human invention in this process; whether it's obvious or not, separate question. But he's not creating -- the cDNA is not in nature naturally. So make that assumption. Make the assumption that they can make a claim for it. How do we avoid his problem? I know you are helping your adversary by answering this question. I am putting that aside.

2012,Horne v. Department of Agriculture,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Could I -- could I just stop you on a factual matter-- --because it has confused me. As I look at the captions of the cases, there appear to be two different partnerships: One partnership known as Raisin -- doing business as Raisin Valley Farms -- has Mr. Horne and his wife as the partners. Lassen Valley, the producer -- not the producer, the handler -- has four other: The Hornes plus two other people. So who owns the raisins? Isn't that the first partnership of the husband and wife? And isn't the handler a second partnership that does the business of handling? But the estates have been substituted. So isn't it two legal entities, one who owns and one who handles? One partnership produces, one partnership handles? Well, I don't care if they did or they didn't. I mean, we should know. Are they two separate legal entities? One who produces-- --Well, that's -- you know, in the cat -- you get some limited liability by creating separate entities, so the creature who owns is one partnership, and the -- and the entity that produces, that handles, is a second one. Well, it does to my mind, because what is the claim, assuming that the producer owns -- the producer entity owns the raisins. What exactly is being taken from the handlers? Is it the percentage -- it can't be the raisins because they don't own them. What -- what do they own? What is it that's being taken from the handler entity? All right. So go back. What is the -- what was taken from them -- you're saying it's just the fine, that the fine is a taking or -- what was the interest that they're claiming was taken by the government? They didn't own the raisins, so they get paid a fee for handling. But the problem is that they weren't entitled to that money, meaning they had to pay it over to the producer. The producer was going to pay them a handling fee, but that money didn't belong to them. It belonged to the producers who supplied them with the raisins and expected payment for them-- --if they were sold in the ordinary course. I'm sorry. In the Horne model, the handlers buy, buy the free raisins and then pay the producers, is that what it-- --Oh. So that's the difference in this model; they don't take title to the raisins is what you're saying? All right. Let me -- let me-- --What is -- what is the value in permitting a party who doesn't own property to raise a taking claim on behalf of other people? Meaning, doesn't the system have an interest in ensuring that people comply with their legal obligations, and to the extent that you choose to violate the law the way they have here, that the fine is punitive and not compensatory. Meaning you don't own the raisins, but you were obligated to put raisins aside for someone else. You were their agent and you failed to meet a Government obligation that was independently on you. So I go back to my question: What was the taking? Since you didn't own the raisins, the taking is the fine is what you want to call the taking. But they're not your raisins. Mr. McConnell, in -- in -- if the producers had decided to challenge this as a Tucker Act violation, they would have had to hand over the raisins? Or could they have just held on to the raisins and said, I'm not handing it over until I get just compensation? All right. Well, the point is that under a normal takings claim, you have to hand over your property, you've lost the value, and you want the Government to pay it back to you, correct? Excuse me. Can I-- --All right. It almost seems to me, and I'll ask Mr. McConnell when he gets up at rebuttal, that there is some sort of due process challenge going on here that's been created by the labels they did in this new situation -- in this new business venture. In the normal situation, the handler, I'm being told, would actually have title to the raisins, and they would pay the producers for the raisins. So there would be property taking. In that situation, where the handlers actually own the property, would they be able to raise a taking defense? So they are missing a business opportunity, because they can't take title to those raisins. And yet you're asking-- --This really does sound to me -- and I think that both Justice Scalia and Breyer now are being more and more convinced -- there has to be a place to challenge this scheme. Whether it's a taking -- whether there's a takings claim f. Or the handler, because the handler is being asked to do things-- --The short answer is, yes, reach the merits only if I win. That -- that's really what you want us to do. No, no, no. I need to ask you this question, because do you want us to reach the merits if we're going to have you lose? You got to want one or the other. Do you want us to reach the merits, period, is really the question. Do you think we should reach the merits, which is a very different question? Only if you win, right? Well, they've conceded that it doesn't apply to handlers. Yes, and so they've conceded there is no-- ",could i could i just stop you on a factual matter because it have confuse me as i look at the caption of the case there appear to be two different partnership one partnership know as raisin do business as raisin valley farm have mr horne and his wife as the partner lassen valley the producer not the producer the handler have four other the horne plus two other people so who own the raisin be not that the first partnership of the husband and wife and be not the handler a second partnership that do the business of handle but the estate have be substitute so be not it two legal entity one who own and one who handle one partnership produce one partnership handle well i do not care if they do or they do not i mean we should know be they two separate legal entity one who produce well that be you know in the cat you get some limited liability by create separate entity so the creature who own be one partnership and the and the entity that produce that handle be a second one well it do to my mind because what be the claim assume that the producer own the producer entity own the raisin what exactly be be take from the handler be it the percentage it can not be the raisin because they do not own them what what do they own what be it that be be take from the handler entity all right so go back what be the what be take from them you be say it be just the fine that the fine be a taking or what be the interest that they be claim be take by the government they do not own the raisin so they get pay a fee for handle but the problem be that they be not entitle to that money mean they have to pay it over to the producer the producer be go to pay them a handle fee but that money do not belong to them it belong to the producer who supply them with the raisin and expect payment for them if they we be sell in the ordinary course I be sorry in the horne model the handler buy buy the free raisin and then pay the producer be that what it oh so that be the difference in this model they do not take title to the raisin be what you be say all right let me let me what be what be the value in permit a party who do not own property to raise a taking claim on behalf of other people meaning do not the system have an interest in ensure that people comply with their legal obligation and to the extent that you choose to violate the law the way they have here that the fine be punitive and not compensatory meaning you do not own the raisin but you we be obligate to put raisin aside for someone else you we be their agent and you fail to meet a government obligation that be independently on you so i go back to my question what be the taking since you do not own the raisin the taking be the fine be what you want to call the taking but they be not your raisin mr mcconnell in in if the producer have decide to challenge this as a tucker act violation they would have have to hand over the raisin or could they have just hold on to the raisin and say I be not hand it over until i get just compensation all right well the point be that under a normal taking claim you have to hand over your property you have lose the value and you want the government to pay it back to you correct excuse me can i all right it almost seem to me and I will ask mr mcconnell when he get up at rebuttal that there be some sort of due process challenge go on here that be be create by the label they do in this new situation in this new business venture in the normal situation the handler I be be tell would actually have title to the raisin and they would pay the producer for the raisin so there would be property taking in that situation where the handler actually own the property would they be able to raise a take defense so they be miss a business opportunity because they can not take title to those raisin and yet you be ask this really do sound to me and i think that both justice scalia and breyer now be be more and more convinced there have to be a place to challenge this scheme whether it be a take whether there have a taking claim f or the handler because the handler be be ask to do thing the short answer be yes reach the merit only if i win that that be really what you want us to do no no no i need to ask you this question because do you want us to reach the merit if we be go to have you lose you get to want one or the other do you want us to reach the merit period be really the question do you think we should reach the merit which be a very different question only if you win right well they have concede that it do not apply to handler yes and so they have concede there be no ,357.66999999999985,Roberts Court,"Mar 20, 2013","Marvin D.

2012,Sekhar v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Clement, what is -- I'm sort of trying to figure out why you're trying to get the word “ property ” to do the work of the “ obtain ” part of the statute, because when you answered Justice Alito you were using the terms of “ obtain ” to define property, which is in my mind a sort of strange way to do things, okay? Property generally means value of some sort and you don't use any of those words in your definition. So, what you're using in my mind, and not illogically, is to say that the second part of the statute has to do some work, so it has to mean that you're taking something of value away from someone else. That makes logical sense to me. And I understand the second piece of your argument, which is the recommendation -- not the recommendation, but his honest services wasn't being given to your client, it was being given to the employer. So your client obtained nothing of value for himself. He didn't get anything transferred to him. And that -- that argument makes eminent sense to me. And I tease it out of your brief, but I don't know why you're trying to get our definition of “ property ” to do that work. Why isn't the work in the “ obtain ” part? So take the Government's definition that property is anything of value. All right. And let's assume, because it -- as I said, that seems to have some sort of conceptual appeal. Then make the argument for me. Then make your argument for me why this isn't an obtaining. I -- I -- going back a little bit to Justice Breyer's question, how do you gain possession of someone's advice or how they do their job when it's not giving you a direct benefit; it's something that belongs to someone else? That's the problem, this obtaining controlled concept. Because you're -- you're equating taking control with possession. And that's where I'm having difficulty. I didn't think they circled recommendation. They circled his honest advice, didn't they? I'm sorry. Mr. Clement, when you finish-- --Let -- look, I think if we take your argument to its logical conclusion, what you are telling us is, do away with the Second Circuit's Tropiano decision, and the large progeny of cases that come from it. The most common is the threat to a business that says pull out of this market because we don't want you in it. And we want all the customers. And courts routinely have said that's a Hobbs Act violation. You're using the threat of force to tell people to keep out of a particular market. Today you are telling us that under your theory of the Hobbs Act and your definition of property, that doesn't count as a Hobbs Act violation. Oh, I think when I sat as a district court judge, I would have been insulted by that. Okay.

2012,Salinas v. Texas,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Fisher, my -- I have a number of problems. The first is your rule would be seen to be giving noncustodial defendants more rights than those defendants in custody, because you're arguing that -- I think -- that a greater degree of expression other than silence would be needed to show the invocation of the privilege against self-incrimination. Or are you trying to equate the rights that a defendant has to custodial and noncustodial with respect to invocation? The problem -- I have an easier problem understanding this argument with respect -- and I'm going to ask your adversaries -- with respect to the situation in which someone is approached by the police and said, come in and talk to us. I have a hard time understanding how the refusal to come talk to them could be held against them. There I understand it. But here, your defendant went in and talked. So once he chose to do that, why does he get more rights than Berghuis did, who remained silent for 2-1/2 hours? The Court wasn't willing to find that that was an invocation of the privilege against self-incrimination. Why would it find the refusal to ask one -- answer one question indicative of the privilege against silence -- or the privilege for silence? How would you deal with another comment situation where a defendant meets up with the police, gives a story, and then later changes the story. And the question is asked at trial, you never volunteered that story to the police when they questioned you. Would that be silence, to you? Would that be an invocation of his right not to incriminate himself, or would you -- would the prosecutor be barred from arguing to the jury, as often is done, he chose to say this but not that, so this is a made-up story. Though sometimes they come back and later do a different confession. I -- I'm assuming, now that I'm thinking about your argument, you would argue that even in a custodial setting a prosecutor couldn't say, I asked him did he shoot his wife, and the prosecutor can't argue that because he refused to answer that makes him guilty. Well, in fact, at most trials, district court judges tell juries the evidence is not the unanswered question, it's the question plus the answer. I guess, as I understand your rule -- I'm sorry. I'll ask it on rebuttal. But why, counsel? I mean, really what you're saying is, merely because I asked you the question and you choose not to answer it makes you guilty. It -- no problem. Here you're asking about the crime of investigation. But you could have asked him, did you kill Joe Blow on another street, and if he had remained silent you would be arguing that proves he is guilty, I could introduce that at trial. And you would be arguing it would be sufficient to convict him; that you merely asked the question and he remained silent about it shows his guilty. It's a little scary to me that an unanswered question is evidence of guilt. He is not arguing that the physical response is not admissible. He is just arguing that the mere asking of a question and a failure to answer it, you can't argue as a prosecutor that that shows someone is guilty. Your -- my hypothetical that I posed earlier, if the police call you and say come in for questioning and you ignore them, is that an invocation of the right to silence or not? Why could you argue that that's-- --They -- they're arguing what the legal theory of guilt is in that situation. All right. So why is it -- would it be admissible that someone decides -- someone comes in and they say, police say to him or her we are investigating this crime, help us. They start asking questions and it's clear from the first question -- there is a waiver of Miranda and from the first question, the first question is, did you kill this person? The guy remains silent, they ask a whole bunch of other questions and he remains silent. Has he invoked his right? So a prosecutor could go into the jury and say he waived his Miranda rights and he is guilty because he refused to answer our questions? Where does the compulsion line come in? Your adversary points out that under this scenario, the police could ask you questions and say to you, you know, if you stay quiet in this question, I'm going to use it against you at trial. That police will actually to that. That they'll actually come in and tell defendants who are telling the story, you know, either answer or it'll be used against you. So why can't you say that a call from a police officer to someone who says come in and talk, that that can't be used against them at trial as -- you gave me a different answer. You said it wasn't probative. But you didn't say Griffin would protect that. That is such a radical position, that silence is an admission of guilty. That's really what the argument is. I certainly understand that speaking can implicate you, and if you choose to speak, clearly whatever you say can be used against you unless you're in custody and unless you've invoke the right before. But this is radically different. We are -- we are -- you're trying to say acts of commission and omission are the same, but statements are different than silence, because then you're making the person who is asking the question your -- your admission. You are saying you're adopting their statement as true. What's not administrable about telling the police you just can't argue to a jury that merely not asking a question is guilt? What -- what lacks administrable? I'll like to go back to what Justice Ginsburg argued, because there is an argument here that there wasn't an invocation of the right, that by physical conduct, there was a statement. Would you have had a problem if the prosecutor had argued at trial, you know, when he was asked about this testing, he didn't remain silent, he got nervous. And that shows his guilt. ",mr fisher my i have a number of problem the first be your rule would be see to be give noncustodial defendant more right than those defendant in custody because you be argue that i think that a

2012,Boyer v. Louisiana,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I -- I think what you -- let's go back to that. It was his view that under Louisiana law to assert his Sixth Amendment right, he had to follow the procedure laid out in the Louisiana rule? Under the Sixth Amendment, he had to comply with the requirements, the procedural requirements of Louisiana. All right. So then how do you -- if he couldn't do it in 2002, '03, '04 or '05, how did he end up doing it in '05? So why didn't he move to quash earlier? I'm sorry. Is there a law or a regulation in -- in Louisiana that gives it a 3-year mark? How about the reasoning, is delay because of the lack of funding attributable to the State or not, or to the district attorney as agent of the State? So what's wrong with what's been suggested by some, to remand to tell the court below to whatever extent this was the basis of your decision, it was wrong. Now redo the Barker, the factors. So is one factor determinative always in this calculation? I thought it was a weighing factor, and so if it's a weighing factor, why isn't that in and of itself a factor that a court needs to weigh against the others? But wait a minute. This is a-- --I'm sorry. Doesn't he say at the same time, I couldn't do the investigation to make the motion required by the State? So didn't that implicate the funding for investigation? Were there funds for investigation? Which funds? Wait a minute. I was told -- maybe I am sort of misreading this record -- that he was ultimately told that fund wouldn't be made available. Counsel, do you want to define constitutionally adequate counsel? Is it anybody who's graduated from Harvard and Yale? [Laughter] Or even just passed the Bar? I would think -- no, no, no. This is a very serious question, which is, I don't know that we have ever defined what the minimum qualification is for qualified counsel. But it is -- some of it has to be that counsel themselves feel adequate to represent a capital defendant. I know plenty of lawyers who would never either volunteer or would resist being appointed to take on that kind of case, because it has many differences to a normal case. She's a very experienced trial counsel. There's no -- no doubt of that, but was she a capital counsel? I'm sorry. What's the difference between saying I'm broke and I want to pay the prosecutor, because they kept paying the prosecutor, I want to pay for the prosecutor's investigation, but I won't pay you? What -- what is the difference in applying the negligence versus deliberate standard? I mean, look, in the end, States are always strapped, but I don't know a State who doesn't make some income. They make a choice about where they want that income to go. And it may be in your judgment a more legitimate decision, but why is the situation less negligent -- why is it negligent and not deliberate? Why is the choice one, not the other. Well, then answer the question. Why isn't the choice to say, I'm broke, so I don't want to pay you, I'm going to pay the prosecutor, which happens -- the prosecutors were being paid throughout. They had enough money to investigate, but we're choosing not to pay the defendants. Why isn't that a deliberate choice? Available funds to pay the lawyer? I'm not going to argue the funding issue because I've got to go look at the record again. But let's assume that the record doesn't support your claim, because as I read the decisions below and the record that I saw there wasn't funding available until I think it was 2006 or '07? And so somehow, there's a disconnect between what you're saying and the record. But let's assume that -- my hypothetical, that there wasn't money despite whatever you're saying. What's your position then? Then it's not deliberate? It's still negligence? So there could never be a systematic breakdown in your judgment, because any time the State gives resources to something else, it's not deliberate -- it's not a systemic breakdown. There was money allocated, but if I understood the record correctly -- by the State -- the funding was grossly inadequate to cover all the needs? As to the murder or as to the independent robbery count? It's not a lesser included offense, the robbery count. ",i i think what you let us go back to that it be his view that under louisiana law to assert his sixth amendment right he have to follow the procedure lay out in the louisiana rule under the sixth amendment he have to comply with the requirement the procedural requirement of louisiana all right so then how do you if he could not do it in or how do he end up do it in so why do not he move to quash early I be sorry be there a law or a regulation in in louisiana that give it a year mark how about the reasoning be delay because of the lack of fund attributable to the state or not or to the district attorney as agent of the state so what be wrong with what be be suggest by some to remand to tell the court below to whatever extent this be the basis of your decision it be wrong now redo the barker the factor so be one factor determinative always in this calculation i think it be a weighing factor and so if it be a weighing factor why be not that in and of itself a factor that a court need to weigh against the others but wait a minute this be a I be sorry do not he say at the same time i could not do the investigation to make the motion require by the state so do not that implicate the funding for investigation we be there fund for investigation which fund wait a minute i be tell maybe i be sort of misread this record that he be ultimately told that fund would not be make available counsel do you want to define constitutionally adequate counsel be it anybody who be graduate from harvard and yale laughter or even just pass the bar i would think no no no this be a very serious question which be i do not know that we have ever define what the minimum qualification be for qualified counsel but it be some of it have to be that counsel themselves feel adequate to represent a capital defendant i know plenty of lawyer who would never either volunteer or would resist be appoint to take on that kind of case because it have many difference to a normal case she be a very experienced trial counsel there be no no doubt of that but be she a capital counsel I be sorry what be the difference between say I be broke and i want to pay the prosecutor because they keep pay the prosecutor i want to pay for the prosecutor s investigation but i will not pay you what what be the difference in apply the negligence versus deliberate standard i mean look in the end state be always strap but i do not know a state who do not make some income they make a choice about where they want that income to go and it may be in your judgment a more legitimate decision but why be the situation less negligent why be it negligent and not deliberate why be the choice one not the other well then answer the question why be not the choice to say I be broke so i do not want to pay you I be go to pay the prosecutor which happen the prosecutor we be be pay throughout they have enough money to investigate but we be choose not to pay the defendant why be not that a deliberate choice available fund to pay the lawyer I be not go to argue the funding issue because I have get to go look at the record again but let us assume that the record do not support your claim because as i read the decision below and the record that i saw there be not fund available until i think it be or and so somehow there be a disconnect between what you be say and the record but let us assume that my hypothetical that there be not money despite whatever you be say what be your position then then it be not deliberate it be still negligence so there could never be a systematic breakdown in your judgment because any time the state give resource to something else it be not deliberate it be not a systemic breakdown there be money allocate but if i understand the record correctly by the state the funding be grossly inadequate to cover all the need as to the murder or as to the independent robbery count it be not a lesser include offense the robbery count ,289.59,Roberts Court,"Jan 14, 2013",Jonathan Edward Boyer,Louisiana,11-9953,"Oct 5, 2012","Apr 29, 2013",113.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2012,McBurney v. Young,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, I'm having-- --Counsel, I'm -- I -- there is underlying your argument a sort of fundamental belief that you are entitled to relief -- pardon the alliteration simply because the statute discriminates between citizens and noncitizens. Is that your position? So if it's not, what are the two rights that you -- or what rights are it that you're claiming have been violated? You say privileges and immunities. What's the privilege or immunity? So is this an as-applied challenge to the-- --All right. So this is an as-applied challenge. I -- I'm having a problem, and then I think it's Justice Ginsburg's problem, which is absent the statute, he can't demand that Virginia provide him with this information because that's how he wants to work, correct? So what's the added value that gives him a right to demand it merely because a statute exists? He doesn't have a right to the information. I'm still trying to tease out what your claim is. Let's suppose Virginia passes a statute that says: We'll let nonresidents have access, but they have to pay all the costs. Nonresidents don't. Would that satisfy you as valid? Why isn't it just -- you just being costs them more? That was Justice Ginsburg's point, which is every time you've put in a request, you're costing them more money. Well, why? You were costing them more. I'm not sure how you save administrative costs under this statute. They could go to any Virginia resident, it's not illegal, and probably will, it'll cost them something more, but not you, and get the very same information. So how do you justify this discrimination? Because it's so easily -- the administrative cost is going to be imposed anyway. So you want to give more businesses to Virginia citizens who will now charge out-of-State residents money to process their FOIA requests? You keep making that argument. But you don't stop residents for asking for the information from someone else. I mean, that's one of the points of your law, which is, they can hire a Virginia resident to get it for them. Most of the big people are doing that already. So you're not saving any money if they can get the information simply by paying someone in Virginia to get it for them. Only in his Privileges and Immunities Clause claim. He claims that the Dormant Commerce Clause has been effected because he reads this statute as saying only Virginia recording companies have access. Out-of-State can't. And it's a fair reading of the statute. It only permits Virginia residents, which include commercial and noncommercial, to access the information. So assume hypothetically that the statute reads ""only Virginia commercial businesses have access to this information-- "" --Well, that's the question I'm -- I'm raising the best argument for your adversary, okay? Because we could call it a direct -- he calls it direct discrimination, because commercial businesses are being permitted in Virginia but not noncommercial. You say it's indirect. How do we draw the line between direct and indirect when the bottom-line consequence is the same? So why doesn't the dormant Commerce Clause affect the hypothetical I laid out? Because directly this permits Virginia commercial businesses to get something that out-of-staters can't. The State is putting this instrument into commerce. You say, I don't know that. But make the assumption that we think the record's clear enough on that point. I know you want to fight me on that, but it's hard -- it's a fight with no legs. Because you have to know that commercial enterprises in Virginia seek these records. Tell us under our jurisprudence, the dormant Common Commerce jurisprudence -- I have colleagues who don't -- who don't believe it should exist. Take that argument out. Why is this not a dormant Commerce Clause case?

2012,Chafin v. Chafin,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"What you're saying is the return of the child essentially back to Alabama. And so once the child is back in Alabama, that's the remedy, then the State court would be seized of jurisdiction sufficient then to determine the habitual residence. Whatever the State -- well, presumably the child only comes back if you win. So presuming you win, the child would come back, and the Alabama courts could then seize the custody determination. Was their reasoning that the child was initially removed properly because there had been an order permitting the mother to go? So it was a lawful removal at that moment. And what they're saying is, since the case is moot, nothing has vacated the order, but it didn't make her action illegal? It's a stand-still order there. Counsel, there is a judgment against your client, isn't there, for $94,000 or so? Could you break down that figure? So-- --Counsel, that cost that you have to pay for the mother, even though the case was mooted, that judgment is still outstanding for the moneys you have to pay? If you win on this appeal, is that wiped out? Counsel, what's -- what happens-- --Can you tell me what's happening, what is the status? Given the vacated return custody order -- return order, will the Scottish court ever determine habitual residence? But that order has been vacated, so can they revisit that question is really the -- the issue. And at the Hague, it's what was it then. Could I ask a question? Does it matter? Meaning, whether a stay is granted or not, you are, I don't think, taking the position that only if the stay is granted is the court of appeals seized of jurisdiction. You're saying the case is not moot, correct? All right. Now, under the Convention, if the child -- if it goes back to the district court now to fashion a remedy, it could order return, it could decide under the Convention that bringing the child back after 14 months presents a great risk to the child under the Convention and not order the return, correct? So we just don't know what the court's going to do, but some form of relief is possible. That's why you used the word “ possible ”. But they have the power, if they choose it, but they don't have to choose it; that's the bottom line, correct? Are you aware of -- I happen to be because I know this area very well -- the English courts have an amici filed with us yesterday, and they are sort of sensibly keeping track of what we're doing and trying to adjust their proceedings accordingly and in the manner they think is most helpful to us. Whether it is or not, I can't comment on. Is this common in the custody area? Is there discussions between courts about what they're doing and the why of it? And it's required. There is a whole system set up now, right? Why can't they order the mother to come back with the child? Because the Scottish court stops her? There is competing orders all the time. Why not? She was here. She submitted to the Court's jurisdiction. Doesn't her -- jurisdiction over her now continue until the end of the case? That doesn't matter. The question is, isn't she seized -- doesn't the Court have jurisdiction over her until the case ends? The case doesn't end until there has been an appeal and a judgment and the judgment affirmed or reversed. That hasn't happened. You are suggesting that the Convention deprives a party, after the remedy's been ordered and effected, of the right to appeal; not because of mootness, but because the Convention takes away a fundamental right to appeal? You're not going to suggest all those countries that permit appeals explicitly and stop removals until appeals are finished, that those -- that those those treaty -- contracting treaty parties are breaching the Convention, are you? Counsel, that -- that actually is not accurate. The Convention is full of conditions for the return: The safety of the child, the support of the parent who is returning -- there is a whole set of conditions that have to be met before the child is returned. I happen to think that one could argue that returning back to the court that had -- was making the decision after an appeal is raised, that that's an inherent condition of a return order. But that -- you're arguing against that, but there are plenty of conditions that could be imposed. No. You can't -- the Court can't order custody issues, but it can set conditions for the nature of the return. It could say the father pays the cost; the father has to pay for certain expenses in the country the child is being sent to; those kinds of conditions can be imposed. Excuse me, can I just-- --But asking is not enough. Because the mother can get on the plane the moment she hears that someone's asked. Isn't there a Spanish case? Isn't there a Spanish case? Not a Scottish; Spain, a case from Spain. Where the child was, in fact, returned when-- --Counsel, there is an amici brief here that says that the Scottish courts will not pay attention to the habitual residence of a child at the time of the removal. The amici brief that was filed with us yesterday, if I'm reading it correctly, suggests that the court believes that hasn't been settled in English law; is that correct? That that -- so that proposition is not as settled as the amici suggests? ",what you be say be the return of the child essentially back to alabama and so once the child be back in alabama that be the remedy then the state court would be seize of jurisdiction sufficient then to determine the habitual residence whatever the state well presumably the child only come back if you win so presume you win the child would come back and the alabama court could then seize the custody determination be their reasoning that the child be initially remove properly because there have be an order permit the mother to go so it be a lawful removal at that moment and what they be say be since the case be moot nothing have vacate the order but it do not make her action illegal it be a stand still order there counsel there be a judgment against your client be not there for or so could you break down that figure so counsel that cost that you have to pay for the mother even though the case be moot that judgment be still outstanding for the money you have to pay if you win on this appeal be that wipe out counsel what be what happen can you tell me what be happen what be the status give the vacated return custody order return order will the scottish court ever determine habitual residence but that order have be vacate so can they revisit that question be really the the issue and at the hague it be what be it then could i ask a question do it matter meaning whether a stay be grant or not you be i do not think take the position that only if the stay be grant be the court of appeal seize of jurisdiction you be say the case be not moot correct all right now under the convention if the child if it go back to the district court now to fashion a remedy it could order return it could decide under the convention that bring the child back after month present a great risk to the child under the convention and not order the return correct so we just do not know what the court s go to do but some form of relief be possible that be why you use the word possible but they have the power if they choose it but they do not have to choose it that be the bottom line correct be you aware of i happen to be because i know this area very well the english court have an amici file with us yesterday and they be sort of sensibly keep track of what we be do and try to adjust their proceeding accordingly and in the manner they think be most helpful to us whether it be or not i can not comment on be this common in the custody area be there discussion between court about what they be do and the why of it and it be require there be a whole system set up now right why can not they order the mother to come back with the child because the scottish court stop her there be compete order all the time why not she be here she submit to the court s jurisdiction do not her jurisdiction over her now continue until the end of the case that do not matter the question be be not she seize do not the court have jurisdiction over her until the case end the case do not end until there have be an appeal and a judgment and the judgment affirm or reverse that have not happen you be suggest that the convention deprive a party after the remedy s be order and effect of the right to appeal not because of mootness but because the convention take away a fundamental right to appeal you be not go to suggest all those country that permit appeal explicitly and stop removal until appeal be finish that those that those those treaty contract treaty party be breach the convention be you counsel that that actually be not accurate the convention be full of condition for the return the safety of the child the support of the parent who be return there be a whole set of condition that have to be meet before the child be return i happen to think that one could argue that return back to the court that have be make the decision after an appeal be raise that that be an inherent condition of a return order but that you be argue against that but there be plenty of condition that could be impose no you can not the court can not order custody issue but it can set condition for the nature of the return it could say the father pay the cost the father have to pay for certain expense in the country the child be be send to those kind of condition can be impose excuse me can i just but ask be not enough because the mother can get on the plane the moment she hear that someone s ask be not there a spanish case be not there a spanish case not a scottish spain a case from spain where the child be in fact return when counsel there be an amici brief here that say that the scottish court will not pay attention to the habitual residence of a child at the time of the removal the amici brief that be file with us yesterday if I be read it correctly suggest that the court believe that have not be settle in english law be that correct that that so that proposition be not as settle as the amici suggest ,331.04,Roberts Court,"Dec 5, 2012",Jeffrey L.

2012,"Los Angeles County Flood Control District v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"So why don't we just remand and let it sort it out under the right understanding of the legal rule? Which is basically what the Government is saying, with an added twist because it thinks there is another legal question that I think the Ninth Circuit has answered, but we could go back and forth on it. Everybody agrees. So this was a regulatory void? A regulatory void that these -- that there was no requirement previously that you monitor the outfalls? So how do you envision this permit was -- by the way, just one side question and then to this one. I thought the Ninth Circuit basically endorsed your view that under the permit you're not -- you're only responsible for your own pollution. So it has resolved this issue. All right. So that's why I ask why remand and why you're saying why remand. But putting that aside, how do you think the system was supposed to work before? Did you have any obligation, once you saw the excess pollutants, to start the reiteration process to try to figure out who was the cause of this? You mean the Respondents could have done that here? You just said there were polluters upstream. Are those industrial polluters upstream-- --or industrial facilities, are they within your MS4? But what you're saying is that there are outfalls from different people into the same river. All right. So we don't know whether the outfall is from your MS4 or from some other source? Counsel, tell me why remand? I thought -- and correct me at whatever step I'm wrong, okay -- that the district court rejected Respondents' argument that the mere monitoring excesses created liability. What it said is you have to follow the terms of the permit and make the permittee responsible only for their excess discharges, and you haven't shown us any evidence that does that. The Ninth Circuit agreed that the permittee is only liable for its own discharges. It held the permittee liable because it believed that the discharges were within their source, within their outflow. So what are we remanding for? The legal question of whether the -- the -- the monitoring stations automatically create liability has been answered in the negative by both courts. How would it-- --what could it do differently? How does that change the answer to the legal question that the permittee -- both courts have said the permittee is only liable for their own discharges. And unless this proves that they discharged, they themselves discharged, which it can't because it's in the river and not within the source-- --how can that alone establish liability? Why should we in light of the clarity of the permit? That's the question Justice Scalia is asking. I just don't remember now. Do we have a circuit split on this issue of whether a permit in a situation like this would impose liability on all permittees?

2012,Evans v. Michigan,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Do we give credence to how the judge labels what the acquittal is? But you don't-- --How would they do that? I'd like to go back to Justice Kennedy's question. It's easy when you have a jury, because what happens is a judge can decide whether at the end of the prosecution's case he's going to dismiss for insufficiency, or he can give it to the jury, and if the jury renders a verdict, set it aside. Jeopardy attaches only if the judge dismisses the case after the prosecution's judgment, but not if he sets aside the verdict, correct? In the latter. So what can a State do -- some have done something -- to ensure that even if jeopardy has attached, that there can be a valid reversal; the judge is wrong on a legal theory. So give us an example of what, in a judge trial, a State could do to ensure that a legally wrong judgment is still reversible. In a bench trial. What could it do? I thought there were in your briefs some examples -- in someone's brief, there were some examples-- --No, forget about a jury trial. Let's go to the bench trial. You're not helping your argument by saying there's nothing a State could ever do. Do you know something, Counselor? You're sinking your hole deeper. You're not helping yourself in this argument, because how does that help the system? I don't disagree. You mean no State could ever say to a judge, given -- given -- render a verdict on the prosecution's theory, and then set it aside? If you think the theory is not legally-- --You keep saying “ mid-trial ”. What -- what is not mid-trial? Some States require a judge to wait. What happens in those States? I keep talking not about jury verdicts, but about bench trials. I want to focus on the bench trial process. I'm sorry, I'm a little confused. It was charged with the crime of burning down a dwelling, correct? Of? And no specific statute was cited? Which one? The dwelling statute, not the exception to the dwelling. That's what he was charged with? So why did the court dismiss if he was charged with burning down a house? I thought he was charged with burning down a dwelling, and the argument was he should have been-- --charged with burning down a house. My only quibble is, you have no doubt -- the defense attorney had no doubt that he burnt down a house. That someone burnt down a house, correct? Got it. It's a sentencing enhancement, is really what the argument is, the decision was. That every -- you can be charged with burning down a dwelling and you can only get the enhancement if they prove it's a house. Exactly. But many states have a different rule. And many states permit the judge to reserve it till after the jury verdict. Counsel, you gave us earlier the statistics of how many judges grant Rule 29 motions in trial. I think you said 76 percent. What's the gross number relative to the number of actual verdict decisions by juries or the judge himself? Out of what number? ",do we give credence to how the judge label what the acquittal be but you do not how would they do that I would like to go back to justice kennedy s question it be easy when you have a jury because what happen be a judge can decide whether at the end of the prosecution s case he be go to dismiss for insufficiency or he can give it to the jury and if the jury render a verdict set it aside jeopardy attach only if the judge dismiss the case after the prosecution s judgment but not if he set aside the verdict correct in the latter so what can a state do some have do something to ensure that even if jeopardy have attach that there can be a valid reversal the judge be wrong on a legal theory so give us an example of what in a judge trial a state could do to ensure that a legally wrong judgment be still reversible in a bench trial what could it do i think there we be in your brief some example in someone s brief there we be some example no forget about a jury trial let us go to the bench trial you be not help your argument by say there be nothing a state could ever do do you know something counselor you be sink your hole deeper you be not help yourself in this argument because how do that help the system i do not disagree you mean no state could ever say to a judge give give render a verdict on the prosecution s theory and then set it aside if you think the theory be not legally you keep say mid trial what what be not mid trial some state require a judge to wait what happen in those state i keep talk not about jury verdict but about bench trial i want to focus on the bench trial process I be sorry I be a little confused it be charge with the crime of burn down a dwelling correct of and no specific statute be cite which one the dwell statute not the exception to the dwelling that be what he be charge with so why do the court dismiss if he be charge with burn down a house i think he be charge with burn down a dwelling and the argument be he should have be charge with burn down a house my only quibble be you have no doubt the defense attorney have no doubt that he burn down a house that someone burn down a house correct get it it be a sentencing enhancement be really what the argument be the decision be that every you can be charge with burn down a dwelling and you can only get the enhancement if they prove it be a house exactly but many state have a different rule and many state permit the judge to reserve it till after the jury verdict counsel you give us earlier the statistic of how many judge grant rule motion in trial i think you say percent what be the gross number relative to the number of actual verdict decision by jury or the judge himself out of what number ,197.1,Roberts Court,"Nov 6, 2012",Lamar Evans,Michigan,11-1327,"Jun 11, 2012","Feb 20, 2013",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2012,Maracich v. Spears,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Does it create an exception for research? Let's assume that a university wanted to do a research project and it needs subjects. I get solicited for it all the time. Does this exception apply to them, too? It says surveys, not just marketing or solicitations. I mean, there is a commercial component, but there appears to be a noncommercial component as well. Does that apply to the States, too, when they want to market against drunk driving, they want to market against -- for their health insurance processes, versus private processes for State drug provided-- --If the lawyer had said more -- did you buy a car, did you get charged the fee, we're investigating this to determine whether this is -- violates the law. Is that okay? So the only -- the only thing that's bad is to say, come call us for a consultation? So what's the difference between that and how you answered Justice Ginsburg when she said class notice would be okay? Wait a minute. It's joining the class or opting out. And when you join the class, you have a commercial relationship with the lawyer no different than being a named plaintiff. You -- you said earlier, and it set me to thinking, that why would in anticipation of litigation permit access to all of this very personal information? And I don't know that, yes, it does permit access, but only in anticipation of litigation. So you have to prove before you get things like Social Security Number, driver -- anything else -- all they asked for was names and addresses, I understand. Well, yes, there is. There is a limitation that you're actually going to use it in relationship to the litigation, number one. And the States are obligated to ensure that what they release is actually covered by one of these exceptions. You have to explain why. No, no, no. As I read, the first one is: We want to see if there is a pattern of overcharging; give us the names and addresses of people who have recently bought a car. That seems to me pretty specific as to what they want and why they need it. And I think it's pretty easy for the State to say -- to-- Mr. Clement, I'm not sure I'm satisfied with the answer you gave to Justice Scalia. He said: Look, we've got to harmonize; instead of general-specific, solicitation of clients is different than investigation, and we just say they're mutually exclusive. It is a little bit of a general and specific. And that's proven by (b)(2), because when (b)(2) wants to permit solicitation it expressly says it and they didn't expressly say solicitation in (4). That's I think your adversary's main argument. And I'm still not sure I'm comfortable with the answer you're giving. You're saying they're independent, but why are they necessarily conflicting? Conflicting, exactly, or conflicting or overlapping. I guess why are they necessarily overlapping? Is there a Federal law to that effect? There may be a Federal law to that effect. Counsel, I just want to, before you leave, because in response to Justice Kagan, I think you've changed positions a little bit. You started by saying there were three ways to draw a line. Getting clients is okay, getting clients is okay if you get a specific treatment, occurrence or defect, and you didn't mention what the third was. So, what's your preferred reading?

2012,Henderson v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Some circuits have even said that. The Second Circuit says that if it's a sentencing error, that the amount of substantial rights and the integrity of fairness of the preceding question is a different balance. Was Justice Breyer essentially correct that in most of the cases where an error is not plain at the time of trial that the third and fourth prong of Olano almost always take care of the issue? I mean, I've been looking for a case in this Court in which more substantial errors than the one that occurred here -- we are going to put aside the fact that I don't see how this Defendant on the third or fourth could ever win, given that he was begging for drug treatment during his sentencing, so how a resentence would affect the fairness or integrity of this proceeding is beyond my understanding. But isn't Justice Breyer right? Well, I would say to you that that's more in keeping with the attitude that Justice Kennedy asked about, which is I think most circuit courts believe the fourth prong is more easily met in sentencing than in trial cases. Whether they are right about that, that's not an issue we are facing today. But why? The very essence of 52(b) is when you don't make an objection. I mean, it's treating two -- it's addressing two different situations; A says when you've made an objection, you just have to prove prejudice; and B says you have to prove that substantial rights are affected. Mr. Wall, why is this whole test, as you're proposing it, dependent on the smartness or not smartness of a particular circuit and the speed with which a particular circuit reaches an issue or doesn't? I mean, this -- basically, what you're saying is we reward the circuits and the judges who don't reach issues, because if the law is unsettled, then if a substantial right is affected, that's so serious that it affects the fairness and integrity of a proceeding, that is not going to result in a reversal. It seems to me that if I'm a district court judge or a circuit court judge or anyone else or a circuit court, I would try to avoid as many issues as I could because there's going to be as little set of reversals as possible. And going back to what Justice Ginsburg said, we take cases where the split is 8 to 1, okay, or 8 to 0, because a particular circuit hasn't gotten to -- to an issue. Does this mean, as Justice Breyer said, that the eight circuits who got it right, the defendants have a Johnson plain-error rule, and the one circuit who just didn't get to it doesn't? But why isn't the focus of the system on the nature of error? But 52(b) is about not making the objection. That's -- that's sort of going around in a circle. Counsel, I guess, I -- I continue to be confused about what makes error plain or clear. I don't know why the pronouncement of a circuit court accomplishes that. Meaning, so we said in Tapia that the statute is perfectly plain, perfectly clear. And so why shouldn't it have been clear to those circuits or to that district court judge at the time of trial? You're equating the plainness of error with what the outcome is to -- in circuit courts, and I'm having trouble with that. I don't understand how you get that from the rule. The rule says any plain error that affects substantial rights, even if it wasn't brought to the judge's attention. ",some circuit have even say that the second circuit say that if it be a sentence error that the amount of substantial right and the integrity of fairness of the precede question be a different balance be justice breyer essentially correct that in most of the case where an error be not plain at the time of trial that the third and fourth prong of olano almost always take care of the issue i mean I have be look for a case in this court in which more substantial error than the one that occur here we be go to put aside the fact that i do not see how this defendant on the third or fourth could ever win give that he be beg for drug treatment during his sentencing so how a resentence would affect the fairness or integrity of this proceeding be beyond my understanding but be not justice breyer right well i would say to you that that be more in keep with the attitude that justice kennedy ask about which be i think most circuit court believe the fourth prong be more easily meet in sentence than in trial case whether they be right about that that be not an issue we be face today but why the very essence of b be when you do not make an objection i mean it be treat two it be address two different situation a say when you have make an objection you just have to prove prejudice and b say you have to prove that substantial right be affect mr wall why be this whole test as you be propose it dependent on the smartness or not smartness of a particular circuit and the speed with which a particular circuit reach an issue or do not i mean this basically what you be say be we reward the circuit and the judge who do not reach issue because if the law be unsettled then if a substantial right be affect that be so serious that it affect the fairness and integrity of a proceeding that be not go to result in a reversal it seem to me that if I be a district court judge or a circuit court judge or anyone else or a circuit court i would try to avoid as many issue as i could because there be go to be as little set of reversal as possible and go back to what justice ginsburg say we take case where the split be to okay or to because a particular circuit have not get to to an issue do this mean as justice breyer say that the eight circuit who get it right the defendant have a johnson plain error rule and the one circuit who just do not get to it do not but why be not the focus of the system on the nature of error but b be about not make the objection that be that be sort of go around in a circle counsel i guess i i continue to be confuse about what make error plain or clear i do not know why the pronouncement of a circuit court accomplish that meaning so we say in tapia that the statute be perfectly plain perfectly clear and so why should not it have be clear to those circuit or to that district court judge at the time of trial you be equate the plainness of error with what the outcome be to in circuit court and I be have trouble with that i do not understand how you get that from the rule the rule say any plain error that affect substantial right even if it be not bring to the judge s attention ,254.38000000000005,Roberts Court,"Nov 28, 2012",Armarcion D.

2012,Comcast v. Behrend,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Estrada, could you pronounce for me or give me the legal rule as you want us to articulate it? Let me get you out of Daubert, okay, because I think you really can't deny that you never raised the word “ Daubert ” below until the very end. Your fight before the district court was on the probity of the model, not on a Daubert issue, correct? Did you use the word “ Daubert ” before the district court? Okay. So you didn't use “ Daubert ” below-- --so let's get out of the Daubert language, okay? Tell me how and what rule we announce so that district courts find an expert's evidence probative, the other side argues it's not, and when does the district court let the jury decide between the two? Where is the line that the district court draws between class certification and merits adjudication so that at some point it goes to the jury? Excuse me, do you think -- that -- that's why I am trying to get away from magic words. Why do you disagree with the simple proposition that a district court, by whatever magic words it uses, has to come to the conclusion that the expert's testimony is persuasive? And isn't that at bottom line a judgment that it's reliable and probative? So you are not disagreeing with your adversary on a legal standard. Every judge on a -- this is the simple way I formulate the rule -- every judge before he certifies -- he or she certifies a class, has to decide whether the methods being used are probative and relevant, sufficient to prove common -- common question of damages. Counsel, tell me -- you articulate for me what you think -- what the district court found when it accepted your expert's theory as adequate. What do you think that means legally? And so what does sufficiently persuasive mean? It sounds nice, but more likely than not-- --Counsel, the bottom line is, can a district court ever say that it's persuaded by unreliable or not probative evidence. That's really the bottom line question. Does it commit legal error when it finds something that's unreliable and unpersuasive or unprobative? I -- I think that's a fair reading of what he said-- --but if we're answering a legal question. The problem everyone's having is -- I think -- that why do you need Daubert to point out that something is not probative or unreliable?

2012,American Trucking Associations v. City of Los Angeles,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Can I break down your arguments into two components, if you might? Whether or not the market participant exception exists at all; and if it does, how far does it go? So, let's get to the first question in my mind. Seems almost impossible for me to believe that the States couldn't require someone to put a little placard like you get at the -- at almost any building that you go into to park your car. They ask you to put a little placard in the front of your window so they know who you are and where you're going in the Port, okay? Why is the placard requirement here any different than that requirement generally? Because if you enter property, you have -- most people tell you put a placard in the window to tell us you got permission to come in. But even if that, if we didn't have a market participant, why couldn't the State say: When you come into the terminal, you just got to put a little placard in so we know that you're not parking here overnight when you've already been unloaded or something else? Could the terminal say, we have a pollution problem and only modern trucks can come and unload here? So they have to take trucks that are too heavy for this crane to lift? Except in Boston Harbor, we said that there was a presumption in favor of it unless Congress explicitly indicated to the contrary. Do we need to get into the market exception if we find that this is -- has the force or effect of law rather than being a private contract? It's one or the other -- or both, but we could choose. Do you think the city could pass a regulation like as Justice Breyer suggested, that says, stay off residential streets? So you -- do you think that a statute that says if you're trucking company operator and you have three violations of X safety regulations, you just can't use our highways because we don't trust you, is that okay? Why? Why isn't it a standard fact that States and cities use to stop people from repetitive violations to tell them, if you keep doing this and don't remedy what you've done, we're just not going to let you do X, Y, and Z? Why wouldn't the safety violate-- Could I just go back, because-- --the theoretical questions. The agreement requires the operators to have offsite parking. All right? It has to do that for a reason. It means that if its trucks don't use that offsite parking, that the operator is in default? Is that the City's position? I just wanted to make sure. What you're saying is if trucks park anywhere else, then the operator's in violation of the agreement. All right. With respect to the placard, as I read the provision it says you have to have the placard coming in and going out. Is this like one of those parking placards that people can affix temporarily or does it have to be a permanent? Well, how does that help you? Meaning to-- --So how is the public going to use that plaque? How is the public going to use that? The public hangs around the Port as it's loading to call in complaints?

2012,Smith v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Isn't that like an amnesty? Isn't that how you described it in your brief? What is the difference between the two in your mind that makes it an element of the crime or a negation of some element of the crime? So you are a member, you are liable for all the foreseeable acts of your coconspirators, whether or not you knew they were going to happen, so long as they were foreseeable? And you can be liable for as long as you stay until you prove you withdrew. And that extinguishes your liability for the continuing conspiracy. Why? The why is, once you've joined, you are trying to extinguish liability. Why would the Government have to prove that you're entitled to amnesty or not entitled to amnesty? I actually thought your stronger argument in your brief was in trying to explain why it negated an element. I think what you said in your brief, and you haven't made it here yet, as clearly, was that if he wasn't willingly participating during the statute of limitations, then he hadn't committed the actual crime. Counsel, in a normal case where it's a robbery or burglary, whatever, you charge the crime happened in X date, and the defendant raises an affirmative defense that it's not within the statute of limitations. Who bears the burden of proving it does, in that situation? All right. So, if you bear the burden in the normal statute of limitations case, the issue, I think, in my mind, becomes, do you continue to bear that burden in a conspiracy crime? Because -- and you still have to prove -- you're saying that the elements of the statute of limitation there are that there was an agreement to commit a crime, this person joined it at any time during the conspiracy, and the conspiracy continues. You don't have to prove that the defendant was part of that conspiracy or joined that conspiracy during the statute of limitations; that's your point. I think his intuitive argument is, I can't be responsible for a crime I wasn't a part of during the limitations period. That really is the essence of his argument, and if it's your job to prove that he committed the -- a robbery during the limitations period, that it's your job to prove that he committed the conspiracy during -- that he was part -- that the conspiracy -- that he was part of the conspiracy during the limitations period-- --I think that that's the simplicity of his argument. So simplify your response to me. [Laughter] That's not a simple response. [Laughter] You are already way too fast.

2012,Gunn v. Minton,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"So does that mean that if the claim in the malpractice action is that the PTO acted unconstitutionally -- assume that set of facts -- how does that change your analysis? So go back to -- you were going through a list of questions, and I posited, let's assume that the malpractice claim does involve a constitutional question. Then what other factors-- --How about fraud on -- a claim of fraud on -- that the malpractice was fraud on the PTO? Lawyer loses that. It's been litigated. Isn't it res judicata, and won't it affect the patent or might it not affect the patent in a patent action? I find that somewhat hard to follow. Let's assume in adjudicating a medical -- a malpractice claim, the State court finds that the attorney suppressed information. It's a finding of fact. He has this information in his or her file, and they didn't disclose it. I'm not quite sure how the PTO ignores that litigation. Or the district court does, if it gets to review that in a later action. I'm only raising this question to address Justice Scalia's point. You're asking for an absolute rule, and I posited a situation where I think it's not so clear that a State court finding might not have an effect. So, do we have to go to your absolute rule? Then immigration law. Don't get in the weeds. Take immigration law. So patent law cases of malpractice are smaller in number than copyright cases-- Immigration and other exclusive jurisdictions, so that's okay to remove, but those others aren't? --Does that make a whole lot of sense? Well, how about a different one, the one that's being proposed by your adversary, which is define “ substantial ” as to how it affects Federal law, which I think was the bottom line -- or the development of Federal law, the bottom line of Grable. And she says -- you dispute this in your brief -- that it doesn't affect the invalidated patent, that there's no way that a judgment on the malpractice is going to be used in a continuation patent dispute because it's not one of the listed preclusive courts. So, how does a ruling affect patent law? Why is -- who's going to follow it? Besides the parties-- --how else does it affect the development of patent law? Who else is going to follow-- --this malpractice determination? So what you're arguing, they're going to make a mistake, and because we might not accept certiorari, that's binding on everybody else-- --in the State-- --I'm sorry. How does it -- the patent's invalid. The patent's invalid. Nothing the Court does here is going to change that invalidity. That's what I don't understand. He's not going to get his patent back from this action. He's going to get money for losing it, maybe. So how does it affect the patent? We're back to that issue, okay. Could you answer the one point your adversary raised that gives me pause, a lot of pause. He says a ruling on patent law of how you should or should not behave in a State malpractice claim will affect all of the lawyers who practice in your State, because each of them will have to do or not do whatever that malpractice ruling was because that's what the State is going to -- State courts will follow in the future. So it will change those lawyers' behaviors in Federal court. They are going to present an expert all of the time when they don't need to. But you can think of an example where -- not perhaps on the facts of this case, but where a State court's ruling could in fact establish a code of behavior that's not just belts and suspenders, that's something else. ",so do that mean that if the claim in the malpractice action be that the pto act unconstitutionally assume that set of fact how do that change your analysis so go back to you we be go through a list of question and i posit let us assume that the malpractice claim do involve a constitutional question then what other factor how about fraud on a claim of fraud on that the malpractice be fraud on the pto lawyer lose that it be be litigate be not it res judicata and will not it affect the patent or might it not affect the patent in a patent action i find that somewhat hard to follow let us assume in adjudicate a medical a malpractice claim the state court find that the attorney suppress information it be a finding of fact he have this information in his or her file and they do not disclose it I be not quite sure how the pto ignore that litigation or the district court do if it get to review that in a late action I be only raise this question to address justice scalia s point you be ask for an absolute rule and i posit a situation where i think it be not so clear that a state court find might not have an effect so do we have to go to your absolute rule then immigration law do not get in the weed take immigration law so patent law case of malpractice be small in number than copyright case immigration and other exclusive jurisdiction so that be okay to remove but those others be not do that make a whole lot of sense well how about a different one the one that be be propose by your adversary which be define substantial as to how it affect federal law which i think be the bottom line or the development of federal law the bottom line of grable and she say you dispute this in your brief that it do not affect the invalidated patent that there be no way that a judgment on the malpractice be go to be use in a continuation patent dispute because it be not one of the list preclusive court so how do a ruling affect patent law why be who be go to follow it besides the party how else do it affect the development of patent law who else be go to follow this malpractice determination so what you be argue they be go to make a mistake and because we might not accept certiorari that be bind on everybody else in the state I be sorry how do it the patent s invalid the patent s invalid nothing the court do here be go to change that invalidity that be what i do not understand he be not go to get his patent back from this action he be go to get money for lose it maybe so how do it affect the patent we be back to that issue okay could you answer the one point your adversary raise that give me pause a lot of pause he say a ruling on patent law of how you should or should not behave in a state malpractice claim will affect all of the lawyer who practice in your state because each of them will have to do or not do whatever that malpractice ruling be because that be what the state be go to state court will follow in the future so it will change those lawyer behavior in federal court they be go to present an expert all of the time when they do not need to but you can think of an example where not perhaps on the fact of this case but where a state court s ruling could in fact establish a code of behavior that be not just belt and suspender that be something else ,255.07,Roberts Court,"Jan 16, 2013","Jerry Gunn, et al.",Vernon Minton,11-1118,"Oct 5, 2012","Feb 20, 2013",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2012,Missouri v. McNeely,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"How come it took so long for this State to figure out that it needed to do this without a warrant? The officer testified that he's been making drunk driving arrests for years-- --and I think in only one circumstance did he need to do it without a warrant. So what made the need here eminently the sense of impractical to get the warrant? No, I understand why he decided to do it, to forego getting a warrant. Isn't his testimony dispositive of this case? He had time to get it. But it took a considerable amount of time for all the years he did it. And -- and he didn't testify to it causing a loss of any particular case. What constitutional right exists for a State to get the best evidence? No, no, no. You, the State, want to strive for that. But what in the Fourth Amendment contemplates that that's a right the State must have, that is has to get the very best evidence it can? So how can it be reasonable to forego the Fourth Amendment in a procedure as intrusive as a needle going into someone's body? I say this because breathalyzers in my mind have a much different intrusion level. They don't intrude into your body. And I think almost all jurisdictions use breathalyzers instead of blood tests. A small fraction that actually use blood tests. The ruling by us today is going to change that and is going to -- if in your favor is going to change that and is going to -- if in your favor, is going to change that and put sort of a print, the Court's print, on: Use the most intrusive way you can to prove your case. So the new rule is we have to strengthen -- the Fourth Amendment is going to be suspended whenever the prosecution can't get the best evidence to make its case out? So do you define reasonableness-- --So would the importance of the search warrant suggest, as a constitutional right, suggest that we should judge reasonableness by the people who are the least efficient or by the people who are the most reasonably efficient? Meaning people, police jurisdictions. Absolutely, but should they -- should we permit them to vary in terms of inefficiency or should we be encouraging them to vary within a reasonable range? But there are so many situations in which we require a warrant, nevertheless. When there is drug dealing in a house, every time people enter that house, it's almost a certainty that they're going to use the drugs and that evidence is going to disappear. You rely on hope -- on knowing that there's likely to be telltale signs left over. And that's the same thing you do in an alcohol situation. You rely on the testimony of the police officer, you rely on the implied consent presumption. It's not as if this is destruction of all evidence, and not like a fleeing situation where someone gets away, you have nothing left. This is -- this is vastly different. So is it okay -- is it okay to let police officers take the blood? Oh, I bet that if we rule in your favor, we will. Do you want to be in those rural places and be stopped without an independent magistrate approving a field officer taking blood from you? Mr. Shapiro, could you tell me, and what I am deeply troubled about in your argument, is you incant the totality of the circumstances test. But what circumstances is the Court actually looking at to determine whether forgoing the warrant was necessary or not under that circumstance? We know one. We know where a fatality has occurred or a serious accident, because we -- presumably you have to secure the scene and you have to take care of injured people or have cars towed, whatever else it is. But I'm not sure what other circumstances under your theory would really justify a magistrate -- a court below saying, you -- you know, it's okay, you can get a warrant here. It can't be merely because it takes too long to get the warrant because that shows inefficiency. It was part of my question earlier. Mr. Shapiro, could you go back to what in this conversation we sort of have lost focus of, which is the question presented, and which is the essence, I think, of your adversary's arguments. I'm not sure you've really put forth -- the essence of their argument is that you can forego the warrants requirement when you know for a fact that evidence is going to dissipate over time. Basically, they're saying this process undermines our right to get a warrant, because the evidence is dissipating. We certainly have cases that talk about destruction of evidence being a reason to forego the warrant. What makes this case different from those? Sure. ",how come it take so long for this state to figure out that it need to do this without a warrant the officer testify that he be be make drunk driving arrest for year and i think in only one circumstance do he need to do it without a warrant so what make the need here eminently the sense of impractical to get the warrant no i understand why he decide to do it to forego get a warrant be not his testimony dispositive of this case he have time to get it but it take a considerable amount of time for all the year he do it and and he do not testify to it cause a loss of any particular case what constitutional right exists for a state to get the best evidence no no no you the state want to strive for that but what in the fourth amendment contemplates that that be a right the state must have that be have to get the very best evidence it can so how can it be reasonable to forego the fourth amendment in a procedure as intrusive as a needle go into someone s body i say this because breathalyzer in my mind have a much different intrusion level they do not intrude into your body and i think almost all jurisdiction use breathalyzer instead of blood test a small fraction that actually use blood test the ruling by us today be go to change that and be go to if in your favor be go to change that and be go to if in your favor be go to change that and put sort of a print the court s print on use the most intrusive way you can to prove your case so the new rule be we have to strengthen the fourth amendment be go to be suspend whenever the prosecution can not get the best evidence to make its case out so do you define reasonableness so would the importance of the search warrant suggest as a constitutional right suggest that we should judge reasonableness by the people who be the least efficient or by the people who be the most reasonably efficient mean people police jurisdiction absolutely but should they should we permit them to vary in term of inefficiency or should we be encourage them to vary within a reasonable range but there be so many situation in which we require a warrant nevertheless when there be drug deal in a house every time people enter that house it be almost a certainty that they be go to use the drug and that evidence be go to disappear you rely on hope on know that there be likely to be telltale sign leave over and that be the same thing you do in an alcohol situation you rely on the testimony of the police officer you rely on the implied consent presumption it be not as if this be destruction of all evidence and not like a fleeing situation where someone get away you have nothing leave this be this be vastly different so be it okay be it okay to let police officer take the blood oh i bet that if we rule in your favor we will do you want to be in those rural place and be stop without an independent magistrate approve a field officer take blood from you mr shapiro could you tell me and what i be deeply troubled about in your argument be you incant the totality of the circumstance test but what circumstance be the court actually look at to determine whether forgo the warrant be necessary or not under that circumstance we know one we know where a fatality have occur or a serious accident because we presumably you have to secure the scene and you have to take care of injured people or have car tow whatever else it be but I be not sure what other circumstance under your theory would really justify a magistrate a court below say you you know it be okay you can get a warrant here it can not be merely because it take too long to get the warrant because that show inefficiency it be part of my question earlier mr shapiro could you go back to what in this conversation we sort of have lose focus of which be the question present and which be the essence i think of your adversary s argument I be not sure you have really put forth the essence of their argument be that you can forego the warrant requirement when you know for a fact that evidence be go to dissipate over time basically they be say this process undermine our right to get a warrant because the evidence be dissipate we certainly have case that talk about destruction of evidence be a reason to forego the warrant what make this case different from those sure ,348.31999999999994,Roberts Court,"Jan 9, 2013",Missouri,Tyler G.

So why does your lien have priority to the attorney's lien that is normally created at the commencement of the litigation? Why is the attorney bound by the agreement you signed with the beneficiary? Counsel, are you conceding-- --the plan doesn't say it? I'm sorry, the phrase that you just read says that the benefits are the same. It doesn't say that the reimbursement and subrogation language are the same. So go back to Justice Ginsburg's question, and point out in the plan what words you're relying upon. Not the summary, but the plan. I thought it took most of the litigation for the plan to be provided. In this case, he wrote -- the attorney wrote to you any number of times, and finally said, look, unless you come and tell me what your position is, I'm going to go forward. So what are attorneys supposed to do in those situations, just drop the lawsuit? Rejected it because it had nothing to do with the agreement, but it didn't reject them as a factual matter, that you were contacted. Counsel, were they supposed to -- if the insurance limit was $100,000, are you suggesting that that was a bad faith settlement? We-- --Or not to enforce it. Meaning the equity is to enforce it or to stay your hand. And so the Court could decide not to reach into the pocket of the plan participant to pay back money that the lawyer has. So what -- what's the difference between the two? Meaning, I take your argument to be that the Court was right before that freestanding subrogation claims have one set of remedies or rights, and subrogation, by agreement, have another. So what do you see as the differences between the two? So was the Court in an exercise of futility in writing what it did in Sereboff? Counsel, I understand the argument. It's a bit unsettling that you've got two kinds of rights, one implied and one express, and there's no difference between the two? You -- you've got to give them a little bit more body to have a persuasive argument. Isn't there another line after that, that says something-- Put on the back of someone else, meaning-- --I may or may not agree that in terms of your split with the participant, the contract might control. But I still am having trouble with understanding how you can bind a third party like a lawyer, who's done the effort to recover that fund -- more along Justice Breyer's question, which is, not only in -- in all equity, lawyers are entitled, whether by contract or by unjust enrichment principles, to a -- to a percentage of their expenses in recovering something. Counsel, I'm assuming, because ERISA's in place now, that the many State laws that prohibit this kind of agreement where insurance plans are seeking full reimbursement despite an attorney's efforts, that those are void, that those would be enforceable. --the only one who can fix this problem now is Congress, if they-- --perceive it as a problem.

2012,Vance v. Ball State University,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, may I interrupt a moment on-- --following up on an issue raised in part by the Chief and by Justice Ginsburg. Assuming that Davis was a direct supervisor, would there be an affirmative defense available to the employer? That would be your position? That this could not be grounds that someone who directs an employee's day-to-day activity should be treated like someone who hasn't actually undertaken the threat because the situations are different. Is that what this fight is about? What if we were to say that the EEOC's test governed or the Second Circuit test governed, but because of the nature of the difference between formal supervisors who take tangible work activities and informal supervisors who the employer would have less control over and less knowledge about their activities, that we would require an employee to complain. Would that be a crazy rule, and why? Would require, would permit the affirmative defense to be raised by an employer. No, but there is a difference between those supervisors who take direct activity, tangible direct actions, who are in power to do that, and supervisors who don't have that power, because supervisors who don't have that power are supervised -- their actions are supervised in a way that non-tangible employment supervisors are not. No, it's whether, whether or not this whole fight is over that issue. No, because it's also about the burden of proof. So if we keep the burden of proof with respect to the employer raising the affirmative defense, does that solve half your problem? Would you tell me what you see as the major difference between the EEOC and the Second Circuit rule, and why one is compelled over the other? It's the regulatory agency charged with oversight of -- of the implementation of the statute. Why shouldn't we give deference to it on-- --the standard it sets forth? Do we have a developed record enough to do that in this case? Do -- do we have a developed record enough? Petitioner's counsel says we don't, that the Seventh Circuit test didn't permit them to develop the record sufficiently to clarify all of these issues. We certainly have snippets or -- or lack snippets, as the case may be. But is the record sufficiently developed for the Court to even pronounce -- make pronouncements of that nature? Mr. Garre, there is one BSU internal document that -- a note to the file by a compliance officer, who apparently investigated one of the complaints, that says that -- Kimes is recorded as saying -- he's the avowed supervisor -- that he, quote, ""knows Davis has given direction to Vance, and that he just doesn't know what else to do.

2012,McQuiggin v. Perkins,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"That -- that's not quite what he's saying. We've had a miscarriage of justice exception for as long as there's been a habeas statute. We've applied it repeatedly. It's not that it trumps it, but that it puts into doubt the evidence you're claiming. Proves your actual innocence. It's not the sort of situation where as reasonable -- as due diligence will do, which is to override even an actually innocent person. What he says is it -- it really puts into question the validity of your claim. Where does that leave us? Let's assume-- --It's sort of an advisory opinion in your judgment. Sure, it would be, because you're telling us that there is no proof of actual innocence. So why don't we just say that? It might be its holding, but, as Justice Alito just proved, there's no basis for it because they didn't grant a COA on the substantive merits question. With respect to successive petitions. You don't see a difference-- --I'm sorry. I don't understand. I mean, there is a presumption that's been longstanding that at least with respect to the filing of your first petition, that it is a statute of limitations subject to exceptions, including the manifest injustice one. If -- it would seem to me that if they intended not to have that apply, they would have done what they did with the successive petition, but they chose not to. I'm not talking about that presumption. I'm talking about-- --our cause and effect and manifest injustice. Do you have any idea how many actual-innocence claims win on the underlying constitutional issue? How many wins on the attempt? Not many. Why -- why is it that the meritorious claim is going to be the one that's going to be hidden? Meaning-- --But you would -- you want to keep it out altogether. You want an actually -- potentially actually innocent person not to have-- --But they don't have the Federal system-- --as the first habeas.

So he's asking you, I think, to tell us how to write it. So do we write it by saying there's no diligence requirement, but there is a sort of common law laches, although that's a hard argument to make because it was based on 9(A) until recently.

2012,Florida v. Jardines,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"So doesn't that mean that what's in your home that's not visible to the public has an expectation of privacy as well? But that -- that is circular. Then why do you need a search warrant? If you have no expectation of privacy in the contraband, why bother even with a search warrant? Why is that an implied consent? That's a huge assumption. At least in the cities that I've lived in, you have to have a dog on a leash. And you don't give implied consent. If you're allergic to animals, you don't want dogs walking around at your door. No, no, no. But tell me why that you presume that there's implied consent? Do you think homeowners freely let dogs just come into their apartment? I mean, there might be some homes that do. So we're going to treat it like a human being now? You're invited to knock on my door because you're a dog? So now we tell-- --all the drug dealers, put up a sign that says “ No dogs ”. Isn't it fair just to assume that -- what's logical? I -- I let people knock on my door because they have to say something to me. I don't let a dog come up to my door -- I don't willy-nilly invite it to come up to my door. That implied consent, does that include them coming up and -- up to your porch and sweeping stuff into a garbage pan? Mr. Garre, there's no dispute that dogs can smell what human beings can't; is that correct? It's not that we can find a machine to put it on a human being to enhance their sense of smells; dogs can do something human beings can't. So you have to treat him like a guy, to think that he is not like technology in terms of augmenting what a human being can do. He's not augmenting what a human being can do. He's substituting what a human being can do. Could we go back to the concession that was asked of you, what you conceded in the Florida court or didn't? Have you conceded that the police officer sans dog, if he had come up to the door and knocked, that that would have been permissible, that that was not a search or seizure? Did he have -- did he have a right under the facts of this case? He had been told that in this house they were growing marijuana by a confidential informant. Assume that's all that he had. Would he have had a right to walk up to the door, knock on it, and start asking questions? Let's -- sans dog, yes. All right. So you are conceding that he had license to walk onto -- or walk to the door and ask questions. I guess the bottom line is that are you taking -- it sounds to me like you're saying there's no implied consent to bring a dog on to my property. You're -- Mr. Garre said differently, that there is an implied consent for your neighbor to bring the dog up for anyone else but a police officer. Is that what you're saying? There's an implied consent for anyone else or there is no implied consent, period? You're on a really slippery slope with that answer. There's dual motives in everything police officers do. They knock to hope the person comes to the door and that they can see something from the door. They knock -- they always have a dual motive. So you're suggesting what. In terms of our rule-- --He knocks, and he says to the neighbor, who are you? I've gotten a report, and I'm smelling drugs, so I know you have drugs in there. But if he smells first and asks the question second, that's not okay? I thought what the dog does, according to the police officer's testimony, is he gave him a long leash so the dog would lead him to the drugs. And what the dog did, I thought, according to what I read, was go past the motorcycle to make sure -- I mean, the officer said this -- you don't know if the drugs are in the motorcycle, you don't know if they're in the garage, you don't know where they might be. So the dog is permitted to roam around until he catches the scent. Is that accurate? But the point is that he's sniffing all the way around the scene. Yes.

2012,Millbrook v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, you've argued something slightly different than I took from your briefs. Earlier, in response I think to Justice Ginsburg, you were queueing closer to the Solicitor General's position that this has to be limited in some way. And you said you'll let them establish the boundaries. I don't want to let them establish the boundaries. I want you to tell me, is it criminal law enforcement agents, is it law enforcement agents with -- acting -- as the Ninth Circuit says -- acting within a law enforcement activity? Because I am finding it hard to figure out why we shouldn't permit tort liability on an OSHA inspector, who, in inspecting whatever he or she is inspecting punches someone or does some intentional assaultive act, why they should be permitted to do that. Assuming it falls within the definition of a law enforcement activity. I think they're saying is arrests, search and seizure, and whatever the third was. But let's define it more broadly. Let's assume I was willing to define it to include all of the activities that a law enforcement agent would engage in, including protective services, security services, like your officers. Let's assume that we've defined it more broadly. What's the problem with their position? And of -- yes, with amicus's or the government's, meaning, instead of limiting it to criminal activity, limited to law enforcement activities broadly defined. Could you go back and tell me, yet again -- you give a limiting principle, but I'm not sure how it applies. You seem to be saying -- do you agree with your -- with the Petitioner that law enforcement officer includes correction officers? And why? Because they have all of those other powers, so how is that different from those in the civil area who have similar powers to arrest, search and seize, to-- --How about Customs agents? My problem is park employees I think of as officers when you meet them at the parks. They are guarding the parks. Or they may also be giving tours. They are usually doing sort of a mixture of-- --duties. Let's assume we adopted the definition Justice Scalia just proposed, law enforcement officer engaged in law enforcement activities. Would correction officers be engaged in law enforcement activities? Well, you can look at it both ways. Are correction officers as officers who are protecting or securing prisoners, are they acting in a law enforcement capacity in your -- forget about what act, what tort they commit, but do they function-- --Okay. I'm sorry. What -- what is it about a corrections officer other than the act that was committed here, which was an alleged sexual act which nobody could, except by some definition of State law, think that that ever happens naturally in the course. But that's an intentional assault. The very definition of the crimes that are covered assumes that it's not an act that's licensed. So, why isn't the correction officer acting in a law enforcement capacity when he's restraining people and securing them? Well, what happens -- what happens in the police precinct when police officers are holding pretrial detainees? Are they acting as police officers or as security people? Or even when a prisoner comes back to court for a court appearance and there are U.S. marshals who guard them rather than correction officers, what are they serving as in your mind? One other advantage of your definition is that it takes us out of workplace fights between two employees, because presumably the officers who punch each other out, if that incident occurs, aren't acting in a law enforcement capacity. I am assuming that is part of your argument as well. All right. Then it goes back to the question I asked one of your adversaries, which is all of this depends on how broadly or narrowly we define law enforcement activities. If we take it as broadly as the Government is suggesting, at moments, it would -- we could very well say, you are right, it's a law enforcement activity, but not as narrowly as some would have it be. It would include securing or detaining people, or securing or detaining people. And it would include the Park Service person who stops a visitor and punches them out. It would include the military personnel who stops someone and does an intentional tort against them, even though they may just be walking on the grounds rather than serving as security that particular day. So the point is, why should we give it the narrow reading you are giving, and not the broader reading the Government seems to be suggesting? What's the difference between the officer who punches the prisoner to get him on the ground and pick him up? Would it apply to the officer who files an arrest complaint against the prisoner, and not to the security officer who just merely carries him back to his cell? Or does some physical injury that's substantial. So the intentional assault gets treated as an exception to this only when the security officer actually files an arrest complaint? Or would it at all? Yes. ",counsel you have argue something slightly different than i take from your brief earlier in response i think to justice ginsburg you we be queue closer to the solicitor general s position that this have to be limit in some way and you say you will let them establish the boundary i do not want to let them establish the boundary i want you to tell me be it criminal law enforcement agent be it law enforcement agent with act as the ninth circuit say act within a law enforcement activity because i be find it hard to figure out why we should not permit tort liability on an osha inspector who in inspect whatever he or she be inspect punch someone or do some intentional assaultive act why they should be permit to do that assume it fall within the definition of a law enforcement activity i think they be say be arrest search and seizure and whatever the third be but let us define it more broadly let us assume i be willing to define it to include all of the activity that a law enforcement agent would engage in include protective service security service like your officer let us assume that we have define it more broadly what be the problem with their position and of yes with amicus s or the government s meaning instead of limit it to criminal activity limit to law enforcement activity broadly define could you go back and tell me yet again you give a limiting principle but I be not sure how it apply you seem to be say do you agree with your with the petitioner that law enforcement officer include correction officer and why because they have all of those other power so how be that different from those in the civil area who have similar power to arrest search and seize to how about custom agent my problem be park employee i think of as officer when you meet them at the park they be guard the park or they may also be give tour they be usually do sort of a mixture of duty let us assume we adopt the definition justice scalia just propose law enforcement officer engage in law enforcement activity would correction officer be engage in law enforcement activity well you can look at it both way be correction officer as officer who be protect or secure prisoner be they act in a law enforcement capacity in your forget about what act what tort they commit but do they function okay I be sorry what what be it about a correction officer other than the act that be commit here which be an allege sexual act which nobody could except by some definition of state law think that that ever happen naturally in the course but that be an intentional assault the very definition of the crime that be cover assumes that it be not an act that be license so why be not the correction officer act in a law enforcement capacity when he be restrain people and secure them well what happen what happen in the police precinct when police officer be hold pretrial detainee be they act as police officer or as security people or even when a prisoner come back to court for a court appearance and there be us marshal who guard them rather than correction officer what be they serve as in your mind one other advantage of your definition be that it take us out of workplace fight between two employee because presumably the officer who punch each other out if that incident occur be not act in a law enforcement capacity i be assume that be part of your argument as well all right then it go back to the question i ask one of your adversary which be all of this depend on how broadly or narrowly we define law enforcement activity if we take it as broadly as the government be suggest at moment it would we could very well say you be right it be a law enforcement activity but not as narrowly as some would have it be it would include secure or detain people or secure or detain people and it would include the park service person who stop a visitor and punch them out it would include the military personnel who stop someone and do an intentional tort against them even though they may just be walk on the ground rather than serve as security that particular day so the point be why should we give it the narrow reading you be give and not the broad read the government seem to be suggest what be the difference between the officer who punch the prisoner to get him on the ground and pick him up would it apply to the officer who file an arrest complaint against the prisoner and not to the security officer who just merely carry him back to his cell or do some physical injury that be substantial so the intentional assault get treat as an exception to this only when the security officer actually file an arrest complaint or would it at all yes ,359.28,Roberts Court,"Feb 19, 2013",Kim Millbrook,United States,11-10362,"Sep 25, 2012","Mar 27, 2013",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

I mean, without looking at the individual facts of the case, the 30 percent is going to be underinclusive in some circumstances, overinclusive in others. So how do you deal with our holding that you are not entitled to the overinclusive portion? Life is never certain, and so I don't even go to that issue. I go just simply to the question, how can you, ex ante, predict -- particularly with a statute that wasn't based on any empirical data -- that 30 percent normally is the right amount? You just picked it out of the air? You could pick 40, 50, 60. How do we draw the line? Now, how does it have the right to announce that in a FELA case or in a Jones Act case where those injured parties, they have a property right in their protection but this statute applies to that recovery as well? So they can deny a litigant a property right in that recovery? I don't know how you can go in and ask for something you don't own.

I've never heard of such a thing, how they would have standing to sue on your behalf if they have no property interest in the recovery. How do you sue for something you have no property interest in? So go back to Justice Scalia's question. There has to be some interest in the 30 percent by the plaintiff. Could I just clarify one point? Does this rule preclude parties, as we said in Ahlborn, from stipulating to a settlement at all? Your brief is not clear on that. They can still stipulate. It's only if after the stipulation, it hasn't been allocated that you can recover? So what you're basically now saying is that there can never be a stipulation. You're saying that the parties cannot enter into a stipulation. I didn't hear Justice Ginsburg's question. Basically you are saying the judge would be required to give you your one-third regardless of what the jury said. So all those States that have jury verdicts, special verdicts that require a certain amount, they could avoid that by just simply passing this law and avoid the anti-lien statute that way? 16 States already have something close to a presumption of a percentage. Do you have any evidence that in those 16 States where it's only a presumption and not a fixed amount, that they are falling apart because of it? In the absence of this statute, what did your State do beforehand? Am I correct that what you believe and what the courts have been doing in your State, the lower courts, is that they won't approve a settlement that doesn't have the one-third, and they won't enter a judgment that doesn't have the one-third? Is that correct? So I'm right. They just won't accept the private stipulation that doesn't do that, and they won't enter into a judgment that doesn't do that, correct? Just answer my question. All right. Going back to Justice Alito's. The jury says it's less or more or whatever of -- of the settlement as medical expenses, it doesn't matter what they say, the court can't enter a judgment for that amount, they have to enter a judgment for either the one-third or the full medical expenses. And that's what they have been doing. I know that was argued before. But I read Ahlborn very carefully, and I don't see it. I read the amici briefs that reference different procedures, and not one of them referenced the North Carolina procedure. So, I know that was argued before. You didn't argue it in your brief here, and I assume you didn't because you did what I did, which was to read Ahlborn carefully and read what it cited, and I don't see it cited. I don't see the North Carolina procedure referenced in Ahlborn as something that States could do. It wasn't referenced directly in the -- in the opinion, and it wasn't referenced indirectly by the amici. The amici were talking about substantially different procedures. But my point is, Justice Kennedy's question was that somehow in that opinion, we approved the North Carolina system. Is there a direct reference to North Carolina's system-- --in that or in any of the amici brief that talked about different State rules? 16 are doing it already. Is that because they know they are going to be subject to a hearing if they don't reach an agreement? So there is an inducement for them to do what this State didn't do. When told to come in, they ignored it. In those States, States know they are going to increase potentially their costs, so they come in more often. Counsel, do judges do this in non-Medicaid cases regularly? Let's deal with what appears to be many of my colleagues' gut instinct, okay? This is -- it costs too much, it's too burdensome. We've already answered why not, but in the end, they don't believe you could ever figure out the number. That's really their bottom line, that this number's artificial no matter what you do, so you might as well just throw a label on it, reasonable or not, and leave it alone. How do you answer that argument, because that's the essence of their -- of their belief-- --that this bottom line allocation is always going to be wrong somehow. Counsel, in those proceedings, are witnesses called or is it usually done on papers? Could you move the microphone so it's a little closer to you? Thank you. Ms. Anders, could you please finish your response, when you said various States do various things. Could you describe some of them? How many States have North Carolina's rule? Do you know? So how do -- what do we do with the Federal statute that says, You are not entitled to a lien of any amount that is greater than your medical expenses? And using the Solicitor General's Office example, everybody knows that the true value of medical expenses in a particular case was only 10 percent, you are still getting 30 percent. How do we -- how do we honor the terms of the Federal statute? ",how do you know that ex ante how could you ever know that ex ante i mean without look at the individual fact of the case the percent be go to be underinclusive in some circumstance overinclusive in others so how do you deal with our hold that you be not entitle to the overinclusive portion life be never certain and so i do not even go to that issue i go just simply to the question how can you ex ante predict particularly with a statute that be not base on any empirical data that percent normally be the right amount you just pick it out of the air you could pick how do we draw the line now how do it have the right to announce that in a fela case or in a jones act case where those injured party they have a property right in their protection but this statute applies to that recovery as well so they can deny a litigant a property right in that recovery i do not know how you can go in and ask for something you do not own i do not know how the plaintiff can go in and litigate a case if they do not have a property interest that they can then assign to someone else I have never hear of such a thing how they would have stand to sue on your behalf if they have no property interest in the recovery how do you sue for something you have no property interest in so go back to justice scalia s question there have to be some interest in the percent by the plaintiff could i just clarify one point do this rule preclude party as we say in ahlborn from stipulate to a settlement at all your brief be not clear on that they can still stipulate it be only if after the stipulation it have not be allocate that you can recover so what you be basically now say be that there can never be a stipulation you be say that the party can not enter into a stipulation i do not hear justice ginsburg s question basically you be say the judge would be require to give you your one third regardless of what the jury say so all those state that have jury verdict special verdict that require a certain amount they could avoid that by just simply pass this law and avoid the anti lien statute that way state already have something close to a presumption of a percentage do you have any evidence that in those state where it be only a presumption and not a fixed amount that they be fall apart because of it in the absence of this statute what do your state do beforehand be i correct that what you believe and what the court have be do in your state the low court be that they will not approve a settlement that do not have the one third and they will not enter a judgment that do not have the one third be that correct so I be right they just will not accept the private stipulation that do not do that and they will not enter into a judgment that do not do that correct just answer my question all right go back to justice alito s the jury say it be less or more or whatever of of the settlement as medical expense it do not matter what they say the court can not enter a judgment for that amount they have to enter a judgment for either the one third or the full medical expense and that be what they have be do i know that be argue before but i read ahlborn very carefully and i do not see it i read the amici brief that reference different procedure and not one of them reference the north carolina procedure so i know that be argue before you do not argue it in your brief here and i assume you do not because you do what i do which be to read ahlborn carefully and read what it cite and i do not see it cite i do not see the north carolina procedure reference in ahlborn as something that state could do it be not reference directly in the in the opinion and it be not reference indirectly by the amici the amici we be talk about substantially different procedure but my point be justice kennedy s question be that somehow in that opinion we approve the north carolina system be there a direct reference to north carolina s system in that or in any of the amici brief that talk about different state rule be do it already be that because they know they be go to be subject to a hearing if they do not reach an agreement so there be an inducement for them to do what this state do not do when tell to come in they ignore it in those state state know they be go to increase potentially their cost so they come in more often counsel do judge do this in non medicaid case regularly let us deal with what appear to be many of my colleague gut instinct okay this be it cost too much it be too burdensome we have already answer why not but in the end they do not believe you could ever figure out the number that be really their bottom line that this number s artificial no matter what you do so you might as well just throw a label on it reasonable or not and leave it alone how do you answer that argument because that be the essence of their of their belief that this bottom line allocation be always go to be wrong somehow counsel in those proceeding be witness call or be it usually do on paper could you move the microphone so it be a little close to you thank you ms anders could you please finish your response when you say various state do various thing could you describe some of them how many state have north carolina s rule do you know so how do what do we do with the federal statute that say you be not entitle to a lien of any amount that be great than your medical expense and use the solicitor general s office example everybody know that the true value of medical expense in a particular case be only percent you be still get percent how do we how do we honor the

2012,Ryan v. Gonzales,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"So tell me how you define indefinite stays, meaning are you okay with the six months to a year stay for a court to try to get someone back to competence, assuming that there is a claim in which the defendant's information is necessary? So how do you deal with Justice Kagan's earlier question of what difference does it make if the person's still necessary -- or the information, potential information is still necessary, what makes it unnecessary after a year? But those cases didn't establish a limit on how long states needed to take to adjudicate claims. They just said a district court should put in conditions that move things along-- --that require defendants to press their claims within a reasonable time that required periodic updates, that required monitoring by the court, but it didn't set an artificial end time. It just said you can't just do an open-ended stay and not give conditions to comply with. Why should this be treated differently? But you cap it by saying as long as the discretion is not exercised for more than a year. Would that standard have been met in both of these cases? Meaning, Carter's claim -- and the one that concerns me the most is why he was excluded from trial, and what if he did or did not do with his attorneys afterwards. And Gonzales is a slightly different case. But would your position be that in both cases there was enough? No, no, no. My question was, on the facts of both of these cases, was there a basis for granting the stay with respect to-- --their conditions? Neither Carter or Gonzales? Well, that is that you're -- that seems like almost a due process argument, that in every single case you have to grant a stay. You're -- you're parting from the Respondent in Carter, and you are making a broader argument. No incompetent client, presumably, can help you make those decisions. So tell me, are you saying that in every single case, the client is entitled to a stay? So why does that situation give you an entitlement if it's not in every single case? What in the record could plausibly, certainly be seen that would suggest that your defendant has information that could be valuable? Assume it's not the ABA standard, but the plausibility standard or the certainty standard or something. Well, that you can see from the record. What would plausibly give rise to a belief that there was some ex parte exchange between the judge and the defendant? Is there anything to suggest that in the record? Do you have anything to suggest that there had been an ex parte exchange that would account for that snarling? Counsel, in this case, the district court denied a stay. If this is an equitable power, how can you be comfortable that the Ninth Circuit as an appellate court overrode the district court's equitable discretion? But you're not claiming that that issue is always in the district court's hands to start with. So please identify for me what -- how we establish or set a standard so that appellate courts are not overriding that at whim? Oh, you're flipping it. You're saying first you give a stay for competence. You've determined competency first and not essentiality first? The million dollar question: Assume we say you have to spend a reasonable time trying to get someone to competency. And, here, there appears to have been efforts to do so. And your client is saying, I can't be treated because the drugs make me sick. So when does all of this end? Well, that time has passed by now, hasn't it? That that -- they stopped treating him? No one's continuing to monitor him or trying to treat him? I'm a little confused as to-- I think the Ninth Circuit remanded so that treatment could be had. So why has it stopped? Am I -- am I understanding that your position in response to the question from Justice Scalia and Justice Kennedy is that for you, indefinite is any stay whatsoever? It sounds like what you are proposing, or in response to them, is that no stay for purposes of determining competence, whether it's short or long, is permissible. Is that your argument? I could take objection to that characterization, because the clerk of the Court told the Court that neither party was happy with what was happening, and the Court still entered the order. But let me go back to my question a moment. Amici say that most competency issues are resolved within months and that many individuals, the vast majority, are restored to competency with proper medication within months. Are you opposing those kinds of stays? But under your definition, it's never appropriate, really. You argue -- you argue two things. You say, under Pinholster, courts always have to rely on the record. Even though a doctor says, it can be done, we have to try? Well, they can never say, it can be done. They can say-- --we have to try. That's also -- I'm not sure how they can do that until they try. Petitioner says they won't because they can come back with new evidence after habeas is closed. Why is that inadequate? I'm presume -- I presume that the one claim among your many -- yours is the defendant who was excluded from trial, correct? So that if he comes back and says, I told my attorneys I would behave, and I wanted to come back earlier, but they never let me back in, this would not be a new claim, this would be part of the old claim that has been adjudicated, correct? But without his information. Well, that you could see from the record. The question in my mind would be whether he told counsel he would behave and counsel ignored that information, correct? Could you tell me what the value is to wait for the Ford analysis or the Ford examination to the time of execution? Putting that aside. “ At all costs ” is what you seem to be saying. Well, your adversary has not said it's total speculation. He suggests that if we set a standard that requires -- we can talk about what the terms are: suggestive in the record, plausible in the record, typical sort of situation -- but assuming that there is some basis to believe that the defendant can provide information of importance to the claim, why should that be -- that door be shut? And how do you deal with his answer that if the claim is not a new claim, but just new information about an old claim, that he will be barred from a successive petition? ",so tell me how you define indefinite stay mean be you okay with the six month to a year stay for a court to try to get someone back to competence assume that there be a claim in which the defendant s information be necessary so how do you deal with justice kagan s early question of what difference do it make if the person s still necessary or the information potential information be still

2012,Bullock v. BankChampaign,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Their preference is that they wanted a piece of the action. They still do. They want the profits from that investment. Whether they're entitled to it is a different issue, but-- --My problem is the following, which is let's assume he had taken the money and lost it and he never repaid it. What does it matter whether he thought he could take the money or not? I thought the very basic definition of defalcation in every dictionary at the time and forever, one of the three definitions has always been that you cause a loss to the -- to the trust. Why does mental state matter at all, is my bottom line? I think that your stronger argument is that loss to the estate, or the one that you have to -- can direct your attention to, is what is the loss to the trust? But what does it matter whether I intended to lose it or not if I wasn't entitled to lose it? Well, that's Justice Breyer's point, which is if you took the money and lost it, what does it matter? You took it. Unless -- unless you were drugged and didn't know that you were taking the money and somebody else forced you to in some -- under some sort of duress defense, some outrageous question -- isn't the issue the one that Justice Breyer came to? If you're a fiduciary, why should an excuse of ignorance of the law ever save you when you are required to exercise the highest protection of the trust? Why should you be discharged if you took -- if you knowingly did an act, the actus reus, with its concomitant mental state. You intended to take the money. Counsel, give me your best answer to the rule that we should write, okay? Forgetting that I don't accept that you need a mental state, okay? Let's go to just the loss issue. If I agree with you that you need to prove the loss, this is a very unusual trust, because the measure of what the trust's res should be is fixed. It was the amount of the trust plus the fixed interest, essentially. This is a very unusual trust. In the norm, the trust just says to the trustee, invest prudently. And the trustee self-deals by taking the res out, puts the investment in his or her own name and takes the profit. In that situation, how would you measure the loss? In the normal self-dealing where the trustee just has to invest prudently and is depriving the trust of that investment value, would you say in that situation that the loss is measured by the lost opportunity? Because there is a difference between what the trust loses and the gain that the trustee makes, which under normal trust principles the gain has to be disgorged. Are you separating out those two things and how are you separating them out and how would I -- how would we write, the Court write this opinion to give loss meaning? What's the -- what's the meaning you want to give it? So under your theory, the profit to the trustee is never a measurement. Assume that that is distasteful, because for all the reasons the Government argues in its amicus brief, the idea that a trustee could self-deal is the height of a breach of fiduciary duty. So give me something that -- that would win your case without upsetting the fact that defalcation somehow should, in the norm, include something as egregious as self-dealing. You don't think your guy did, because he didn't know, but let's assume the worst case. The guy knew. What does it matter -- if the money is missing, what does it matter the reason why in terms of recklessness or intent? You took the money. Justice Breyer and I both agree you intended to take the money. So why are you adopting the need for recklessness, unless you're trying to avoid the second component that the other side's talking about, which is that you caused a loss to the trust? Because that's where you have a problem here, where you have a problem, because there really is no loss to the trust in a traditional sense. Well, the problem is that, yes, there was a breach of the trust. But in terms of the terms of the trust, the trust got every penny that it would have earned if the money had not been taken. It got the trust plus the fixed 6 percent that the trust was entitled to. So it suffered no loss in its traditional sense. So are we fighting about the meaning of loss? That's really the question. Are we fighting about what loss means? But he did. This is the unusual part of this trust, which is that by the terms of this trust, it was only going to grow at principal plus a fixed interest. Most trusts are not written this way. This is the highly unusual trust, where it never -- should have made more money, because, taking the Chief Justice's hypothetical, which is he had invested it and just gotten the interest due, why would there be a defalcation? What's the loss opportunity or the loss that you would have suffered. Yes. But let's assume a different fact scenario, that he didn't make $250,000, that he happened to make just the amount of the interest required, and he paid all of that back just as he did here, what would have been the defalcation under the Chief Justice's hypothetical? I've never heard of a defalcation that didn't result in some monetary loss. What would have been the monetary loss in the Chief's hypothetical? Would you just repeat what you said? Your voice turned. That's what I understood. So you're saying that that is not the case? But there is two components of the award, the attorney's fees plus the $250,000 profit. And you're representing to me right now that as a trustee he was entitled to invest that fund for the trust? And so there was a lost opportunity here as well? Is it your position that he couldn't have invested this? Let's assume that he knew -- that he knew. As a trustee for the trust. Okay. Then you may be losing this case. Because if he could invest it for the trust, why isn't the loss -- isn't it a loss for the trust that he took this opportunity away from the trust? Let's assume he could have. Then why isn't the loss of opportunity? Let's assume his argument that he could. Then we have to go back to -- to the first issue, whether a mental state is required or not. ",their preference be that they want a piece of the action they still do they want the profit from that investment whether they be entitle to it be a different issue but my problem be the following which be let us assume he have take the money and lose it and he never repay it what do it matter whether he think he could take the money or not i think the very basic definition of defalcation in every dictionary at the time and forever one of the three definition have always be that you because a loss to the to the trust why do mental state matter at all be my bottom line i think that your strong argument be that loss to the estate or the one that you have to can direct your attention to be what be the loss to the trust but what do it matter whether i intend to lose it or not if i be not entitle to lose it well that be justice breyer s point which be if you take the money and lose it what do it matter you take it unless unless you we be drug and do not know that you we be take the money and somebody else force you to in some under some sort of duress defense some outrageous question be not the issue the one that justice breyer come to if you be a fiduciary why should an excuse of ignorance of the law ever save you when you be require to exercise the high protection of the trust why should you be discharge if you take if you knowingly do an act the actus reus with its concomitant mental state you intend to take the money counsel give me your best answer to the rule that we should write okay forget that i do not accept that you need a mental state okay let us go to just the loss issue if i agree with you that you need to prove the loss this be a very unusual trust because the measure of what the trust s re should be be fix it be the amount of the trust plus the fixed interest essentially this be a very unusual trust in the norm the trust just say to the trustee invest prudently and the trustee self deal by take the re out put the investment in his or her own

would you say in that situation that the loss be measure by the lose opportunity because there be a difference between what the trust loses and the gain that the trustee make which under normal trust principle the gain have to be disgorge be you separate out those two thing and how be you separate them out and how would i how would we write the court write this opinion to give loss meaning what be the what be the meaning you want to give it so under your theory the profit to the trustee be never a measurement assume that that be distasteful because for all the reason the government argue in its

should in the norm include something as egregious as self dealing you do not think your guy do because he do not know but let us assume the bad case the guy know what do it matter if the money be miss what do it matter the reason why in term of recklessness or intent you take the money justice breyer and i both agree you intend to take the money so why be you adopt the need for recklessness unless you be try to avoid the second component that the other side s talk about which be that you cause a loss to the trust because that be where you have a problem here where you have a problem because there really be no loss to the trust in a traditional sense well the problem be that yes there be a breach of the trust but in term of the term of the trust the trust get every penny that it would have earn if the money have not be take it get the trust plus the fixed percent that the trust be entitle to so it suffer no loss in its traditional sense so be we fight about the meaning of loss that be really the question be we fight about what loss mean but he do this be the unusual part of this trust which be that by the term of this trust it be only go to grow at principal plus a fixed interest most trust be not write this way this be the highly unusual trust where it never should have make more money because take the chief justice s hypothetical which be he have invest it and just

you be say that that be not the case but there be two component of the award the attorney s fee plus the profit and you be represent to me right now that as a trustee he be entitle to invest that fund for the trust and so there be a lost opportunity here as well be it your position that he could not have invest this let us assume that he know that he know as a trustee for the trust okay then you may be lose this case because if he could invest it for the trust why be not the loss be not it a loss for the trust that he take this opportunity away from the trust let us assume he could have then

Meaning whether there was an exaction or no exaction or whatever happened in terms of the denial, you couldn't win on your offer because the policy of the State was clear, and in my mind, unassailable. We have to preserve wetlands. Conservation of other wetlands is not enough. Mitigation means make sure that we get a net gain of wetlands. So why are we here? How do you decide whether the agency has done that right or not? How do you normally decide? Let's assume Justice Kagan's question or Justice Ginsburg's question. No -- it just says, come to us with a mitigation plan. And you say, this is what I offer and it's enough. And they say, no, it's not enough; denied. Would you go through the State administrative process to figure out whether that was arbitrary and capricious, whether it was a Penn Central violation? What would you do with that claim in the normal circumstance? Justice Kennedy's question. It would be an inverse condemnation. Which -- how does that not address going too far? You just said it. If -- if this is unrelated to the denial of your permit of all uses of your land and you're saying that's the problem, which is I still have a use, I just want more, why does that entitle you to your lost profits? When were you ever entitled to start with the claim that somehow you're entitled to a permit as a matter of law? Mr. Kneedler, can I go back to the questions presented for a moment? The court below did two separate rulings, I think. One is there can't be a taking if the -- if the claim is that it's of an undifferentiated money, not a risk. And I think you would agree with that. If the only issue is an obligation to pay money, that that's not a takings claim, correct? Right. There was a second holding, however, which really gets eclipsed by the second, which is a denial of a permit doesn't permit you to raise the Nollan-Dolan case, and it appears to me even if there is an easement situation, so even if there is an actual takings claim at issue. Do you agree with that first holding by the court below? Assuming we narrow it not to undifferentiated money, but is there a difference between a denial or a grant? What do we do with what Mr. Kneedler says is a ruling in your favor on this question, that all denials are subject to Nollan and Dolan? What do we do with that? What's the -- I see an enormous flood gate here, and one in which we are sending a signal that perhaps States should be more quiet rather than more engaging. They should just say no, because anything they offer is going to be seen as an -- potentially as an unconstitutional taking. They should just plain say no, not explain why, not engage in any work with you to mitigate. But they're not. People are asked to pay taxes. Homeowners are asked to pay taxes all the time; development fees if they want to develop something. People are subject to money exactions all of the time in this society. So what happens in just -- when the legislature passes a development fee? Are you now saying that's subject to Nollan and Dolan, too? ",counsel I have have a problem with your argument okay from the record it be very clear that a conservation offer be not consider mitigation because there be still a net loss of wetland the policy be abundantly clear state and undisputed okay so give that policy why be we even in this case mean whether there be an exaction or no exaction or whatever happen in term of the denial you could not win on your offer because the policy of the state be clear and in my mind unassailable we have to preserve wetland conservation of other wetland be not enough mitigation mean make sure that we get a net gain of wetland so why be we here how do you decide whether the agency have do that right or not how do you normally decide let us assume justice kagan s question or justice ginsburg s question no it just say come to us with a mitigation plan and you say this be what i offer and it be enough and they say no it be not enough deny would you go through the state administrative process to figure out whether that be arbitrary and capricious whether it be a penn central violation what would you do with that claim in the normal circumstance justice kennedy s question it would be an inverse condemnation which how do that not address go too far you just say it if if this be unrelated to the denial of your permit of all us of your land and you be say that be the problem which be i still have a use i just want more why do that entitle you to your lose profit when we be you ever entitle to start with the claim that somehow you be entitle to a permit as a matter of law mr kneedler can i go back to the question present for a moment the court below do two separate ruling i think one be there can not be a take if the if the claim be that it be of an undifferentiated money not a risk and i think you would agree with that if the only issue be an obligation to pay money that that be not a taking claim correct right there be a second holding however which really get eclipse by the second which be a denial of a permit do not permit you to raise the nollan dolan case and it appear to me even if there be an easement situation so even if there be an actual taking claim at issue do you agree with that first holding by the court below assume we narrow it not to undifferentiated money but be there a difference between a denial or a grant what do we do with what mr kneedler say be a ruling in your favor on this question that all denial be subject to nollan and dolan what do we do with that what be the i see an enormous flood gate here and one in which we be send a signal that perhaps state should be more quiet rather than more engaging they should just say no because anything they offer be go to be see as an potentially as an unconstitutional taking they should just plain say no not explain why not engage in any work with you to mitigate but they be not people be ask to pay tax homeowner be ask to pay tax all the time development fee if they want to develop something people be subject to money exaction all of the time in this society so what happen in just when the legislature pass a development fee be you now say that be subject to nollan and dolan too ,268.65,Roberts Court,"Jan 15, 2013",Coy Koontz,St. John's River Water Management,11-1447,"Oct 5, 2012","Jun 25, 2013",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2012,"Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Rosenkranz, can I ask you, just -- it is a practical question, but I think it has theoretical impact. A manufacturer can choose to contract or a copyright holder choose to contract with someone here to manufacture their goods. They could contract with someone abroad, anywhere in the world, directly. They can choose to license their trademark and permit a distributor abroad to manufacture under their U.S. copyright; or they can permit the licensee to register the copyright abroad and distribute. In your definition of “ lawfully made under this title ”, does “ lawfully made under this title ” apply to all of those situations, i.e.-- --I think clearly to the manufacturer who manufactures abroad-- --clearly to the manufacturer who licensed a distributor to do it for it. But does it also apply to the -- to the copyright owner who basically gives the copyright to a foreign distributor and lets the foreign distributor register it abroad? That is -- that is broader than I thought. And I'm not quite sure why you don't mean if this title applied. Because if the-- --the manufacturer who is manufacturing under the English copyright, because the distributor has an English copyright, is not manufacturing under the U.S. copyright, they are manufacturing under the English copyright. I'm sorry. Is your reading now that when the library imports in a book or a film or whatever it's importing in, it goes to the customs agent and it says to the customs agent: I don't have the express authorization of the copyright owner, but I'm a library, so I can import this book in? I'm -- I'm a person who's bought the book in England and I'm bringing it to my wife? What provision gives me the right to do that? So deal with the wife. How does the wife get her book? No, no. Is there -- what provision gives the wife a right under your reading? No, to keep for yourself. As far as I understand-- --your reading, I brought it abroad, I can't import it in. Don't those horribles-- --Why is it that a U.S. copyright owner who contracts in England to make books -- he doesn't have an English copyright, he just simply chooses that place to manufacture as opposed to the U.S. -- why is he making that copy under English law and not under his rights of U.S. copyright? But he's selling it no -- no differently than Quality King was -- or the Quality King-- --Mr. Olson, we know from the Carp exchange that the response was, this is something that we have to study with care, in 1976. The parade of horribles is now causing the Solicitor General and at least one, if not two, courts of appeals to write exceptions into the language to take care of what they perceive as horribles. Isn't it incumbent upon us to give the statute what is plainly a more rational plain meaning than to try to give it a meaning and then fix it because we understand that the meaning doesn't make sense? Could you point to something in the legislative history to support that? So you get what you wanted anyway. That's really the bottom line. We undo Quality King, except that the price is that people have to ship their manufacturing abroad.

2012,Genesis Healthcare v. Symczyk,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, so what am I to make of your transmittal letter which says, in the offer itself, that -- JA 5556, that Petitioners make clear that the offer of judgment, quote, ""was not to be construed as an admission that Petitioners are liable in this action or that respondent has suffered any damage? "" What -- what are we to make of that-- --when you're now claiming that you would have accepted a judgment of liability? How did you pick the $7,500? I see in the -- in the FLSA that it also requires an amount for liquidated damages. Did you include that amount as well? Counsel, I have-- --Counsel, can I ask a fundamental question under Rule 68? When I was a district court judge, if parties told me about their settlement discussions I would get quite upset. But, it says explicitly -- explicitly: ""Evidence of an unaccepted offer is not admissible except in a proceeding to determine costs. "" What authorizes you to use evidence of that offer to argue anything-- --especially when the statute gives the plaintiff an absolute statutory right to refuse it at a specific penalty? What permits you to use it as evidence of anything, mootness, I don't care what you're using it for, except in cost? I have a question for you, counsel. Counsel, there is -- from the beginning, you never accepted the offer. What you appear to have conceded and -- is that the amount of the offer would settle your personal claim. Mr. Katyal, I'm a little troubled that you have given up or argue that the ability to enter a forced judgment is permissible under Rule 68. There is nothing in that rule that gives the court that power, certainly not stated explicitly or even implicitly, because it talks about an entire procedure of accepting the offer or rejecting it, all of it in the hands of the parties, none of it until the entry of the judgment in the hands of the court and only after the plaintiff has accepted the offer in writing. So I can't see anything but an inherent power. So, for me, if there is an inherent power, it has to be under a default judgment because the other side is saying, “ I give up ”. All right. Let's go from there, at least with me, and that may answer an earlier question about an inquest on damages, because that is a part of the requirements for a default judgment, so that if there is a dispute about damages that can be resolved. But my point is that liability is admitted. Now let's deal with the Chief's question and Justice Scalia's question, which is in what ways is this comparable to a shared cost like what motivated our decision in class actions, that the settlement of one existing plaintiff doesn't settle the collective action. How is this similar to that? --to get the point -- the Court had to evaluate whether the offer actually met your personal damages claim, too. And what you're saying-- --in those pages is the Court didn't even do that. But what you're talking about is imputing into this process a fairness hearing, essentially, to see, by the district court, to determine whether this is a quirky case where you entered a judgment and you don't need collective action or whether or not this is a genuine case that requires joining plaintiffs. ",counsel so what be i to make of your transmittal letter which say in the offer itself that ja that petitioner make clear that the offer of judgment quote be not to be construe as an admission that petitioner be liable in this action or that respondent have suffer any damage what what be we to make of that when you be now claim that you would have accept a judgment of liability how do you pick the i see in the in the flsa that it also require an amount for liquidated damage do you include that amount as well counsel i have counsel can i ask a fundamental question under rule when i be a district court judge if party tell me about their settlement discussion i would get quite upset but it say explicitly explicitly evidence of an unaccepted offer be not admissible except in a proceeding to determine costs what authorize you to use evidence of that offer to argue anything especially when the statute give the plaintiff an absolute statutory right to refuse it at a specific penalty what permit you to use it as evidence of anything mootness i do not care what you be use it for except in cost i have a question for you counsel counsel there be from the beginning you never accept the offer what you appear to have concede and be that the amount of the offer would settle your personal claim mr katyal I be a little troubled that you have give up or argue that the ability to enter a forced judgment be permissible under rule there be nothing in that rule that give the court that power certainly not state explicitly or even implicitly because it talk about an entire procedure of accept the offer or reject it all of it in the hand of the party none of it until the entry of the judgment in the hand of the court and only after the plaintiff have accept the offer in writing so i can not see anything but an inherent power so for me if there be an inherent power it have to be under a default judgment because the other side be say i give up all right let us go from there at least with me and that may answer an early question about an inquest on damage because that be a part of the requirement for a default judgment so that if there be a dispute about damage that can be resolve but my point be that liability be admit now let us deal with the chief s question and justice scalia s question which be in what way be this comparable to a share cost like what motivate our decision in class action that the settlement of one exist plaintiff do not settle the collective action how be this similar to that to get the point the court have to evaluate whether the offer actually meet your personal damage claim too and what you be say in those page be the court do not even do that but what you be talk about be impute into this process a fairness hearing essentially to see by the district court to determine whether this be a quirky case where you enter a judgment and you do not need collective action or whether or not this be a genuine case that require join plaintiff ,238.47,Roberts Court,"Dec 3, 2012","Genesis Healthcare Corp., et al.",Laura Symczyk,11-1059,"Jun 25, 2012","Apr 16, 2013",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2012,Chaidez v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Fisher, I'm concerned that creating exceptions to exceptions in Teague is just a throwback to Linkletter standard-- --where we're making choices among situations and saying, these will be retroactive, these won't. Answer that concern on my part. And then answer -- the next step is the Martinez type case-- --which is what happens with state reviews that are -- that channel IAC claims to their habeas processes. So what trumps what in that situation? Do you think that's true with respect to both components of the advice, the omission and commission? I mean, it does appear that every court who dealt with the commission-type claim, the fraud, the misrepresentation of consequences, said it's clear you can't lie to your client. Now, is Teague now going -- is our ruling here going to depend on the type of claim that's raised, with respect to IAC? At least one of our concurrences did, or talked to. So assuming -- assuming -- is your position that is on the retroactivity, that it applies to both kinds, omissions and commissions, and neither is retroactive? I'm not sure. Are those sources -- when you say sources, it's professional norm sources? Could you tell me where -- my colleagues were asking about hypothetical future cases -- I'm asking, do you think that every evolving professional norm, no matter how well established it becomes, would never be subject to the Teague rule because -- would always be a retroactive application or a new rule? Are we frozen in time to whatever the professional standards are that exist today that the Court has recognized so far? So unanimous error makes right? I'm not being -- I'm not trying to be sarcastic. I'm trying to see -- in almost every case we get here, there are split opinions below. Sometimes the split is significant or closer than other times. The -- where do we draw that line? Where in the next case is any time there is a split below or where there's an unanimity of opinion below, it won't fall under -- it will automatically create a new rule? We -- we're seeming to go backwards. You -- you seem to be arguing against something that you didn't want previously, that there should be a stay and determine these IAC claims on direct appeal. It seems to be your argument that that's the preferred process now. Mr. Fisher, can I go back to one of your points? Your red light is on, but it is important. The floodgate issue. I'm not sure about the floodgates for the following reason. Once we announce Padilla, any pending direct claim and any pending collateral claim that arises after Padilla for something that happened after Padilla would be covered by the rule, so there'd be no bar to those claims.

2012,Lozman v.

As I see our cases, I am -- I'm not quite sure where indefinitely moored came from. I've seen the word permanently moored. You seem to be suggesting a difference between the two things, and I'm not sure where you get the latter, indefinitely moored, from, and how that ties to the concept of purpose. Does it -- does the permanent status or indefinite mooring of a vessel not make it -- of a structure not make it a vessel, and/or does purpose get layered on top of mooring? But it applies to whether something is permanently moored or floating on the sea? Counsel, outside of your floating home, what other structures would be kept out of your definition of purpose or function and the city's definition of practically capable? Can you imagine any other function that's out there floating around? Because they disavow water skis and garage doors and say they're practical, capable tests with-- --Well, I know. But-- So I was right. So that permanent mooring is a different inquiry in your mind? Well, that's a -- that's a somewhat easy case, because the hull, I think, was removed or something was removed that made it-- No. How about a garage door? Under your definition, how do you deal with Evansville? What you are basically saying, we reached the wrong conclusion because the work boat floated, and it regularly was moved, and there was nothing to suggest that it couldn't carry people or things. It happened not to because they would empty it, I understand, before they moved it, but it could have. So if it was practically capable of floating, whether it was semi-tied to land or not, it was released from land on somewhat of a regular basis. So are you suggesting that in Stewart we change the Evansville rule? I guess the problem is the list of absurdities that they point to, not the least of which is a dry dock, which you talk about whether it's permanently moored or not, but most dry docks are held in place by, you know, heavy ropes but you can cut them and you can stick something on them and they can float away. Under -- so how do you-- --For the-- --So what do you do with the-- --Trampoline and the other examples your adversary gave? Is a Trampoline that floats on water capable of moving -- it's moving the Trampoline. It's carrying the Trampoline. So is the difference whether I attach something permanently or temporarily to the top of the floating thing, the floating board, the floating whatever? This is not very compelling in this case because they have regulations that pretty much echo what the Solicitor General is saying, so it's not as if they were going to take a different position.

2012,United States v. Davila,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"It doesn't really matter-- --Excuse me. Does this issue go -- it doesn't go to whether you should apply the prejudice prong, because either under normal harmless error or plain error you have to get to whether it prejudices someone. One of the most powerful arguments of your adversary is that in the most common of situations -- and it's how I read the advisory notes -- it's going to be awfully difficult to say that a judge's intervention hasn't influenced a defendant. This is the unusual case where you might actually have a no prejudice argument because of the unique facts. But there is a purpose for keeping judges out of this, and that's because the subtle influence that judges exert is not so subtle. It's very palpable and does influence most decision making, both by lawyers and defendants. So if that's the standard, why isn't it a rebuttable presumption that prejudice exists? It has to be an awfully high presumption, otherwise, you make mockery of the rule, in my mind. Well, I don't disagree that one doesn't' have to use the word “ rebuttable presumption ”, but there has to be a strong prejudice factor-- --whether rebuttable or not, assumed in a judge's intervention. You're creating a sui generis structural error analysis. You're basically -- because even with respect to constitutional violations that we have found structural error in, we've created the plain error rule that still requires a proof of prejudice. So you're asking us to create something that's really sui generis in saying it's always a structural error. Assume I accept that argument. You're -- you're saying this is a structural error always. Mr. Yablon, I agree with you totally. I'm not as much convinced in the delay in pleading because defendants often think about it and I can imagine a hypothetical where the lawyer comes in and says: I told him to plead guilty and he said to me: I don't want to, but the judge told me to. So I don't think the time limit -- we don't know if that happened. But what did happen is that the defendant made a motion to withdraw his plea and he directly said: ""I entered the plea because I strategically decided that the government would eventually have to come forward and vacate the charges against me. "" He said it himself with no pressure by a lawyer, because he was making the motion. How do you get past that statement? But that is the whole point, which is this may be IAC, but I don't know how -- how you prove that what the magistrate judge said to him led to his decision. That's only if we don't accept that prejudice is a consideration here. That's not the first time that has happened. Do you disagree with how the Fourth and Seventh Circuits and other circuits apply a prejudice analysis, but one that says that it's highly unlikely that you're not going to find prejudice? Do you disagree with their analysis and approach? No. ",it do not really matter excuse me do this issue go it do not go to whether you should apply the prejudice prong because either under normal harmless error or plain error you have to get to whether it prejudice someone one of the most powerful argument of your adversary be that in the most common of situation and it be how i read the advisory note it be go to be awfully difficult to say that a judge s intervention have not influence a defendant this be the unusual case where you might actually have a no prejudice argument because of the unique fact but there be a purpose for keep judge out of this and that be because the subtle influence that judge exert be not so subtle it be very palpable and do influence most decision making both by lawyer and defendant so if that be the standard why be not it a rebuttable presumption that prejudice exists it have to be an awfully high presumption otherwise you make mockery of the rule in my mind well i do not disagree that one do not have to use the word rebuttable presumption but there have to be a strong prejudice factor whether rebuttable or not assume in a judge s intervention you be create a sui generis structural error analysis you be basically because even with respect to constitutional violation that we have find structural error in we have create the plain error rule that still require a proof of prejudice so you be ask us to create something that be really sui generis in say it be always a structural error assume i accept that argument you be you be say this be a structural error always mr yablon i agree with you totally I be not as much convince in the delay in pleading because defendant often think about it and i can imagine a hypothetical where the lawyer come in and say i tell him to plead guilty and he say to me i do not want to but the judge tell me to so i do not think the time limit we do not know if that happen but what do happen be that the defendant make a motion to withdraw his plea and he directly say i enter the plea because i strategically decide that the government would eventually have to come forward and vacate the charge against me he say it himself with no pressure by a lawyer because he be make the motion how do you get past that statement but that be the whole point which be this may be iac but i do not know how how you prove that what the magistrate judge say to him lead to his decision that be only if we do not accept that prejudice be a consideration here that be not the first time that have happen do you disagree with how the fourth and seventh circuit and other circuit apply a prejudice analysis but one that say that it be highly unlikely that you be not go to find prejudice do you disagree with their analysis and approach no ,199.81,Roberts Court,"Apr 15, 2013",United States,Anthony Davila,12-167,"Jan 4, 2013","Jun 13, 2013",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2012,Standard Fire Insurance Company v. Knowles,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Well, why doesn't -- why doesn't the normal class certification process protect adequately the absent class members? First of all, counsel has to prove he or she is adequate. So doesn't that mean that if they enter a stipulation that is grossly unfair to the class that the judge is not going to certify that case? You haven't answered. If -- if the court finds the stipulation inadequate for the class, is that class going to be certified? And then they would get removed to the Federal court, which is what the statute was intended to do. Well, discovery vis a vis the certification of the class is going to happen anyway. My point is that much of your argument in your brief is centered around binding the absent class members. What I'm getting to is that if the stipulation is grossly unfair, there may not be a class at all, or the Plaintiffs who have claims greater than those in the aggregate might opt -- will get notice and opt out. And there is due process challenges if a settlement is entered that is so grossly unfair that it violates due process. So I don't know why the process itself doesn't protect the interests of Congress. But you -- you chimed into this discussion-- --I'm sorry. But it would never involve a judgment that a claim is really worth $50 million and just to defeat this statute, it's being limited to 5. Well, the only strategic reason according to your adversary is they want to stay in State court. Mr. Frederick, your answer just doesn't deal with the component that's been troubling, which is that it doesn't protect the absent class members. In situations like the one Justice Alito or the point Justice Alito made, which is they don't really know how much the entire quantity of the class might truly be, and who's protecting them-- --if it would go your way? So why can't the case be removed at that moment? ",well why do not why do not the normal class certification process protect adequately the absent class member first of all counsel have to prove he or she be adequate so do not that mean that if they enter a stipulation that be grossly unfair to the class that the judge be not go to certify that case you have not answer if if the court find the stipulation inadequate for the class be that class go to be certify and then they would get remove to the federal court which be what the statute be intend to do well discovery vis a vis the certification of the class be go to happen anyway my point be that much of your argument in your brief be center around bind the absent class member what I be get to be that if the stipulation be grossly unfair there may not be a class at all or the plaintiff who have claim great than those in the aggregate might opt will get notice and opt out and there be due process challenge if a settlement be enter that be so grossly unfair that it violate due process so i do not know why the process itself do not protect the interest of congress but you you chime into this discussion I be sorry but it would never involve a judgment that a claim be really worth million and just to defeat this statute it be be limit to well the only strategic reason accord to your adversary be they want to stay in state court mr frederick your answer just do not deal with the component that be be trouble which be that it do not protect the absent class member in situation like the one justice alito or the point justice alito make which be they do not really know how much the entire quantity of the class might truly be and who be protect them if it would go your way so why can not the case be remove at that moment ,134.26999999999998,Roberts Court,"Jan 7, 2013",The Standard Life Insurance Co.,Greg Knowles,11-1450,"Aug 31, 2012","Mar 19, 2013",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2012,Dan's City Used Cars v. Pelkey,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Not payment over towing; payment over storage. If this was a consensual contract, he asked -- Justice Scalia's question. They contracted for the tow. What State laws would be preempted under the FAAAA with respect to that private contract? Would there be any? How about, do consumer fraud laws apply to that contract between the parties? That's the basis of his claim here. Ah, so you're arguing that those laws would be preempted. That gets back to whether the services include storage, which is what the New Hampshire court said it doesn't. That the movement of property or towing doesn't include services for storage. So why don't you answer that question? As I read the list of things that are preempted, they have to do with storage during transportation. Why should we read it more broadly than that? Exactly. That's your problem, which is, what is it directed to? And that's the real issue in this case. Yes, it's preempted with respect to any towing activity. The issue is, is it -- is it preempted, as the New Hampshire court, said to storage and sale? How do we draw the line, that line that you just asked us to draw between direct and indirect? How do we articulate that line? Because now you're -- now you're articulating a different line. You are saying this -- the hypothetical that Justice Kagan posited is not storage-related, it is something else-related. It's towing-related. What's the difference? I think that Justice Breyer is -- I may be speaking for him -- he's thinking that that State contract or that State regulation that permits towing companies to do this is preempted in some way.

2012,Descamps v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Could you simplify that? What do you think the elements of -- just going back to what Justice Scalia said, as I understand your position the elements of a burglary in California law is being in a place with the intent to commit a crime. Whether you got there with permission or without permission, unlawfully or not, is irrelevant. So what you are saying is what he pled guilty to was being in that garage with the intent to commit a crime, correct? But the unlawfulness is not necessary. No matter what he said, he wasn't convicted of a generic crime because all he was convicted of under California law was entering and-- --with intent. That's your point. But that's my problem, which is you say that, but how to define a missing element from an alternative element is -- overbroad element, doesn't make any sense to me. As I read the California statute, all it says is you have to enter a number of defined things with the intent to commit a crime. It doesn't talk about whether the entry itself is unlawful. That's your colleague's -- your opponent's argument. But you're trying to read into the method of entering that it could be legal or illegal, and so you look at the documents to add that. So how do you take that position and advocate the answer you're giving here? Because you are asking us to determine or to have courts below determine what are or are not definitions that the judiciary is applying to means versus mode, et cetera? Could you tell me what the difference is between entering the garage with permission and taking a wrench and walking out, and entering a store with permission and taking an article of clothing. Are they both shoplifting? They are the same thing. So in answer to Justice Breyer's question, you do admit that under the California definition of burglary, shoplifting could be charged. I think your adversary can speak for himself, and his brief did point to some convictions for shoplifting under the statute. There are some. Mr. Johnson, the last answer by Mr. Horwich to the last question was, it would be simpler if we hadn't done the modified categorical approach; but the reality is we have a statute. The active statute that defines violent felony not with respect to a felony that involved dangerous conduct, but as any crime punishable by imprisonment that has an element that threatened use of physical force. So it's not what the Court created, it's what the statute created. ",could you simplify that what do you think the element of just go back to what justice scalia say as i understand your position the element of a burglary in california law be be in a place with the intent to commit a crime whether you get there with permission or without permission unlawfully or not be irrelevant so what you be say be what he plead guilty to be be in that garage with the intent to commit a crime correct but the unlawfulness be not necessary no matter what he say he be not convict of a generic crime because all he be convict of under california law be enter and with intent that be your point but that be my problem which be you say that but how to define a missing element from an alternative element be overbroad element do not make any sense to me as i read the california statute all it say be you have to enter a number of defined thing with the intent to commit a crime it do not talk about whether the entry itself be unlawful that be your colleague s your opponent s argument but you be try to read into the method of enter that it could be legal or illegal and so you look at the document to add that so how do you take that position and advocate the answer you be give here because you be ask us to determine or to have court below determine what be or be not definition that the judiciary be apply to mean versus mode et cetera could you tell me what the difference be between enter the garage with permission and take a wrench and walk out and enter a store with permission and take an article of clothing be they both shoplift they be the same thing so in answer to justice breyer s question you do admit that under the california definition of burglary shoplifting could be charge i think your adversary can speak for himself and his brief do point to some conviction for shoplift under the statute there be some mr johnson the last answer by mr horwich to the last question be it would be simpler if we have not do the modified categorical approach but the reality be we have a statute the active statute that define violent felony not with respect to a felony that involve dangerous conduct but as any crime punishable by imprisonment that have an element that threaten use of physical force so it be not what the court create it be what the statute create ,177.35000000000005,Roberts Court,"Jan 7, 2013",Matthew R.

2012,United States v. Kebodeaux,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"What's the limit of that power? How -- for any Federal conviction, whether it's related to sex offense or anything else, Congress could impose any kind of registration requirement? Could it ask every convicted Federal felon to come in for a DNA test, because we know that people who have been convicted of a crime are more likely to be recidivists? So what -- what is the limit? Is it just safety? It can't be just safety of the public, because you just said that it doesn't apply to recidivist Federal offenders, generally. I don't understand. I just posited a civil registration for Federal offenders of any kind. That's not ex post facto under your theory, so-- --Well, I don't know if I agree with that, but accept -- accepting that hypothetical. No, you know, that's settled law. Whether it's right or wrong is a different issue. Mr. Dreeben-- --As broad as that authority is, perhaps I'm going back to Justice Alito's question, which is if you put aside that it's part of the punishment because you say it's not part of the punishment, you want us not to look at it as punishment because otherwise you'd run into the ex post facto problem, you're saying we have a need today. Outside of protecting the public from a recidivist, what's the interest? Because that wasn't enough in Comstock. We made it very clear that wasn't enough. So if you take out all of the punishment aspects of this, which you should have done at the time he was sentenced and not now, what remains in terms of the Federal interest? What's promoted? But that was -- why did we even bother going through anything in Comstock? If that stands alone as a Federal interest, then anything we do at any point with respect to any person who's violated a Federal law would stand in the same shoes. You could do whatever civil penalties you want for as long as you want. We go back to my initial question and Justice-- Going back to -- to a prior question, are you challenging -- you didn't on appeal, but it seems as if you're accepting that the Federal Government has the power to impose this requirement as part of a Federal sentence. All right. Are you -- if it's not part of a Federal sentence but part of release, it's not announced at the sentence but it's announced at the time the prisoner is put into supervised release or release from jail, do you think the Government has the power to impose it then? Well, SORNA today becomes part of the supervised relief terms. I'm not talking about SORNA today. I'm talking about just any prisoner who has been in jail but it's not made, has not been paid, part of the punishment. I -- I don't know of that power, but do you have a statutory-- --All right. So that power -- I guess then what the Government is saying, as I understand their argument, if you have the power to do it at that point, why can't you have the power to do it later? Are the same factors that compel permission for the Government to do it then? How would you write this opinion if you wanted to protect against what Justice Breyer was concerned about, constricting the Commerce Clause, which has been since Madison more broadly defined than he did, or Justice Alito's example of ensuring that you're not closing off other things that can be done after someone leaves, that might be related to, like punishing a crime that you find out about afterwards. How would you write this opinion? Well, it wasn't really helpful, because it -- it doesn't give us a limiting principle like -- I don't know if it's possible -- that if you're relying on just recidivism, Congress has to have an independent basis, a power for the imposition of -- of criminal or civil sanctions on someone. Your argument is he was released on condition of State registration. Isn't your argument dependent only on that there was no Federal registration requirement? The bottom line is you don't think the Wetterling Act applied to him. Is that your point? The Wetterling Act didn't apply to him; is that-- --At all?

2012,Arkansas Game & Fish Commission v. United States of America,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, all of our cases in this temporary versus permanent, as I read the cases and I read what the multiple facts that each are relying on, it seems to me that our cases have been attempting, in the term “ temporary ”, to encompass a lot of different concepts. Both intentionality, because an accidental issue is not a taking; causation: Did this -- and that's part of Sanguinetti's holding -- did what the government do actually and directly cause the injury at issue? And foreseeability: Is what you intended something whose consequences you could have seen? And they are using that in a multifaceted test, one that the Solicitor General is not trying to endorse here, but one that I think is more consistent with our general jurisprudence in this area. So there is never a simple answer on the question of permanent damage, because you can have permanent damage that's not a taking if all of the other factors I've just mentioned are not in your favor. Is that correct? I guess the problem with this case, and it's part of what's interwoven in your adversary's arguments, is that with flooding it's going to occur naturally anyway. The Government generally builds dams to control that flooding to the benefit of all of the interests along its affected route. And at some point, either the Government is going to -- is going to make a decision that's going to help someone and potentially hurt someone. And the question is, is in all of those situations going to be subject to litigation. The Government's rule -- I call it the Government's rule, but it's -- is basically simple. It can't. Because, if the deviation is temporary -- and that's what the circuit below said -- it's just exercise. It's either a nuisance or temporary trespass, and we're not going to hold the Government responsible for that loss. Assuming it's going to occur in part because flooding is always going to occur, the question is perhaps when. But in any place you have a dam, it's there because flooding was happening. Isn't that the basic argument? And I don't know that you've actually announced the rule that addresses the essence of the policy considerations that are driving the government decision. So tell me how your rule makes this a manageable situation. But that's every flood. But that's every flood. I'm totally confused now. Is Dickinson decided wrong under your theory? They built a dam. It raised the water level and flooded the petitioner's land, and the court gave recompense. But you just said two minutes ago -- or I thought I heard you say -- that when the government builds a dam, even if it floods some people and not others, that there's no taking. After it's-- --So the baseline -- tell me what the baseline is. And perhaps you can answer Justice Kennedy's question more directly. Anything in the reservoir is a taking. Anything downstream is never a taking. I must be -- I must be slow today because I'm -- I'm having significant problem with your articulation of your test. Basically, you're saying once a dam is built -- once a dam is built, no downstream owner has a claim; or, you're building an exception from when the claim can be applied to a downstream owner? It doesn't matter whether it's permanent, reoccurring-- --foreseeable or anything else? But what difference does that make? It's nice that you try to reach consensus. If number 2 is not going to be part of the consensus because he's the one always affected-- --you're saying permanency -- permanency, repetition, nothing counts, he's just -- loses. Is the baseline -- go back to Justice Kennedy's question -- is it before the dam or after the dam, and why is it one or the other? If flooding was going to occur more unpredictably before the dam, and possibly summer flooding of this kind could have happened, do you lose? Even though after the dam and the dam's plan was to ensure that it didn't happen, you would still lose? If natural conditions-- --would have possibly caused this, you would lose? Pre-dam. In the recorded history. I'm not sure that's not open to dispute. There is some argument here that rainfall that was naturally occurring contributed to what was happening to the trees. I think that there is -- at least that's what I understood some of the factual argument to be. ",counsel all of our case in this temporary versus permanent as i read the case and i read what the multiple fact that each be rely on it seem to me that our case have be attempt in the term temporary to encompass a lot of different concept both intentionality because an accidental issue be not a taking causation do this and that be part of sanguinetti s hold do what the government do actually and directly because the injury at issue and foreseeability be what you intend something whose consequence you could have see and they be use that in a multifaceted test one that the solicitor general be not try to endorse here but one that i think be more consistent with our general jurisprudence in this area so there be never a simple answer on the question of permanent damage because you can have permanent damage that be not a take if all of the other factor I have just mention be not in your favor be that correct i guess the problem with this case and it be part of what be interweave in your adversary s argument be that with flood it be go to occur naturally anyway the government generally build dam to control that flood to the benefit of all of the interest along its affected route and at some point either the government be go to be go to make a decision that be go to help someone and potentially hurt someone and the question be be in all of those situation go to be subject to litigation the government s rule i call it the government s rule but it be be basically simple it can not because if the deviation be temporary and that be what the circuit below say it be just exercise it be either a nuisance or temporary trespass and we be not go to hold the government responsible for that loss assume it be go to occur in part because flooding be always go to occur the question be perhaps when but in any place you have a dam it be there because flooding be happen be not that the basic argument and i do not know that you have actually announce the rule that address the essence of the policy consideration that be drive the government decision so tell me how your rule make this a manageable situation but that be every flood but that be every flood I be totally confused now be dickinson decide wrong under your theory they build a dam it raise the water level and flood the petitioner s land and the court give recompense but you just say two minute ago or i think i hear you say that when the government build a dam even if it flood some people and not others that there be no take after it be so the baseline tell me what the baseline be and perhaps you can answer justice kennedy s question more directly anything in the reservoir be a taking anything downstream be never a taking i must be i must be slow today because I be I be have significant problem with your articulation of your test basically you be say once a dam be build once a dam be build no downstream owner have a claim or you be build an exception from when the claim can be apply to a downstream owner it do not matter whether it be permanent reoccurring foreseeable or anything else but what difference do that make it be nice that you try to reach consensus if number be not go to be part of the consensus because he be the one always affect you be say permanency permanency repetition nothing count he be just loses be the baseline go back to justice kennedy s question be it before the dam or after the dam and why be it one or the other if flooding be go to occur more unpredictably before the dam and possibly summer flooding of this kind could have happen do you lose even though after the dam and the dam s plan be to ensure that it do not happen you would still lose if natural condition would have possibly cause this you would lose pre dam in the recorded history I be not sure that be not open to dispute there be some argument here that rainfall that be naturally occur contribute to what be happen to the tree i think that there be at least that be what i understand some of the factual argument to be ,328.3199999999999,Roberts Court,"Oct 3, 2012",Arkansas Game & Fish Commission,United States,11-597,"Apr 2, 2012","Dec 4, 2012",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2012,Sebelius v. Auburn Regional Medical Center,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Excuse me. You don't mention Union Pacific in your brief. How can you be calling what you're doing setting your jurisdictional limits? Didn't we say in Union Pacific that agencies can't do that? You can't define your own jurisdiction. You may or may not be able to establish claim processing rules. That, I think, is a totally different question. But why do you continue to use it as jurisdictional language? Well, in that respect, I think the amici is right. You can't -- if they're jurisdictional, we've clearly said that equitable tolling doesn't apply under any circumstances. So what is good cause if not some form of equitable tolling? Assume for the sake of your answer that the error was intentional. Don't try to go to the facts, but assume the error was intentional. Now answer Justice Alito's question. There -- that might be a contradiction in terms. If this is a claim processing rule, under what theory could you shield yourself against fraudulent conduct, fraudulent concealment? Under what theory of law would an agency's rule be fair and -- and non-arbitrary-- --that shielded it from fraudulent acts. Why do you keep fighting the question? You keep fighting the hypotheticals. There is an intent to save money and an intent not to use the figures that are specified by statute, and that is concealed. In that set of circumstances, if this were a claim processing rule, would you be authorized to treat -- not to -- not to permit the action? It didn't talk about the board. It talks about what a party can do, not what the board can or cannot do. That's not the prototypical limitation that Congress uses when it intends a jurisdictional limit on a court. We have talked about what the -- the fact that there almost is a presumption of a claims processing rule, rather than jurisdictional, unless Congress is clear about that. What policy supports an argument that we should be reading limitations of this kind as jurisdictional, particularly when on the same day the statute was passed the agency, invoking its regulatory powers, treated it like a claim processing? Whatever your colleague argues, a good cause exception, the 3-year exception, everything else is really treating it like a claim processing rule, not as jurisdictional. That was in part the point I raised earlier, which is we look at what the history is to help inform our use of labels. The history here -- you can't ignore it -- is that from its inception, whether it's trying to disclaim it now or not, the agency has not treated it as jurisdictional. It's used the word-- --but it's treated it as a claim processing rule by creating these exceptions. There is -- there is a lot of discussion and confusion between jurisdiction, mandatory claim processing rules, nonmandatory claim processing rules. I could go on and on about the labels. But let's go back to the point Justice Kagan made earlier, which is, assuming we were to treat this as a mandatory claim processing rule, where does that get you? Now, the agency says that means no equitable tolling. Assuming I'm willing to accept that, is equitable tolling the same as fraudulent concealment, which has been treated in the law not as a necessary part of equitable tolling, which has to do with what the plaintiff could have done or not done, but with what a defendant has done or not done? Do you agree with that last statement? Do you think an agency is not permitted to have mandatory claim processing rules? Do you believe an agency is not capable of having mandatory claim processing rules, that it limits the application of equitable principles? Would our review be an APA review, whether the rule is arbitrary or capricious? Excuse me. Is the miscalculation still going on? I mean, this involved-- --claims 12 years ago. But did they continue from that time forward to the present?

2012,Gabelli v. Securities and Exchange Commission,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Liman, I understand your argument, but I have a fundamental difficulty, okay? Bailey and Exploration Company, with statutes not too dissimilar from this one, who read the discovery rule into a fraud claim, both were a civil litigant and for the government. The only way that I can tease out a potential difference between Exploration and this case is somehow that the penalty in this case is not for injury but for punishment, as you called it. Government as enforcer, rather than government as victim. Some of us would say that the common wheel is injured whenever someone breaks a law, so that that distinction between enforcer and victim makes no sense. How do you answer that point? It's acting as a sovereign to protect what it thinks is an ordered society. And if you break that order, you are injuring the society. That's the best-- --Mr. Liman, finishing up a point you were just on previously, what's your position with respect to fraudulent concealment? Doesn't your theory preclude even the application of that to tolling of the statute? But tell me about-- --This is -- it's nice for you to say that. But tell me, having announced your theory, how the next step is avoidable? Under what theory would we say you can't have a discovery rule, but you can have a fraudulent concealment rule? Mr. Liman, I'm a little confused in your answer to Justice Scalia. You said that the underlying case has a 5-year statute of repose for a civil claim. It barely applies, however, those claimants who have -- under your theory, who have been directly injured. The presumption would apply of discovery, if they were claiming a fraud. So are you just arguing that under this statutory scheme there is no application of the discovery? Because of the alternative language of 5 years. Right. That's what I thought those involved. This a very modern problem, but how about the statute of Elizabeth, which talked about penalties as being a criminal sanction but permitted private individuals, not the government, to seek the penalties and keep it. So you cite the statute of James and I look at the statute of Elizabeth and try to find the analogy between which one. Even though private parties could keep the money back then. Could I move you to another issue? If a party can defeat the government's claim of discovery by showing that the government wasn't reasonably diligent, how does a party ever accomplish that? Aren't you going to raise the law enforcement privilege, the -- some other privilege to block discovery? Well, if they fail there, don't you think that they are going to also fail because they are not going to be able to look at your records to figure out exactly what you knew or didn't know?

You're claiming it's clear because the supreme court said it was clear, but the court of appeals in Mangiapane, whether or not it assumed it or not, did an analysis that clearly says that it believes that the definition of legal insanity includes diminished capacity. Its holding didn't need that analysis, because it could have assumed it and then just said: But no notice was given, so the defense fails here. It took the time to analyze just this question and came to a contrary conclusion. Its contrary conclusion was that “ legal insanity ” was a broad enough term under Michigan law to encompass this defense. The court of -- the State supreme court has now said no, it's not. But I don't know that that makes the statute any less ambiguous merely because a court announces that it thin ks it's not. That's -- that's your whole point, isn't it? You can't prove a negative, because if everybody accepts after Mangiapane that the defense exists then trial courts are not going to be excluding it on the basis that the statute excludes it. That's the whole point you are making. Do you have any -- is there any evidence of a trial court holding an exclusion? Or even suggesting one? I'm sorry.

2012,Marx v. General Revenue Corporation,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Didn't -- don't district courts always have the authority to award costs for sanctionable behavior like bad faith? So this provision is duplicate no matter how we read it. It's either duplicative of a power the court already had to award costs for bad faith or it's duplicate of Rule 54. It limits Rule 54. I think your -- your answer is always that Rule 54 obligates court to give costs. And this rule, as you read it, is a permissive grant only. Even in bad faith litigations, a court could choose not to give costs. True. I would assume that if Rule 54, instead of saying what it currently does, said something like ""except as expressly repealed in another statute. "" would what happened here meet that express requirement of repeal? It was Justice Scalia's question to you, but reformulated in a different way. Expressly repealed 54(d). Am I to understand your simple position to be that what Rule 54(d) says is if another provision deals with costs, you're relegated to that other provision. Unless, and this -- you're inverting the express -- unless that provision refers you back to 54. And with that is that there are some statutes that don't. So it's not always peanut butter and jelly. It's peanut butter and honey sometimes. [Laughter] Counsel, it was thinking about prevailing parties because the predecessor sentence-- --But it was talking -- no, prevailing parties. The provision is geared towards prevailing parties in some form. The first sentence says a prevailing plaintiff, not whether it's on a substantial basis or any exception. It says you get fees or you can get fees and costs. So it then decides to limit what a prevailing defendant can do. Isn't that a natural reading? You don't think that there's a serious argument that the first sentence does away with the discretionary nature? So it's a command. 54(d) is permissive according to your earlier argument. And so this does -- it's not superfluous because it went to mandatory.

2012,Fisher v. University of Texas,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"How do you get past Texas v. Lesage with that injury, which says that mere use of race is not cognizable injury sufficient for standing? Can I go to another side? She's graduated. She disclaimed the desire after her application to go to the school at all. She was permitted to apply for the summer program and get in automatically, and she didn't, correct? But she's graduated. Injunctive relief, she's not going to get. So what measure of damages will she get or will she be entitled to? But you have to claim an injury, so what's the injury-- --that you're claiming that would sustain a claim of damages? You still haven't answered how Lesage gets away from that-- --but if there's a -- give me another-- --damages question. What damages-- --The one social studies that this University did said that minority students overwhelmingly, even with the numbers they have now, are feeling isolated. So what do -- why isn't that even under your test? We can go back to whether substantial evidence is adequate, is necessary, or not. Why does their test fail? So could you tell me what a critical mass was? I'm looking at the number of blacks in the University of Texas system. Pre-Grutter, when the State was indisputably still segregating, it was 4 percent. Today, under the post-Grutter system, it's 6 percent. The 2 percent increase is enough for you, even though the State population is at 12 percent? Somehow, they've reached a critical mass with just the 2 percent increase? No -- putting aside -- I don't -- I'm not going to quarrel with you that if demographics alone were being used, I would be somewhat concerned. But you can't seriously suggest that demographics aren't a factor to be looked at in combination with how isolated or not isolated your student body is actually reporting itself to feel? It might be -- it might be insulting to some to be thrown into a pot. So what are you telling us is the standard of critical mass? At what point does a district court or a university know that it doesn't have to do any more to equalize the desegregation that has happened in that particular State over decades, that it's now going to be stuck at a fixed number and it has to change its rules. What's that fixed number? Well, they told -- they told the district court. They took a study of students. They analyzed the composition of their classes, and they determined in their educational judgment that greater diversity, just as we said in Grutter, is a goal of their educational program, and one that includes diversifying classes. So what more proof do you require? Well, but given it was in the evidence, what more do you think they needed? I think I hear all you saying in your brief is the number's fixed now, they got enough, no more is necessary. That's enough now. That's what you're saying. Tell me -- tell me what about their use of race did not fit the narrow tailoring, not the necessity prong as you've defined it, but the narrow tailoring that Grutter required? How is race used by them in a way that violated the terms of Grutter? Assuming that the need is there. I know you're challenging the need. So you have to set a quota for critical mass? So we won't call it a quota; we'll call it a goal, something Grutter said you shouldn't have. Boy, it sounds awfully like a quota to me that Grutter said you should not be doing, that you shouldn't be setting goals, that you shouldn't be setting quotas; you should be setting an individualized assessment of the applicants. Tell me how this system doesn't do that. So now we're going to tell the universities how to run and how to weigh qualifications, too? Could you tell me again how race and their use of race overwhelms those other factors in their system as it's created? Counsel, you are the one who in your brief has assumed that they are valuing different races differently. But Asian numbers have gone up, under however they have structured this PAI. And as I understand their position, race is balanced against other issues like socioeconomics, the strength of the classes people took. It's never a stand alone. So even a white student, I presume, who goes to an entirely black or an entirely Latino school, who becomes class president would get some points because he has or she has proven that they foster or can deal in a diverse environment. That's how I understood their plan; that it's not just giving you a plus because of race, it's combining that with other factors. I -- I put that in the narrow tailoring category, that it is narrowly tailored the way Grutter did, said. Not the necessity prong and not the need prong. Not the necessity prong. I think most of his argument has been centered on that, so-- --Mr. Garre, I think that the issue that my colleagues are asking is, at what point and when do we stop deferring to the University's judgment that race is still necessary? That's the bottom line of this case. And you're saying, and I think rightly because of our cases, that you can't set a quota, because that's what our cases say you can't do. So if we're not going to set a quota, what do you think is the standard we apply to make a judgment? Mr.-- General, I think, as I take your answer, is that the supposition of Justice Alito's question is truly impossible under this system. There are not two identical candidates because there are not identical mechanical factors that -- except the 10 percent plan. Under the PIA, the factors are so varied, so contextually set, that no two applicants ever could be identical in the sense that they hypothesize. Because no two people can be the same-- Is your complaint limited to injunctive relief and the return of the $100? As written, is that what it's limited to? In Arizonans and Alvarez we said any all -- any and other -- all damages is too speculative. Is what you actually see what I said: injunctive relief and the return of the $100. In-- --In Arizonans and Alvarez we said you can't manufacture standing after the fact. Did you ask only for injunctive relief and the $100, specifically? And you would have paid that no matter what; under any system of admission you would have paid the same $100. For what, nominal damages? And then how do you get around Arizonans? She was going to get a better job because she went to a different university? You are not suggesting that if every minority student that got into a university got into only the physical education program; and in this particular university that -- that physical education program includes all the star athletes; so every star athlete in the school happens to be black or Hispanic or Asian or something else, but they have now reached the critical mass of 10, 15, 20 percent -- that the university in that situation couldn't use race? In the holistic way that Grutter permits? No, it's just that every one of their students who happens to be a minority is going to end up in that program. You don't think the university could consider that it needs a different diversity in its other departments? Aren't they saying the same thing when they say, when we are looking at the holistic measure, we are looking for that student who is a -- that minority student who is a nuclear scientist? So you don't want to overrule Grutter, you just want to gut it. You just want to gut it. You don't want to overrule it, but you just want to gut it. Now you want to tell universities that once you reach a certain number, then you can't use race anymore. ",how do you get past texas v lesage with that injury which say that mere use of race be not cognizable injury sufficient for stand can i go to another side she be graduate she disclaim the desire after her application to go to the school at all she be permit to apply for the summer program and get in automatically and she do not correct but she be graduate injunctive relief she be not go to

require well but give it be in the evidence what more do you think they need i think i hear all you say in your brief be the number s fix now they get enough no more be necessary that be enough now

So you're taking -- you're disagreeing with the proposition of our older cases that to -- for there to be an ex post facto violation, you have to have a legal consequence. Well, there's a -- there's the disconnect for me. Yes, I do accept that the district courts have to consider the guidelines, but how do you tie that to the requirement that the punishment has to be tied to the guidelines? You're assuming that's changed over time. It wasn't. [Laughter] Can you tell me the narrow rule that you would propose-- --getting back to Justice Scalia-- --which is procedures change risks. Having a victim testify at sentences -- at a sentence is likely, if you examined it statistically, to increase -- increase the sentence. So assume that's the set of hypotheticals. You change it, now victims can. Why is that not or is it an ex post facto change? So why is this not procedural? Give me the rule where I can draw a line between those changes that are permissible and those that are not, not the general statement you're making, because both increase the risk of a higher sentence. So it can't be that. You're answering me differently now? You're answering me differently? I posed exactly the question that Justice Scalia-- --I said the sentencing -- the assumptions I made were the sentencing law changes, victims must testify, judges must consider what they say, and after 5 years it's proven that when victims speak the sentences are higher. Is that a substantive or a procedural law? I'm asking you to draw it. So tell me what's the rule? Do you want something as broad that says even that kind of change can be an ex post facto? And if you don't, articulate how I draw the line? What does that mean to you, the number of years in jail? Is that as limited as you want it to be? Well, we know that's Miller. This is not Miller. Have you had -- are you aware of any circuit court case in recent time where a circuit has reversed the lower range than the guideline, basically because the deviation from the guideline was unreasonable? Why are you fighting this proposition? Because the starting point doesn't matter. Why didn't you stick to your old position that judges should start from the old one and simply consider the new one? Why this whole Supreme Court case? Practically speaking, do you believe it makes no difference? What is the reason that miscalculating a guideline is considered a procedural error? That begs the question. Obviously, if we hold it's a procedural error to miscalculate the guidelines, using the guidelines has some significant importance in the process. I know there is a lot of dispute now about the child pornography sentences. Let's assume -- and this goes back to Justice Breyer's question -- a judge comes in and says: I know child pornography is criminal, but I don't think what the guidelines are imposing are fair to any defendant. So, 10 days in jail. Why would that be substantively unreasonable? No, I'm giving you exactly what the judge says. You don't think that the appellate court would say that's substantively unreasonable because it's not giving due deference to the commission's assessment of the seriousness of this crime? ",be that what your definition of legal consequence be so you be take you be disagree with the proposition of our old case that to for there to be an ex post facto violation you have to have a legal consequence well there be a there be the disconnect for me yes i do accept that the district court have to consider the guideline but how do you tie that to the requirement that the punishment have to be tie to the guideline you be assume that be change over time it be not laughter can you tell me the narrow rule that you would propose get back to justice scalia which be procedure change risk have a victim testify at sentence at a sentence be likely if you examine it statistically to increase increase the sentence so assume that be the set of hypothetical you change it now victim can why be that not or be it an ex post facto change so why be this not procedural give me the rule where i can draw a line between those change that be permissible and those that be not not the general statement you be make because both increase the risk of a high sentence so it can not be that you be answer me differently now you be answer me differently i pose exactly the question that justice scalia i say the sentence the assumption i make we be the sentence law change victim must testify judge must consider what they say and after year it be prove that when victim speak the sentence be high be that a substantive or a procedural law I be ask you to draw it so tell me what be the rule do you want something as broad that say even that kind of change can be an ex post facto and if you do not articulate how i draw the line what do that mean to you the number of year in jail be that as limit as you want it to be well we know that be miller this be not miller have you have be you aware of any circuit court case in recent time where a circuit have reverse the low range than the guideline basically because the deviation from the guideline be unreasonable why be you fight this proposition because the starting point do not matter why do not you stick to your old position that judge should start from the old one and simply consider the new one why this whole supreme court case practically speak do you believe it make no difference what be the reason that miscalculate a guideline be consider a procedural error that beg the question obviously if we hold it be a procedural error to miscalculate the guideline use the guideline have some significant importance in the process i know there be a lot of dispute now about the child pornography sentence let us assume and this go back to justice breyer s question a judge come in and say i know child pornography be criminal but i do not think what the guideline be impose be fair to any defendant so day in jail why would that be substantively unreasonable no I be give you exactly what the judge say you do not think that the appellate court would say that be substantively unreasonable because it be not give due deference to the commission s assessment of the seriousness of this crime ,235.41,Roberts Court,"Feb 26, 2013",Marvin Peugh,United States,12-62,"Nov 9, 2012","Jun 10, 2013",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2012,Trevino v. Thaler,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, I don't know that you've answered Justice Ginsburg's question. And so I'm going to take it up, because it interests me. Let's assume, as she did in her hypothetical, that a State says -- doesn't have any case law like Texas does that says we prefer you to go that way for non-record-based claims. Is the difference between that hypothetical State that says you can do either and the Texas situation, is that Texas in your mind puts up procedural impediments to using the direct appeal mechanism, and so that if the other State hasn't done that, has made the development of evidence, has provided a full opportunity for you to develop a record before the direct appeal is over with, that State wouldn't be subject to Martinez, and Texas is subject to it only because it has the procedural impediments? Counsel, you -- you started to answer this question, but it is something raised by many of the amici opposing your position, which is that by adopting your position we're essentially having to examine the 49 plus, because we have territories that have collateral and direct review as well, plus systems to see which apply -- to which Martinez applies and to which Martinez doesn't apply. And so the question is, how do we write this to sort of give enough guidance so that we're not examining each of the 49 -- or 49 systems, or maybe 48 after we've decided Martinez? And why should we not fear that outcome? Counsel, could you just please-- --Let me understand what you are suggesting. Counsel doesn't have a record, he or she is newly appointed. Can they go into court and say, I don't know if there is an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, but I need to protect my client and abate this hearing now until I get the trial record, whether it takes 6 months, 7 months or a year. What will the court do with its rule that requires counsel to provide affidavits setting forth the good faith basis for a claim? How many were given an indefinite stay until they got the trial record to set forth the affidavits? So what do you do with the 75-day rule, which I think is absolute, which says if the court hasn't ruled on the new trial within 75 days the matter ends? Some of them have the information and some don't. All right. So-- --The guys who do it, it's because they have the information and so they've exhausted their claim. But we are talking about the people who don't. That assumes you get the transcript. No, the 75 days has passed. Even if you haven't made the new trial motion within the 30 days initially? Can I -- can I go back to what you are proposing, and what you are saying this system stands for? If an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is brought on direct appeal with or without a record, or it says, we don't have a record, it throws it into collateral review, as I have seen it do dozens of times -- are you saying in that situation that Martinez applies? Counsel raised it but was told, we're not going to decide it. Puts them into collateral review. Does Martinez apply there. Forget it -- when it happens-- --Okay. So they haven't gotten a full and fair opportunity because they presented their case but Texas has said, we don't want to do it here. Do it there. You are still saying Martinez doesn't apply? So -- because it can but Texas chose not to, now there's no protection, there is no full and fair opportunity for the petitioner to have had that claim adjudicated? That's really the end result of what you're saying. You raised it, and the State said, wow, go to collateral review. You're saying, no Martinez protection? The counsel was ineffective in habeas in that -- in State habeas, you can do nothing about it. ",counsel i do not know that you have answer justice ginsburg s question and so I be go to take it up because it interest me let us assume as she do in her hypothetical that a state say do not have any case law like texas do that say we prefer you to go that way for non record base claim be the difference between that hypothetical state that say you can do either and the texas situation be that texas in your mind put up procedural impediment to use the direct appeal mechanism and so that if the other state have not do that have make the development of evidence have provide a full opportunity for you to develop a record before the direct appeal be over with that state would not be subject to martinez and texas be subject to it only because it have the procedural impediment counsel you you start to answer this question but it be something raise by many of the amici oppose your position which be that by adopt your position we be essentially have to examine the plus because we have territory that have collateral and direct review as well plus system to see which apply to which martinez applies and to which martinez do not apply and so the question be how do we write this to sort of give enough guidance so that we be not examine each of the or system or maybe after we have decide martinez and why should we not fear that outcome counsel could you just please let me understand what you be suggest counsel do not have a record he or she be newly appoint can they go into court and say i do not know if there be an ineffective assistance of counsel claim but i need to protect my client and abate this hearing now until i get the trial record whether it take month month or a year what will the court do with its rule that require counsel to provide affidavit set forth the good faith basis for a claim how many we be give an indefinite stay until they get the trial record to set forth the affidavit so what do you do with the day rule which i think be absolute which say if the court have not rule on the new trial within day the matter end some of them have the information and some do not all right so the guy who do it it be because they have the information and so they have exhaust their claim but we be talk about the people who do not that assume you get the transcript no the day have pass even if you have not make the new trial motion within the day initially can i can i go back to what you be propose and what you be say this system stand for if an ineffective assistance of counsel claim be bring on direct appeal with or without a record or it say we do not have a record it throw it into collateral review as i have see it do dozen of time be you say in that situation that martinez applies counsel raise it but be tell we be not go to decide it put them into collateral review do martinez apply there forget it when it happen okay so they have not get a full and fair opportunity because they present their case but texas have say we do not want to do it here do it there you be still say martinez do not apply so because it can but texas chose not to now there be no protection there be no full and fair opportunity for the petitioner to have have that claim adjudicate that be really the end result of what you be say you raise it and the state say wow go to collateral review you be say no martinez protection the counsel be ineffective in habeas in that in state habeas you can do nothing about it ,275.48999999999995,Roberts Court,"Feb 25, 2013",Carlos Trevino,"Rick Thaler, Director, Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Correctional Institutions Division",11-10189,"Oct 29, 2012","May 28, 2013",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2012,Sebelius v. Cloer,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Horwich-- --That sounds like a jurisdictional argument to me. But I understand the Government to be conceding that this statute of limitations is not jurisdictional. It's just a claim processing item. I totally lost that answer. Could you -- could you go back and talk to me again about what you mean about not having a record? I'm totally confused. Are you suggesting that the record shouldn't be filed in that case or that the record supports the conclusion that it was untimely? Or neither? Excuse me. Could you -- could you -- there seems to be a confusion in this consequence conversation. You seem to be assuming that the attorneys' fee award on good faith basis has to do with the ultimate merits, did the vaccine cause this injury. I would have assumed that the award of attorneys' fees has to do with whether the petition was brought in good faith; i.e., was there a reasonable basis to believe that the petition was timely. And on that issue, before the Court can adjudicate the timeliness question, it has to know all of the facts that made the petitioner believe it was timely. And so I'm a little bit confused as to what additional factfinding the Court has to do. It has to be told by a lawyer, your cases say because reasonable basis has to be in fact and law. The law says first symptom. She experienced X, Y, and Z, and we thought the latter was the starting point of the statute, not the former. What more does the Special Master need to know to adjudicate whether that's in good faith, that belief is in good faith? Now, I understand. So how do you answer the argument about a shadow trial? How were the records accumulated and when? How were the records accumulated and when? So is your bottom line that the record is already there for the shadow determination? They are arguing that they don't need to, and why should be -- why should they be put to the burden of doing that. Do you have any idea from the cases what the ranges are? For rates. I know that civil rights rates, for example, are far below market rates for most law firms. Is that the same for this, or is it market rates generally? Market rates for general litigation. Right. Do you have some evidence -- numbers -- to tell us how complicated the fee award disputes are generally -- putting aside, because it hasn't until recently been an issue for cases dismissed -- but for other cases, particularly those dismissed on -- other procedural grounds. But there have been dismissals on other procedural grounds.

2012,"City of Arlington, TX v. FCC",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Goldstein, could you go back to the question presented? I have read a lot of briefs in this case and I don't have any idea what to tell a lower court, how to articulate the tests or how to apply it. Given that you started with saying it's almost impossible to talk about what's jurisdictional and what's an application of jurisdiction. So articulate the test and tell me what I tell the lower courts. So that's what the court here did. It looked at the Communications Act, it said, It has the power-- --to pass regulations with respect to this Act. There is no clear exception. I still haven't quite understood, other than in the academic literature, what the difference between Step Zero and Step One is, and so there is an ambiguity and now the agency is given deference. So where in this conversation is there-- All right. General, let's go back to the question presented and break down your argument. Is it your position that what the Court asks first is whether Congress has spoken clearly on the agency having authority or not? Is that subject to de novo review? All right. But tell me what gets deference when and what's subject to de novo review. So deal with the three cases he mentioned. General, if the agency had said reasonable is 30 days, period, and not done what it did, which was create a rebuttable presumption, would that have been appropriate? Would we have had to uphold that? And if not, I think -- how would we have struck it down? What step?

2012,Shelby County v. Holder,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"May I ask you a question? Assuming I accept your premise, and there's some question about that, that some portions of the South have changed, your county pretty much hasn't. In -- in the period we're talking about, it has many more discriminating -- 240 discriminatory voting laws that were blocked by Section 5 objections. There were numerous remedied by Section 2 litigation. You may be the wrong party bringing this. But that's the standard. And why would we vote in favor of a county whose record is the epitome of what caused the passage of this law to start with? But facial challenges are generally disfavored in our law. And so the question becomes, why do we strike down a formula, as Justice Kagan said, which under any circumstance the record shows the remedy would be congruent, proportional, rational, whatever standard of review we apply, its application to Alabama would happen. Interestingly enough, in Katzenbach the Court didn't do what you're asking us to do, which is to look at the record of all the other States or all of the other counties. It basically concentrated on the record of the two litigants in the case, and from that extrapolate -- extrapolated more broadly. You're asking us to do something, which is to ignore your record and look at everybody else's. The problem with those hypotheticals is obvious that it starts from a predicate that the application has no basis in any record, but there's no question that Alabama was rightly included in the original Voting Rights Act. There's no challenge to the reauthorization acts. The only question is whether a formula should be applied today. And the point is that the record is replete with evidence to show that you should. It's not like there's some made-up reason for why the $1,000 is being applied to you or why a different crime is going to be charged against you. It's a real record as to what Alabama has done to earn its place on the list. Counsel, the reason Section 5 was created was because States were moving faster than litigation permitted to catch the new forms of discriminatory practices that were being developed. As the courts struck down one form, the States would find another. And basically, Justice Ginsburg calls it secondary. I don't know that I'd call anything secondary or primary. Discrimination is discrimination. And what Congress said is it continues, not in terms of voter numbers, but in terms of examples of other ways to disenfranchise voters, like moving a voting booth from a convenient location for all voters to a place that historically has been known for discrimination. I think that's an example taken from one of the Section 2 and 5 cases from Alabama. I mean, I don't know what the difference is except that this Court or some may think that secondary is not important. But the form of discrimination is still discrimination if Congress has found it to be so. But that's not-- --what it did with Section 5. It said we can't keep up with the way States are doing it. It was on voter dilution as well. It had already evolved away from that, or started to. Counsel, are you-- --Why? Why does Congress have to fix any problem immediately? I'm going to have a hard time with that because you can't be suggesting that the Government sees a problem in one or more States and decides it's going to do something for them and not for others, like emergency relief, and that that somehow violates the equal footing doctrine. You can't treat States the same because their problems are different, their populations are different, their needs are different. Everything is different about the States. Would you tell me what you think is left of the rational means test in Katzenbach and City of Rome? Do you think the City of Boerne now controls both Fourteen -- the Fourteenth and the Fifteenth Amendment and how we look at any case that arises under them? Counsel, in the reauthorization-- Do you think that the right to vote is a racial entitlement in Section 5? I asked a different question. Do you think Section 5 was voted for because it was a racial entitlement? Do you think there was no basis to find that-- --Do you think that racial discrimination in voting has ended, that there is none anywhere? But shouldn't-- --You've given me some statistics that Alabama hasn't, but there are others that are very compelling that it has. Why should we make the judgment, and not Congress, about the types and forms of discrimination and the need to remedy them? How many other States have 240 successful Section 2 and Section 5-- ",may i ask you a question assume i accept your premise and there be some question about that that some portion of the south have change your county pretty much have not in in the period we be talk about it have many more discriminate discriminatory voting law that we be block by section objection there we be numerous remedied by section litigation you may be the wrong party bring this but that be the standard and why would we vote in favor of a county whose record be the epitome of what cause the passage of this law to start with but facial challenge be generally disfavor in our law and so the question become why do we strike down a formula as justice kagan say which under any circumstance the record show the remedy would be congruent proportional rational whatever standard of review we apply its application to alabama would happen interestingly enough in katzenbach the court do not do what you be ask us to do which be to look at the record of all the other state or all of the other county it basically concentrate on the record of the two litigant in the case and from that extrapolate extrapolate more broadly you be ask us to do something which be to ignore your record and look at everybody else s the problem with those hypothetical be obvious that it start from a predicate that the application have no basis in any record but there be no question that alabama be rightly include in the original voting right act there be no challenge to the reauthorization act the only question be whether a formula should be apply today and the point be that the record be replete with evidence to show that you should it be not like there be some make up reason for why the be be apply to you or why a different crime be go to be charge against you it be a real record as to what alabama have do to earn its place on the list counsel the reason section be create be because state we be move faster than litigation permit to catch the new form of discriminatory practice that we be be develop as the court strike down one form the state would find another and basically justice ginsburg call it secondary i do not know that I would call anything secondary or primary discrimination be discrimination and what congress say be it continue not in term of voter number but in term of example of other way to disenfranchise voter like move a vote booth from a convenient location for all voter to a place that historically have be know for discrimination i think that be an example take from one of the section and case from alabama i mean i do not know what the difference be except that this court or some may think that secondary be not important but the form of discrimination be still discrimination if congress have find it to be so but that be not what it do with section it say we can not keep up with the way state be do it it be on voter dilution as well it have already evolve away from that or start to counsel be you why why do congress have to fix any problem immediately I be go to have a hard time with that because you can not be suggest that the government see a problem in one or more state and decides it be go to do something for them and not for others like emergency relief and that that somehow violate the equal footing doctrine you can not treat state the same because their problem be different their population be different their need be different everything be different about the state would you tell me what you think be leave of the rational mean test in katzenbach and city of rome do you think the city of boerne now control both fourteen the fourteenth and the fifteenth amendment and how we look at any case that arise under them counsel in the reauthorization do you think that the right to vote be a racial entitlement in section i ask a different question do you think section be vote for because it be a racial entitlement do you think there be no basis to find that do you think that racial discrimination in voting have end that there be none anywhere but should not you have give me some statistic that alabama have not but there be others that be very compel that it have why should we make the judgment and not congress about the type and form of discrimination and the need to remedy them how many other state have successful section and section ,324.5900000000001,Roberts Court,"Feb 27, 2013","Shelby County, Alabama","Eric Holder, Jr. Attorney General",12-96,"Nov 9, 2012","Jun 25, 2013",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2012,Clapper v. Amnesty International USA,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"General, is there anybody who has standing?

General, I don't know that you've answered my question. Perhaps you have, but I just want to make sure that I'm clear. Given that lawyers are unlikely to be the targets of an investigation, if their conversations would be intercepted, according to you they'd never have standing. Now we're back at the same circle we started with, which is the one that Justice Breyer started with. He pointed to one person under -- who has been surveilled continuously, tens of thousands of interceptions. Can you really say that the government's not going to target him under this greater authority that it sought just for the purpose of ensuring that it casts a broader net? Counsel, I have an issue-- --Could you address-- --Can you go back to being a little bit more specific on this? I think I got it.

2012,Levin v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"One of the strongest arguments by your adversary has to do with the incongruity between these claims and the Westfall ruling by this Court. It's more a policy argument than a language argument, but how do you address the fact that we will be interpreting essentially two statutes that are almost identical but with different conclusions if we were to adopt your view. Are there any -- I'm sorry. Are there any other tort claims besides the lack of consent battery claim at issue here that could be encompassed by the Intentional Tort Act as it relates to medical malpractice? Let's assume that it's not an operation, but sexual behavior with a patient in their hospital room, something of that nature. Is that covered under the Gonzalez Act as a claim against the United States? This exception you're talking about is regularly applied in the lower courts? In the lower courts, this determination is regularly made? What do you need more clear than (h) doesn't apply? I mean, I don't know how much clearer Congress has to get than to say it's nullified.

I know you'll tell us don't look at the Congressional Record because it suits you right now, because when it doesn't you point to it extensively.

2013,Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Holt had nothing to do with an antidiscrimination law. It had to do with a remedy, defective segregation. Why isn't this identical to Seattle? You don't think that the proponents of affirmative action are attempting to do the same thing? One of the bill sponsors here said that this constitutional amendment will bring back desegregation in Michigan, and it appears to have done just that. I thought that in Grutter, all of the social scientists had pointed out to the fact that all of those efforts had failed. That's one of the reasons why the -- I think it was a law school claim in Michigan was upheld. It's always wonderful for minorities that they finally get in, they finally have children and now you're going to do away for that preference for them. It seems that the game posts keeps changing every few years for minorities. I don't see the distinction. Bussing could be viewed, and was viewed, to benefit only one group. It was a preference for blacks to get into better schools. That's the way the case was pitched, that was its justification, and to integrate the society. Affirmative action has the same gain. We've said that in Fisher; it should be to diversify the population, so it favors diversity as opposed to desegregation. But I don't see how the argument would be any different here. One of the main sponsors of this bill said it was intended to segregate again. The voters in Seattle were not all filled with animus; some of them just cared about their children not leaving -- not having outsiders come in. I mean, there's always voters who have good intent. In Seattle as well. So it wasn't the issue of animus that drove Seattle. So what do we do with the statistics from California? An amici from California, their attorney general, has shown, another State with a similar proposition, has shown the dramatic drop. So why is it okay to have taken away -- not okay to have taken away the decision to have bussing from the local school boards, the people on the ground, but it's okay to take that power away from the people on the ground here, the board of regents, who are also elected like the school board was in Seattle? The general population has feelings about many things, but the only decision that they're -- educational decision that they are taking away from the board of regents is this one: affirmative action. Everything else they leave within the elected board of regents. You've done something much more. You are basically saying, because Fisher and Grutter -- we've always applied strict scrutiny-- --all right. So it's essentially a last resort, within some reason. But what you are saying, if all those other measures fail, you're by Constitution saying you can't go to the remedy that might work. Well, but you're -- but this amendment is stopping the political process. It's saying the board of regents can do everything else in the field of education except this one. It can't be that, because the normal political process imposes burdens on different groups. I thought the line was a very simple one, which is if the normal academic decision-making is in the dean, the faculty, at whatever level, as long as the normal right to control is being exercised, then that person could change the decision. So if they delegate most admissions decisions, as I understand from the record, to the faculty, but they still regularly, besides race, veto some of those decisions, and race is now one of them, then the Board of Regents can do that normally. So could the president, if that's the way it's normally done. It's when the process is -- political process has changed specifically and only for race, as a constitutional amendment here was intended to do, that the political doctrine is violated. Have I restated? Diversity does, but when you take away a tool for diversity that's what Seattle is saying is wrong. You can't take the tool away simply because it may include race as a factor, simply because you are changing the playing field. ",holt have nothing to do with an antidiscrimination law it have to do with a remedy defective segregation why be not this identical to seattle you do not think that the proponent of affirmative action be attempt to do the same thing one of the bill sponsor here say that this constitutional amendment will bring back desegregation in michigan and it appear to have do just that i think that in grutter all of the social scientist have point out to the fact that all of those effort have fail that be one of the reason why the i think it be a law school claim in michigan be upheld it be always wonderful for minority that they finally get in they finally have child and now you be go to do away for that preference for them it seem that the game post keep change every few year for minority i do not see the distinction bussing could be view and be view to benefit only one group it be a preference for black to get into good school that be the way the case be pitch that be its justification and to integrate the society affirmative action have the same gain we have say that in fisher it should be to diversify the population so it favor diversity as oppose to desegregation but i do not see how the argument would be any different here one of the main sponsor of this bill say it be intend to segregate again the voter in seattle we be not all fill with animus some of them just care about their child not leave not have outsider come in i mean there be always voter who have good intent in seattle as well so it be not the issue of animus that drive seattle so what do we do with the statistic from california an amici from california their attorney general have show another state with a similar proposition have show the dramatic drop so why be it okay to have take away not okay to have take away the decision to have buss from the local school board the people on the ground but it be okay to take that power away from the people on the ground here the board of regent who be also elect like the school board be in seattle the general population have feeling about many thing but the only decision that they be educational decision that they be take away from the board of regent be this one affirmative action everything else they leave within the elect board of regent you have do something much more you be basically say because fisher and grutter we have always apply strict scrutiny all right so it be essentially a last resort within some reason but what you be say if all those other measure fail you be by constitution say you can not go to the remedy that might work well but you be but this amendment be stop the political process it be say the board of regent can do everything else in the field of education except this one it can not be that because the normal political process imposes burden on different group i think the line be a very simple one which be if the normal academic decision making be in the dean the faculty at whatever level as long as the normal right to control be be exercise then that person could change the decision so if they delegate most admission decision as i understand from the record to the faculty but they still regularly besides race veto some of those decision and race be now one of them then the board of regent can do that normally so could the president if that be the way it be normally do it be when the process be political process have change specifically and only for race as a constitutional amendment here be intend to do that the political doctrine be violate have i restate diversity do but when you take away a tool for diversity that be what seattle be say be wrong you can not take the tool away simply because it may include race as a factor simply because you be change the playing field ,287.5,Roberts Court,"Oct 15, 2013",Schuette,"Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al.",12-682,"Mar 25, 2013","Apr 22, 2014",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2013,Executive Benefits Insurance Agency v. Arkison,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Are you talking about a mere formality? Are you arguing that because it was the bankruptcy judge and not the district court judge who signed the final judgment, that that makes a difference? That's the essence of your argument. So if we vacated and remanded, and the district court looked at this, because it's already seen it, and basically just signed below the line that the bankruptcy judge signed, you would be okay? It reviewed this case de novo. And it decided that there were no issues, no factual issues in dispute and that the law clearly applied the way it did. I don't understand why that option was taken away from it on appellate review. So are you saying, contrary to our case law, that you can never have implied consent? We have held differently in other cases. I'm a little confused. Let's just save your time. I'll ask on rebuttal. All right. Can I go to that for a second? Because let's deal with statutory language, okay? I get the core of your argument to be as follows; pardon the puns. That for statutorily core proceedings that constitutionally are not core-- --we should treat them as noncore proceedings. Am I at your point? So if we're going to accord them the same treatment-- --what do I do with Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure 7012-- --which explicitly states, quote: ""In noncore proceedings, final orders and judgments shall not be entered on the bankruptcy judge's order except with the “ express consent of the parties ”. "" So, now you're telling me we're going to have a third category. Makes very little sense to me, okay? Which is you need express consent for a magistrate judge to issue a final judgment in a noncore proceeding, but you can have express or implied consent to enter the final judgment in core proceedings. That -- that makes very -- I understand treating it like noncore proceeding, but if we're going to treat it that way, then I think you have to treat it that way for all purposes, not pick and choose the ones you want. The language of Roell, the magistrate judge's language didn't use the word -- the language in Roell, the magistrate judge's language didn't use the word “ express consent ”. It just -- the part -- ""the clerk shall give written notice to the parties of their opportunity to consent to the exercise. "" So the word “ express ” was not in the magistrate judge's act. No, here you have to express consent. Got it. Okay. Now I understand. And the answer suggested it because we he was claiming the fraudulent conveyance claim in his answer was noncore. So he had the basis of the argument. But you had an outstanding motion to withdraw the reference. And the District Court gave you the option of proceeding with that motion and having it determine the rest of the case or to go and listen -- or go back to the bankruptcy court and let the bankruptcy court manage this and you chose the latter. I think obviously for the reasons your -- your adversary speaks about, because your co-defendant had won in bankruptcy court. I think you were riding your chances. ",be you talk about a mere formality be you argue that because it be the bankruptcy judge and not the district court judge who sign the final judgment that that make a difference that be the essence of your argument so if we vacate and remand and the district court look at this because it be already see it and basically just sign below the line that the bankruptcy judge sign you would be okay it review this case de novo and it decide that there we be no issue no factual issue in dispute and that the law clearly apply the way it do i do not understand why that option be take away from it on appellate review so be you say contrary to our case law that you can never have imply consent we have hold differently in other case I be a little confused let us just save your time I will ask on rebuttal all right can i go to that for a second because let us deal with statutory language okay i get the core of your argument to be as follow pardon the pun that for statutorily core proceeding that constitutionally be not core we should treat them as noncore proceeding be i at your point so if we be go to accord them the same treatment what do i do with federal rule of bankruptcy procedure which explicitly state quote in noncore proceeding final order and judgment shall not be enter on the bankruptcy judge s order except with the express consent of the party so now you be tell me we be go to have a third category make very little sense to me okay which be you need express consent for a magistrate judge to issue a final judgment in a noncore proceeding but you can have express or implied consent to enter the final judgment in core proceeding that that make very i understand treat it like noncore proceeding but if we be go to treat it that way then i think you have to treat it that way for all purpose not pick and choose the one you want the language of roell the magistrate judge s language do not use the word the language in roell the magistrate judge s language do not use the word express consent it just the part the clerk shall give write notice to the party of their opportunity to consent to the exercise so the word express be not in the magistrate judge s act no here you have to express consent get it okay now i understand and the answer suggest it because we he be claim the fraudulent conveyance claim in his answer be noncore so he have the basis of the argument but you have an outstanding motion to withdraw the reference and the district court give you the option of proceed with that motion and have it determine the rest of the case or to go and listen or go back to the bankruptcy court and let the bankruptcy court manage this and you choose the latter i think obviously for the reason your your adversary speaks about because your co defendant have win in bankruptcy court i think you we be rid your chance ,224.52000000000004,Roberts Court,"Jan 14, 2014",Executive Benefits Insurance Agency,Peter H.

2013,Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, before you go on, could you address the jurisdiction question for me? I'm not sure why you're here. The only injunction that I see was entered on behalf of Little -- Little Traverse's and not on behalf of the State. And so, the counts that you're arguing about were added after the injunction was issued. How do you have jurisdiction to act -- to argue someone else's injunction? That, in fact, is not what the district court said. The district court explicitly said in its order granting the injunction that the State hadn't filed an injunction, hadn't intervened and had only filed supporting papers in support of Little Traverse's case. I'm a little -- I'm very, very confused as I looked at what the district court said. It explicitly said you weren't part of the order. I think “ consolidated ” can have two meanings and -- and -- to be heard together or to be joined together. I don't think the district court understood that this was going to be joined together. Why did it say what it did? So why didn't you file an injunction -- why does your brief say that you filed it only in support of Little Traverse and not on your own behalf? I'll ask -- I'll ask your opposition, but I don't see why the district court would have made the point it did if it believed that it was dealing with both of you as parties. No, but we have to -- we have to, if we're not sure, raise any jurisdictional issue. Well, it wasn't eminently clear to the district court who entered the order. All roads lead to one issue, I think. If you had gotten a declaratory judgment, they would have had to stop their gaming activity. But you wouldn't have gotten their property; isn't that what this suit is about, you trying to take over the -- the casino? So why not Ex Parte Young? You point to one or two cases in the lower courts that suggest there not might be Ex Parte Younger jurisdiction, but those cases are distinguishable. So why not go after just the officials? But all you wanted to do was stop them from doing the gaming casino. You would have gotten that. Could I ask you a question? Could I ask you a question? What -- what would happen if this were Indian lands, and they went ahead and did exactly what they did? They -- there was no dispute that these were Indian lands. Would you have had grounds to object to them building a casino on these lands? You would not. All right. The issue of what constitutes Indian lands is between the Federal government and the Indians pursuant to the land trust settlement, correct? Well, I know you do and I know why you do. But -- but what defines the lands is the settlement trust, correct? Put -- put this aside of gambling. Let's assume that it was just their buying this land. Could you have stopped the buying of this land or unravelled it? Didn't we have a recent decision that said no? Yes. Well, wouldn't you have had to follow -- if you were going to object to this land being taken into the land trust, wouldn't you have had to follow the administrative process? How do you win in an arbitration when the gaming commission has said it's not Indian lands? I mean, I actually am not sure that the ruling of the district court was right on this, okay? But putting my own beliefs or questions about that ruling, how do you win as the Federal government has said it's not Indian lands? But how does the arbitration board change the mind of the gaming commission? Aren't they the final deciders of whether this is trust land or not? Just so we understand-- --What happens if you can't convince the Federal government that these are Indian lands, and despite the gaming commission's final ruling, there is no other way to overturn it, you decide to operate the casino. It's not Indian lands by the Federal government. You haven't convinced them otherwise. What occurs at that moment? Who can stop you and using what mechanisms? Well, the compact only comes into play if it's Indian lands. But if the Federal government has said it's not Indian lands, that's what I'm asking. Then go back to the beginning question. You have remedies you don't like, but the waiver under IGRA is not for damages. It's only for injunctive relief. You have that in Ex parte Young. Why are you asking us to waive sovereign immunity with respect to damages?

So unless you parse the prayers, you can't determine whether there's proselytizing or damnation. That is Judge Wilkinson's point when he was faced with this question, which is, you have to, to do some parsing. Now, seriously, counselor. You can't argue that the quote that Justice Kagan read is not sectarian. It invokes Jesus Christ as the savior of the world. There are many religions who don't believe that. Let's get past that. This is sectarian. So let's talk about the context instead of prayer. If the Chief Justice got up at the beginning of this session and said “ All rise for a prayer ”, would you sit down? Do you think -- how many people in this room do you think would sit, talking truthfully? All right. So why do you think that someone who is sitting in a small room where hearings of this nature are being held, when the guy who's about, the chairman of this legislative body, is about to rule on an application you're bringing to him or her, why do you think any of those people wouldn't feel coerced to stand?

2013,Fifth Third Bancorp v. Dudenhoeffer,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"This does -- this plan didn't require you to invest solely in employer stock, did it? It gave you the option to do it and to go above the 10 percent. But it didn't require you to buy only employer stock, did it? Could you point to the part of your plan that did that? Because I looked at it and I didn't see the plan requiring 100 percent investment. You use the word ""primarily"". There's an allegation here that you should have stopped buying stock once you understood that there was a serious condition in the company. That you've breached your duty of loyalty, not of prudence. What do you do with that allegation? It doesn't say you have to. It says ""primarily"". It doesn't say you have to continue buying. So what's wrong with following the law and disclosing that material information to the public and stopping the -- the employees from losing more money in worthless stock-- --or almost worthless stock? That's not an ERISA responsibility. It's an SEC responsibility. It's 10b-5 responsibility. Aren't you supposed to disclose any information that a reasonable investor-- --would real-- --So what's -- what's wrong with a rule that simply says a fiduciary has to do whatever it's -- possible to protect beneficiaries within the bounds of the law? And so if the law required you to disclose it, and you didn't, you've breached your duty of prudence and of loyalty, because you've protected the company-- --but not the beneficiaries. You -- you don't -- you're -- you have an absolute duty to the beneficiary. Let me just continue to Justice Breyer's question. There are some legal duties. I don't know of a trustee who has to break the law. They can't sell on the basis of inside information, and that's a legal prohibition. So your claim rises and falls on the fact that you think they're -- they've breached their duty of loyalty by having the inside information and -- or exactly what is your claim? What could they have done that wouldn't breach the law? How would they-- Mr. Kneedler, a stock drop in and of itself, I don't think, can prove a lack of prudence because-- --You agree with that? Exactly. It's true almost anywhere because you can't outsmart the market. So how do you deal with what has been vexing us, the issue of what a fiduciary should or can do when they are an insider and have only inside information, not public information? So where is the breach of fiduciary duty? Where's the breach of loyalty? What can it consist of, and what does someone have to prove in a complaint? Because this has to do with a pleading presumption and a marriage presumption. I'm sorry. Investigate what, the nonpublic information? Investigate-- I -- I appreciate that. But if I'm listening to the government carefully and understanding its position, it's basically saying if there's been a violation of a securities law that a fiduciary knows, then why shouldn't it be liable both under the company, under 10b-5, and the director of the plan or the trustee of the plan as a breach of loyalty to -- or -- or of prudence to the beneficiaries? It's like -- yes, it's a double remedy, but there's lots of things that provide double remedies. So if that person should have disclosed. Well, it won't as a trustee. It will against the company. Obey the law. I think that that's the simple answer. You know they created the conflicts. I'm not shrugging my shoulder out of lack of sympathy but out of reality. The loyalty is to the beneficiaries. If you're going to place someone there who comes to inside knowledge, you're going to create potentially a problem. But I think your adversary was saying that's a self-induced problem, not one that the law should excuse you from following whatever the law is.

2013,Burrage v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I think this is all being sort of tied up together. I always thought foreseeability and proximate cause were the same. I think the issue doesn't do with either foreseeability, scope of risk, or proximate cause. It has to do with what you started with, which is what's the level of factual causation that we want to set. What definition are we going to give for the legal causation standard. And you're saying that it has to be but-for? All right. Let's assume that we are troubled by the examples that have been given. If two people or three people come together and each puts in a drop of blood, either knowing that only one drop is necessary or that all three drops are necessary, we don't want to let that person off because it doesn't seem logical, okay? What would save your case in it? Is there a different proximate cause standard but not involving but-for that would still get you what you are looking for? And what do we look to if we are not looking to causation? Why does it matter if you know that three people have -- three people hate someone and they are acting independently, each one intended to kill the guy and, you know, that the other two joined in was lovely, but we don't know which drop did it. We don't particularly care, do we? There is no conspiracy. How can we save this case if there is no conspiracy? I'm sorry. Now I'm really confused. I thought you were pointing the causation, the factual causation, into proximate cause. You are saying there's a difference. So what do you think gets folded into proximate cause? In one other case -- there has been one other case, but you are suggesting that there are cases in which there might be a proximate cause problem, you just-- --as you just said to Justice Kennedy.

2013,Kansas v. Cheever,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Can I go back to the line drawing? Can I go back to the line drawing? A question that some of my colleagues have focused on. If we're to say that this was not compelled speech, presumably there'd be no reason the government couldn't use this report, whether or not the defendant put his or her mental state at issue, because if it's not compelled, you could use it as affirmative evidence, correct? Seems a somewhat-- --If I may finish? Assuming that I'm troubled by that holding, then what's the line we draw with respect to the question Justice Kennedy asked you as to when it is permissible. You're saying let's just rule on the base. When the defendant puts on an expert, we can rebut with an expert. But the broader question of if he puts his mental state at issue without an expert, could you do it? Could you still put on his examination? I'm not sure you've really answered that question-- --which is how broadly do we hold. There's a waiver whenever you put in your mental state at issue or is it a waiver only when you use an expert and then the government is free to respond with a compelled statement. Well, I'm presuming that if a defendant takes the stand and says something completely contrary to what he tells a government psychiatrist, that you would rely on the Brown line of cases, that you could cross-examine him on the contrary statement to the psychiatrist. Well, that would be a different issue. I'm just talking about whatever statements he made. But don't -- the light is on.

But if we assume that to be the case, most circuits who have addressed the issue, and I think it may be all of them, have said you can because there's a waiver of your Fourth Amendment right when you take the stand to impeachment.

2013,"Petrella v. MGM, Inc.",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Could you -- do you have to accept Justice Scalia's premise that the Court in all areas is deprived of that right? Can you concentrate on your -- your arguments why in this particular Act, even if we had the option, we shouldn't exercise it? You see, counselor, this is my problem. And -- and I sort of disagree with you fundamentally, because I don't know that you're entitled to injunctive relief, but you might be entitled to a compulsory license. And by that, I mean you have -- this is the government's position, and maybe I'm arguing for it. The government says you might be entitled to payment for the use of your copyright because it belongs to you and there shouldn't be some adverse possession right that the other side gets. But in terms of injunctive relief, given their reliance on your failure to act for 18 years, they shouldn't be put out of business and told that they can't continue in their business. And so that's the kind of policy I'm talking about, which is break down the remedies and tell me -- I'm more moved by the fact that someone could take over your copyright then I am by your injunctive relief argument. Why? You'd be entitled to money for their infringement. 3 years -- you only go back 3 years, but if they continue to infringe in the future, presumably you can get an order giving you damages for that. Counsel, how do you deal with the language in Holmberg, Mack, and Russell? Then you're after -- I've looked at that, not myself, but my law clerk, looked at all of the cases and they are absolutely right that in every case we've applied laches, it's only where there's not been an underlying statute of limitations. And in every case in which there's an underlying statute of limitations, we have said no laches. They lost there. They didn't apply laches there. But the facts didn't support that, meaning that they didn't grant such. It is true, however, that your -- while your -- all of your investment in this is going to be offset against your profits, correct? What's so bad about that? Why should you -- you've gotten a lot of profits in those 18 years and, in fact, at one point when she did reach out to you, you told her, ""Why sue? "" ""You're not going to get any money. "" ""We're not making any. "" Well, if it has not, then we're back to the point I made. Are you disagreeing with the Government's position that the Court has equitable power in injunctive relief to decide how much you paid forward? I don't understand. Why didn't you just go in and get a declaratory judgment when you first heard from her? Counsel, she was going to get this copyright when her father died. Under no circumstance, even if she had sued in '92, could she have brought a claim in the 1960s. She didn't have a copyright then. Your complaint is not against the witness dying. Your complaint is about what Congress does, which is to give a person the right to keep a copyright or renew it when the individual with whom you probably dealt with is dead. That's always going to be the case. That is true about the Ninth Circuit, but between the Second, Sixth, Tenth and Eleventh, I always -- I thought those circuits announced laches are available, but only in an exceptional circumstance. And I actually don't know how many cases they barred suit, copyright suit on, completely on the basis of laches. Just answer. Did you find any case where they actually applied laches? An injunction but not the suit completely? The Ninth Circuit I know-- --How about your creation of another derivative work?

Since when -- I know that there's less emphasis now on the IQ test than there was before. But when the IQ test was used, did they always use it as a fixed number or did they always include the SEM as informing the clinical judgment? Since then they have not changed. That's been the same in all medical diagnosis. They're not arguing for that. They're just arguing that we should stay where it's always been, which is using the SEM. That's why you have the other two prongs. That's why you have the other two prongs. And at every juncture when you have a fixed cutoff, you have the ability to defeat the other two prongs, but you're stopping them on a test based on a test score that has a margin of error recognized by the designers of the test. Of those eight, how many actually have a fixed cutoff and how many have a SEM? I thought it was only four that didn't have consideration. But by judicial decision, they've considered -- well, we -- that -- that's something that-- --Exactly. That's what I'm saying. Only four have it interpreted without the SEM. I thought only four had interpreted without using the SEM? Only four, like Florida.

2013,Rosemond v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Excuse me. But what are we instructing-- --I think what we're driving at here, and I think this is the moment you're resisting, but to me, and as you can tell from my colleague's questions, if you know that someone's carrying a gun, and whether you want them to use it or not is irrelevant, if they take it out and use it and you have gone along with them in the crime, you're guilty. Okay? That -- that's what we're driving at. Assume that I believe that. Assume that I believe that if you have knowledge of the gun, and that I am participating in the crime with your knowledge of that gun, whether the knowledge is secured before the crime starts or during the crime, if I continue to participate in the crime knowing that you have a gun, then that's knowledge of the gun and intent to facilitate. I thought the example that you were relying on here or the issue that got confused in the briefs was whether or not, from the sequence of facts in this case, you can actually discern that intent to facilitate the crime because the alleged shooter, which your client said was someone else, jumped into the car and the car took off before anybody could abandon the crime. That's what I actually thought this case was about: At what juncture do you instruct the jury to say that you have to be a participant with knowledge of the crime? But you're saying something different right now. You're almost suggesting that there has to be a pre-knowledge that the gun will be used. I'm hard to imagine that. Give me an example. What would the instruction look like? To -- to -- what would it look like to capture the difference you're trying to convey? Well, then you come-- --you come up against the government's argument that you don't have to facilitate every element. Could you talk practically about what the difficulties are for the government in this scenario? It's nice to put hypotheticals in where you know, where you say someone knew X, Y and Z. The reality is in most cases you don't. Occasionally you get a co-conspirator that will tell you, but in most cases you have just the actor. A defendant is present during a crime, a gun is pulled, and he leaves with his cohorts. You don't know if he had advance knowledge that the gun would be used because he wasn't carrying it and he may have done nothing but be present during the crime, left, and got a split of the money later, correct? That's your point, right? That's your-- --So isn't this really an argument about how you define facilitation? You are not arguing that -- that some form of participation in the crime with knowledge that the gun is being used is required. You are really arguing about how far the proof has to go. Because your adversary keeps saying mere knowledge of the gun's being used is not enough. What is so hard about saying, did you have knowledge that the gun would be used, either -- and you facilitate -- but you continue to facilitate the crime? --the underlying crime. Knowing that a gun would be used. You had to intentionally participate knowing that a gun would be used.

Mitchell was about sentencing. Nothing -- zero equals zero. And the zero just can't be added onto or taken away from. Zero is zero, not a positive, not a negative.

The question is are they? Is your definition -- I mean, Justice Breyer has already asked you -- said he's troubled about the phonograph store, and -- and the Dropbox and the iCloud. I'm also worried about how to define or -- public performance or the performance of a work publicly, which I guess is the better way to do it, according to you. How do I define that so that someone who sells coaxial cable to a resident of a building is not swept up as a participant in this? Or someone who -- the sort of passive storage advisors that -- this is really hard for me.

Why is it illogical to think that a falsehood rendered through a third party that might affect a bank, a false check, as your client was charged with, that that would be the very case Congress would have wanted covered? What this Court did after the -- after -- or before this statute -- this statute was passed before the Court's interpretation of the mail fraud statute. Every court that had looked at it at the time the statute was passed had determined there were two separate provisions. So why would Congress have any reason to believe they were passing a singular case, a singular charge? What is the thinking of those courts? What's the thinking of those courts? What's the rationale? And the courts don't hold this way, but hold, as the court did below, that it's an intent to deceive anyone so long as the scheme is-- But here the bank is not the victim. That's the whole point.

Mr. Yang, if we are concerned about federalizing every case involving a check, okay, you -- your brief does give us an alternative.

Please answer, how do we get to your reading from the text of the statute. So far I'm with you, but you haven't answered my question. Which part of the statute are you interpreting with this limiting principle, the ‶ obtain ″ part? ‶ By means of ″. I take your point that the words on the page look very good for you.

But I don't understand how, if the falsehood is made to Target, who gives the person the DVD off the shelf, how you prove that that's an intent to defraud the bank as opposed to defraud Target.

2013,Harris v. Quinn,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Is your argument dependent on this being sort of a dual employee situation, that it's reimbursement as opposed to policemen, fire -- police people, fire people, teachers, other public -- other public employees who are directly employed by the State? Did they have that before the union? So let's break this down. You're not arguing that there's something wrong with a union qua union. Is there anything wrong with the State saying, we're not going to negotiate with any employee who's not a member of the union? Is there a problem for the State to say -- the union, to organize, has a certain amount of costs. So putting aside fair representation laws, could the State say, this is what we're going to pay police officers, 100 dollars, but we're going to pay union members 110 to reimburse them for the cost of negotiation. Would that be okay? So there's no problem here with the representation. Your problem is with the fair share? But what stops the non -- the people who oppose the union policy from sending a letter, asking a meeting, expressing their disapproval in any forum they want and in any way they want to whatever policy a union is advocating? Is there anything that stops them from doing that? So where's the First Amendment abridgement? They can do whatever they want. They can speak however they want in support of or in opposition to absolutely anything the union is doing. How about here for your employees? They negotiate health insurance. Do they -- they don't negotiate termination because that's up to the individual-- --parties. So there's no grievance committee. Do they negotiate the tasks that will be reimbursed? All right. So you're being asked to have a fair share of how much you're getting from the State for your services and health insurance. What else is negotiated that you're being asked to pay for? Why? If your adversary says that the reimbursement rate is set by the Medicaid program, so why do you need a union to tell you how much to pay if it's already set? Mr. Smith, I think that there's -- I must say that I might have labored under it. From your adversary's statement, it appears as if there's a belief that the Federal Government sets a fixed amount and that's what the State has to pay. Whether the Federal Government pays you a certain amount, however, you seem to be saying the State can go above that amount if it chooses. That's the cooperative nature of this. Why would anybody join the union under those circumstances or pay enough to support the union efforts? ",be your argument dependent on this be sort of a dual employee situation that it be reimbursement as oppose to policeman fire police people fire people teacher other public other public employee who be directly employ by the state do they have that before the union so let us break this down you be not argue that there be something wrong with a union qua union be there anything wrong with the state say we be not go to negotiate with any employee who be not a member of the union be there a problem for the state to say the union to organize have a certain amount of cost so put aside fair representation law could the state say this be what we be go to pay police officer dollar but we be go to pay union member to reimburse them for the cost of negotiation would that be okay so there be no problem here with the representation your problem be with the fair share but what stop the non the people who oppose the union policy from send a letter ask a meeting express their disapproval in any forum they want and in any way they want to whatever policy a union be advocate be there anything that stop them from do that so where be the first amendment abridgement they can do whatever they want they can speak however they want in support of or in opposition to absolutely anything the union be do how about here for your employee they negotiate health insurance do they they do not negotiate termination because that be up to the individual party so there be no grievance committee do they negotiate the task that will be reimburse all right so you be be ask to have a fair share of how much you be get from the state for your service and health insurance what else be negotiate that you be be ask to pay for why if your adversary say that the reimbursement rate be set by the medicaid program so why do you need a union to tell you how much to pay if it be already set mr smith i think that there be i must say that i might have labor under it from your adversary s statement it appear as if there be a belief that the federal government set a fixed amount and that be what the state have to pay whether the federal government pay you a certain amount however you seem to be say the state can go above that amount if it choose that be the cooperative nature of this why would anybody join the union under those circumstance or pay enough to support the union effort ,187.72000000000003,Roberts Court,"Jan 21, 2014","Pamela Harris, Ellen Bronfeld, Carole Gulo, Michelle Harris, Wendy Partridge, Theresa Riffey, Stephanie Yencer-Price, Susan Watts, and Patricia Withers","Pat Quinn, in his official capacity as governor of the State of Illinois, SEIU Healthcare Illinois & Indiana, SEIU Local 73, and AFSCME Council 31",11-681,"Oct 1, 2013","Jun 30, 2014",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

2013,Lane v. Franks,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"So I think you're -- let's use the quintessential example, police officers or lab technicians. Generally they are called by the prosecutor, but occasionally they are called by defense attorneys. So when are they immunized and when are they not? When are they acting within the scope of their duties and when are they not? So what happens in a situation where a police officer gets on the stand and in testifying honestly admits to corruption, admits to -- or does it in a slovenly way, comes to court dressed in a clown suit? Could the employer fire him then? That means the Eleventh Circuit is wrong. Should the employee be victimized because they were following circuit bad precedent? Whether it's good or bad doesn't matter under our jurisprudence. I go back to my point, which is they got it wrong. But do we expect the employee to know they got it wrong or under what circumstances do we expect them to know? All right. Tell me what you want as your rule. Anyone subpoenaed in a criminal trial is protected? Well, wait a minute. What are you doing about the truth-finding functions of the -- of a trial setting when you're saying or telling people, employees, don't go and tell the truth because if the truth hurts your employer, you're going to be fired? That there's something -- you can be always fired for some other reason that the employer can point to under Pickering or otherwise, but what kind of message are we giving when we're telling employees, you're subpoenaed any reason in a trial, go and tell a falsehood because otherwise you can be fired? You mean the Constitution doesn't protect someone in a trial from telling the truth? That it's not a matter of public concern that an employee tell the truth? Why should it matter then if an employee's job is to investigate corruption? If that's their job and they are called by you to testify at a corruption trial and then they are fired for it, should it really matter that it's part of their job or not? But that seems counterintuitive to me. Why do we let -- why do we put people at risk for telling the truth? To tell the truth about something? And I'm assuming if they lied, they could be fired. But why are we-- --I certainly understand people -- the government being able to tell people don't go out and talk to the newspapers about this, don't go out and talk about X publicly, because we should be able to control those kinds of disclosures. But why are we putting people at risk for doing -- telling fundamental truth in a public forum like a trial? Is Garcetti right on that point as it relates to testimony? That -- that's really the issue that's of public concern. Is Garcetti right? Is the line between it being a part of your duties or not sensical in any way? We've all agreed that getting fired for admitting something, doing it in -- in an improper way, a whole host of things can get you fired. But if someone is called to testify truthfully about a matter of public concern, and they testify that way, should they be able to be fired under the First Amendment?

In White, the -- the tipster gave future predictive information, but all of it was innocent, somebody driving a car and going to a particular place. Now you're asking us to import that wholesale. Why don't we just stick to our general standard, which is the totality of the circumstances, and look at what failure there is in the logic of the California court below. It -- it looked at the quality of the information regarding the vehicle, which is -- a legitimate tipster will tell you what the vehicle looks like and its license plate or enough information so it can be identified. It looked at the caller actually witnessing the event and giving you enough detail to know that it's not a legal conclusion, but an actual event that suggests recklessness. And corroboration of the -- of the details given by the tipster. Isn't that the application of our traditional test? Well, that's just not true in Florida v. J.L. because the individual didn't match the description completely and there were two or three individuals there, not just one. And so -- and there was no predictive or no other detail other than someone in this general area. No reason to believe the caller had personal knowledge. No reason to believe the person had personal knowledge. He didn't say that the gun was pulled on him or that -- or how he saw it or how he knew. So you don't think there's something significant about calling up and saying someone forced me off the road? Is every reckless driving drunk driving? Is every reckless driving drunk driving? How about if somebody just calls and says, X vehicle is driving recklessly, says no more, doesn't describe how, doesn't give you any details as to how they know it. Is that enough for reasonable suspicion? Why? How about speeding? There's plenty of people who speed regularly. Isn't that reckless behavior? So how do you know someone who calls -- my mother, who can't drive above 50, thinks that when I go 51 that I'm speeding and reckless. I'm speeding and reckless. Hensley's victim wasn't a victim; meaning there was -- it was an anonymous tip? Yes, that's what I'm saying. So it wasn't an anonymous tip? It wasn't public safety. It was the report of a crime by a known person. All right. Please define for me what behavior would give police officers or what descriptors would be adequate for the police to think someone's drunk. Swerving, I know, has been mentioned. But reckless driving, there's been a lot of discussion that there could be a wide variety of reckless driving.

2013,Law v. Siegel,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Can we talk about that policy? I mean, it would seem to me that a court's sanctioning power is among one of the most respected and longstanding powers. So putting aside the government's reliance on the statutory scheme, I don't see it. But how about the inherent power? Meaning, you want to read a preclusion of the inherent power out of -- not from an express term, but implicitly. But you are talking about the inherent power. You're saying a court, in its-- --inherent power, can't use that property. That's what you're saying.

Does this power go to invading the other exempt properties, like an IRS?

",why not what would happen under the reasoning of this case what would happen to the decision of recess appoint judge of which there be be quite a few be that day but why you be make an assumption which be that the senate have to take a recess but the senate could choose if it want to and i think there might be some citizen that would encourage it to to never recess and and to work every day which lot of people do so if it mean the same thing then you be tie the two together which actually might have some validity but would not that require the definition of a recess to be a period in which both house have choose to consent to an adjournment can you have an adjournment without a suspension of business be not the two the same but I be talk about tie the two together but that but that assume something which be let us go back to the happening word that be so unambiguous that they know it be unambiguous but year history start with president washington who fill two vacancy that occur before the senate break to every almost every president thereafter have do the same so why should we conclude that today s understanding be the same as the understanding of the found father why do not we take their unbroken practice as give us that definition could you could you tell let us go back to this what be your definition of a recess when the senate actually say we be take a recess whether it get the consent of the house or not do it have to do that by what command do it have to do that yes no sine die or any do it need the consent of the house to do that so so do it have to do that in between the two congressional session mr estrada mr estrada in your early example you say that if the senate decide to recess and the house do not approve that the president can then do it be it your belief that a recess be only something that both house have agree to a break in business that both house have agree to so what do you need why do the president have to adjourn the house in your example if the senate vote tomorrow to recess can the president appoint at least in your view any vacancy that occur during that recess why do you need a date what what in what rule make a recess define as something without date it always have a date because we know january rd be a new session ,171.49,Roberts Court,"Jan 13, 2014",National Labor Relations Board,Noel Canning,12-1281,"Jun 24, 2013","Jun 26, 2014",113.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2013,Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"May I ask-- --Could I ask you a follow-up to Justice Kagan? Now that's a fifth interpretation by your side. That to me is the quintessential ambiguity in a statute where we give deference to the Agency. So if your side can't even come to one interpretation, why shouldn't we defer to the Agency? Well, it hasn't rewritten them. All it has said, as I understand it, and I don't understand -- other than your view that there are too many people it's regulating, is that we can't implement it immediately, because it would overburden us administratively. It hasn't said that over time, with streamlining and with other adjustments, that it can't do this. It's just said we can't do it right away. But I'm -- but I'm a little confused, because there have to be pollutants who -- where it doesn't emit just 250, where it emits a million. And the Best Available Control Technology won't get it down to below 250. Yet the PSD program is in effect when they get down below 250 on any pollutant of the six criteria. So it can't be your view that this statute was written only to -- to get to measurable pollutants that -- that are at 250 or -- or can be brought below 250. That's a minimum, but anything-- --above it. All right. So-- --And so GHG is something that's above that and it's never going to be brought down below it. Right. Well, let's go-- --That's generally because the section that it's in gives a different definition directly. You are right, but-- --You -- just to be clear, your reading would say that the -- that the Agency was not permitted, with notice and opportunity to be heard, to say -- to make a criteria -- make this a criteria of pollution in NAAQS. I don't think that answers the question. I said I don't think -- I don't think it answers the question, which is I know that's the argument; are you saying you can't defend his argument or are you saying that-- Let me ask you a question. Assuming we agree with you, that neither Massachusetts or Alabama -- there's no statutory command to come to EPA's conclusion, what do we do? Do we just reverse them, or do we vacate and remand and tell them, no, you were wrong at step one; there is ambiguity in the statute? Title V is not the PSD requirement. Title V is just the recordkeeping provision. And so why shouldn't we exempt people from Title V? That's not what's causing the burden that you're talking about. It's just a recordkeeping provision. To accept your -- your argument, we have to reverse Massachusetts. Well, you're saying that the -- that Congress didn't intend to control this pollutant. We said there that it did. I'm sorry. I just want to make sure that I understood correctly. Under 7411, you can require a PSD-- --Right. What's the -- I know litigants hate this question. If you were going to lose-- --I just want to be clear. Your reading or -- or your suggested out would mean that -- that only the major facilities as defined now essentially would -- would-- --Well, Justice Breyer said the difference between 83 percent and 86 percent, that 3 percent difference of who you're covering is thousands and thousands of people. Or entities, I should say, not people, of institutions. Is that going to be the same under the reading that you are proposing? So what do I do with the examples in the brief of the 144 permits that have already been given, people who have managed to come into compliance under that?

So they've undone -- they're taking Texas law, if you go under 1404, to Virginia. And that would defeat the purpose of the venue selection to start with. That's part of your argument? But your -- your adversary is not taking that discretion away. It's saying -- your adversary I understand is conceding that Virginia has the ability to apply 1404 in it's judgment, but you should honor the contract. I have one fundamental problem which is slightly different. Under Bremen and Carnival, if the forum selected was arbitration or a State court, then the court has no 1404 power. It must transfer to those venues. If we accept 1404 as applying, then we're disfavoring commercial parties from picking Federal courts because they're going to have to accept that a non-selected venue will have the power to make the decision whether to transfer or not. That seems to me to invite -- there may be people who think that's a good thing, get cases out of the Federal court even if they are international commercial cases. But isn't that what you are inviting? Well-- --You use 12(b)(3), not 1404. In those other cases you-- --you use 12(b)(3). In other words, that issue has not been decided by them. Excuse me. Are you saying that by filing in Texas, you're not going to arbitration? So what's more favorable about Texas other than your convenience?

So they would be -- the only people collecting that $160,000 are going to be the lawyers. [Laughter] You took a contingency case in a contract matter?

2013,"Halliburton Co. v. Erica P. John Fund, Inc.",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"In a class action, how do you prove loss causation without proving price impact? I know that there are some individual cases with individual misrepresentations that have a different form of loss causation. But I'm talking exclusively on a -- in a class. How do you prove loss -- proximate cause or loss causation without proving price impact? Well, that makes no sense. Because if they relied on their statement, then that's -- they have to prove loss causation in the same way that the class does. It's only if they're relying on a separate statement, which isn't part of the class, that would entitle them to a different calculation of loss causation. How? With the same misstatement at issue? I don't see how this is a midpoint. If you're going to require proof of price impact, why not do away with market efficiency? The whole premise of the other economic theory that you rely on is that market efficiency is irrelevant. Some information impacts the market, whether efficient or not, and some doesn't, whether efficient or not. I think that's the basic economic argument the other side's making, correct? So why bother with Basic at all if we're going to do what you're suggesting-- --turn the -- turn the class certification into a full-blown merits hearing on whether loss causation has been proven? Mr. Boies, I don't know that I fully understood your point in your brief as to why proving price impact was so difficult. Is it equal to proving market efficiency? Is it less burdensome, more burdensome? Why can't it be done at the class certification stage? And the question I asked your adversary: If we believe price impact is necessary, why keep Basic if we're going to put it in a class certification? I thought-- --I thought there were two questions, and I don't know that you've really answered the two. I thought your colleague was talking about less than one percent, whatever the figure was, is of cases that were certified as classes, how many go to trial. You said something different, which is that not every class is certified. Do you have a percentage for the amount -- the number -- for that number? Do you know any article that talks about that -- those numbers? So your preference would be to make the plaintiff bear the burden or just for defendants to be able to rebut the price impact-- --at a class certification?

2013,Highmark v. Allcare Management Systems,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"If we undo-- --Mr. Katyal, if we were to overrule the Brooks Furniture standard -- you've just heard the argument where that issue is being presented to us in Octane. If we were to do that, how would that affect this case? Wouldn't it essentially moot the question because you wouldn't have this objective reasonableness test controlling the outcome? So when does that become a pure question of law? Even if I assumed that ultimately the claim that you made might have been -- might have had a basis, like the court below agreed, as I read the District Court's decision, it wasn't basing its decision merely on that. What it was basing it on -- and it goes through a whole laundry list of things that it thought constituted abusive litigation -- very little prefiling investigation, continuous switch of claims because of the lack of that investigation, pursuing a theory that your expert didn't even agree with. That all sounds to me like a factual basis, basically saying this litigation was abusive. And I don't understand how that doesn't feed into the ""objective unreasonableness"". Meaning that if you had done the investigation you should have, you may have had a claim or thought you had a claim, but you would have learned much earlier that even your expert disputed things and you're likely not to have brought the suit. That's how I read the District Court's decision. I'm sorry. I'm -- I'm a little confused. With respect to winning or losing the case, you're going to get de novo review because the Federal Circuit here looked at the claim construction, under de novo review, agreed with the District Court that it had construed the claim properly and that you lost. So you got de novo review. The issue on a reasonable ground to pursue the litigation, whether it was objectively reasonable or not, I think that's Justice Breyer's point, which it generally has factors that are independent of winning or losing, and that's why I kept going back to what the District Court said in this case, which you seem to ignore. It, at one point, recognizes that your claim was a difficult one, but it says that doesn't excuse the fact that you maintained the 52C claim, the one at issue here, even after both the master -- special master and your expert had said a particular claim wasn't sustainable. And it continued with a long example of behavior examples, multiple ones, that it found unreasonable, having nothing to do with the ultimate reasonableness of your last argument before the Appellate Court. So, again, I ask the question: Why should this objective reasonableness be considered a pure question of law? Because it's not about right or wrong and legal answer; it's about behavior during litigation. ",if we undo mr katyal if we we be to overrule the brook furniture standard you have just hear the argument where that issue be be present to us in octane if we we be to do that how would that affect this case would not it essentially moot the question because you would not have this objective reasonableness test control the outcome so when do that become a pure question of law even if i assume that ultimately the claim that you make might have be might have have a basis like the court below agree as i read the district court s decision it be not base its decision merely on that what it be base it on and it go through a whole laundry list of thing that it think constituted abusive litigation very little prefiling investigation continuous switch of claim because of the lack of that investigation pursue a theory that your expert do not even agree with that all sound to me like a factual basis basically say this litigation be abusive and i do not understand how that do not fee into the objective unreasonableness meaning that if you have do the investigation you should have you may have have a claim or thought you have a claim but you would have learn much earlier that even your expert dispute thing and you be likely not to have bring the suit that be how i read the district court s decision I be sorry I be I be a little confused with respect to win or lose the case you be go to get de novo review because the federal circuit here look at the claim construction under de novo review agree with the district court that it have construe the claim properly and that you lose so you get de novo review the issue on a reasonable ground to pursue the litigation whether it be objectively reasonable or not i think that be justice breyer s point which it generally have factor that be independent of win or losing and that be why i keep go back to what the district court say in this case which you seem to ignore it at one point recognize that your claim be a difficult one but it say that do not excuse the fact that you maintain the c claim the one at issue here even after both the master special master and your expert have say a particular claim be not sustainable and it continue with a long example of behavior example multiple one that it find unreasonable have nothing to do with the ultimate reasonableness of your last argument before the appellate court so again i ask the question why should this objective reasonableness be consider a pure question of law because it be not about right or wrong and legal answer it be about behavior during litigation ,233.67,Roberts Court,"Feb 26, 2014","Highmark, Inc.","Allcare Management Systems, Inc.",12-1163,"Oct 1, 2013","Apr 29, 2014",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2013,"Nautilus, Inc. v. Biosig Instruments, Inc.",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I don't think the majority or the -- or the concurrence or the other side disagreed with that. The only question was whether it was part of the specifications or not. I thought that was the only difference between them. They both agreed ultimately that the electrodes had to cancel out -- was it the EMGs? So they both agreed that that was part of the scope. The only issue was, was it part of the specifications or part of the claims. But both of them make up the scope of the patent. What would be the purpose of the invention if it were only covering spacing without the function of canceling the EMG? I can't understand, if I read this patent, what it would do unless you add its function. Did you -- did you proffer any evidence below showing that a person with ordinary skill in the art did not understand what this claim meant? Your brief seems to rely only on the dispute between the majority and the concurrence. But was there -- did you proffer any evidence below? Now, I have a really big problem, which is we as Justices disagree on the meaning of things all the time, and one side will say, this is perfectly clear from the text of the statute, from its -- from its history, from its context. And we do all the statutory tools, and there will be one or more of us who will come out and say, no, we think it's a different interpretation. Would we have any valid patents in the world if that's the standard that we -- that we adopt? That if any judge on a panel thinks that there's another interpretation, that that's sufficient to invalidate a patent as indefinite? But the majority -- but the majority here said that it was clear from the prosecution history, the specifications, and the description that this was definite. I don't know on what basis I would have to overturn their review of that issue. There is a subtle -- no, there is, if you read that language carefully. It seems to be saying that what has to be reasonably definite is the court's construction, and it takes the emphasis away from whether a skilled -- someone skilled in the art would be definite. There is a big difference between can I read this and give it a construction and whether or not a construction is definite enough so someone skilled in the art could understand it. That's my problem with the Federal Circuit's articulation and as you read its decisions. Its focus is not always on that question. Its focus seems to be on the reasonableness of its construction, as opposed to the reasonableness of a skilled artisan's or whether skilled, someone skilled in the art could reasonably construe the scope of this patent. So what do you see as the difference? He says that the concurrence's definition is different from the majority's. The government -- explain -- I read your brief. I know what you think the difference is, but-- --He says there is a difference in scope, so address that. Why don't you see that as being a difference of importance? Why are you -- why are you running from -- the working here is that it cancels out a signal, correct? And so what the majority said is that that function is part of the understanding of the spacing. Isn't that what the majority said? So I don't know whether it has to be equal spacing or one could be one inch and the other half an inch apart. The bottom line is that to work, it has to cancel out, that that's part of the scope. Now, the concurrence said, no, you don't have -- you can't -- I'm not looking at the specification. I think it's definite without it. All right. I don't see how it could be. That's what I think Justice Scalia is saying and Justice Breyer is saying, that if we don't understand what the purpose is, how can that spacing be definite enough to make this thing work. So tell us why you think that the concurrence's interpretation is wrong. What's he missing? Mm-hmm. Result that the specification-- --Do you agree with your adversary that the prosecution history is that at the time the patent was issued and not on re-examination or anything else subsequent? No, no. I didn't ask that question. Explain that. Because he says, and it seems logical, that you're going to stifle inventiveness if people can't, once the patent is issued, know how to get around it. The Federal Circuit seems to say that if there's two reasonable constructions and one would make the patent valid, I think this goes to Justice Kennedy's question, that they're obligated to pick the one that makes the patent valid. Uh-huh. Is that right? So they're wrong in that as well.

Every one of them is based on comparing the testimony to other factors; to logic, to evidence, to objectives. So I don't know what rule it is, what objective evidence means. Do you mean corroboration the way you need to prove a murder? Is that what you want us to announce? It said it, but it didn't do it. Well, counselor, that's what juries do all the time, selectivity. That doesn't move me. What I want to know is: Why do we announce a rule that somehow suggests a limitation that can't exist? Meaning what judges look to, to determine credibility relies on factors that you can't sum up in one word. Every court says that. But isn't that -- I mean, the court didn't say that the court -- that the court below -- the Sixth Circuit didn't say that the court below had to accept the reoffered plea agreement. It seemed inherent in Lafler and Frye that what the court was saying is that the court below has to use its judgment on whether offer -- accepting the plea is -- is right or giving another remedy is right. All of these arguments should be before that court, not before us, as an absolute rule. So that's your only point, which is that that should be an issue for the court below. But some remedy has to be offered-- --if there is a violation. I agree with you and so does your adversary, but he says there is nothing in this record to show what research was done or not done. The fact that the prior counsel's record wasn't reviewed doesn't say that he didn't talk to the prosecutor, doesn't say that he didn't look into other record evidence, any of the discovery that had been filed with the court, or any of the other circumstances that could have informed him adequately. Well, that's-- --Ms. Newman, you know, I -- I'm -- this may be the first case that I have been involved in as a judge -- and there might be others, but myself personally -- where, in a situation like this, the defendant has not put in an affidavit to explain what happened. There is some force to your adversary's argument that there's a really sparse record here. And AEDPA deference requires the burden on you. You can't deny that. I guess -- I don't know if you were responsible, but what other circumstances that would occasion a defendant not saying, this is what I was told? But they didn't ask for the hearing in the court below. They only asked for it at the court of appeals. I -- I-- --I -- I don't understand what you're saying. The other side says, and I think it's the standard, that you look at the totality of the circumstances. And what you're saying is they didn't do that here. It's not that -- they use some objective evidence, you're saying they didn't use other objective evidence. I am-- ",counsel year ago one of my colleague not on this bench but a different one say to me you know there be much to do about judge base credibility on demeanor and he say no one do that what you base it on be the internal consistency and logic of the testimony and how it be corroborate by circumstance and he say otherwise you just rarely hear anybody say story make sense nothing story do not make sense the story s not corroborate but the guy look like he be tell the truth I be read all the decision that you cite for me and not one include in this circuit rely simply on that kind of statement every one of them be base on compare the testimony to other factor to logic to evidence to objective so i do not know what rule it be what objective evidence mean do you mean corroboration the way you need to prove a murder be that what you want us to announce it say it but it do not do it well counselor that be what jury do all the time selectivity that do not move me what i want to know be why do we announce a rule that somehow suggest a limitation that can not exist mean what judge look to to determine credibility relies on factor that you can not sum up in one word every court say that but be not that i mean the court do not say that the court that the court below the sixth circuit do not say that the court below have to accept the reoffered plea agreement it seem inherent in lafler and frye that what the court be say be that the court below have to use its judgment on whether offer accept the plea be be right or give another remedy be right all of these argument should be before that court not before us as an absolute rule so that be your only point which be that that should be an issue for the court below but some remedy have to be offer if there be a violation i agree with you and so do your adversary but he say there be nothing in this record to show what research be do or not do the fact that the prior counsel s record be not review do not say that he do not talk to the prosecutor do not say that he do not look into other record evidence any of the discovery that have be file with the court or any of the other circumstance that could have inform him adequately well that be ms newman you know i I be this may be the first case that i have be involve in as a judge and there might be others but myself personally where in a situation like this the defendant have not put in an affidavit to explain what happen there be some force to your adversary s argument that there be a really sparse record here and aedpa deference require the burden on you you can not deny that i guess i do not know if you we be responsible but what other circumstance that would occasion a defendant not say this be what i be tell but they do not ask for the hearing in the court below they only ask for it at the court of appeal i i i i do not understand what you be say the other side say and i think it be the standard that you look at the totality of the circumstance and what you be say be they do not do that here it be not that they use some objective evidence you be say they do not use other objective evidence i be ,241.24000000000007,Roberts Court,"Oct 8, 2013","Sherry L.

2013,United States v. Castleman,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I -- I'm a little bit concerned about going to that common law meaning. Why don't you go to what the common law meaning of domestic violence is? I thought that was your strongest argument. Because isn't that different than just violence? Exactly. Misdemeanor domestic violence. How about pinching or biting, hair pulling, shoving, grabbing, hitting, slapping; would those be violence or would they be domestic violence if you are doing it against a spouse? Would they in all situations be violence? Not violent force. The statutory term is physical force. Johnson relied on a number of things, but the two were the use of felony and the use of the word ‶ violent force ″, which is not what this statute does. It just -- it uses a common law term, the use of physical force. That's why you are asking us to import the common law in this context. You're asking us to use the terms in their common law sense because of the nature of this -- of this provision. You're suggesting that you can commit a crime of violence because you have to use violent force. You could commit it simply by using an automatic weapon that requires no force to pull the trigger. You're suggesting poisoning isn't covered. You're suggesting that anything -- that the force has to be how we defined it in Johnson, which is a given. But when the misdemeanor -- when the -- when the State -- when this exemption uses the words or this requirement uses the word ‶ misdemeanor domestic violence ″, why should we stray from the common law there? It certainly causes injury. Pushing someone lightly over a cliff causes a lot of injury. Do you seriously think that Congress didn't intend to include that common law meaning of the use of force in their definition of a misdemeanor for domestic violence? Can you give me an example of that? I mean, I think most statutes I know just say causing physical injury. It doesn't say any level of pain. It says any level of physical injury. So assume physical injury has been caused. We can argue on the margins of what -- what qualifies as physical injury. But assuming somebody, like here, pled guilty to it, we know something happened that was physical injury. So assume that. You think causing the pain was intentional there? And you don't think that if -- have you ever had soap in your eye, that somebody threw the soap in to cause you pain intentionally? That wouldn't be physical injury to you?

2013,"Mississippi, ex rel. Hood v. AU Optronics Corp.",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Let's assume a case where -- forget about that the consumer action was settled. And let's forget about a case in which the damages are difficult to prove. Let's think of a case in which the damages can be determined, and the State comes in on behalf of a class of consumers and says we're seeking their restitution. Does your argument change if the facts are different? So is this a real party in interest argument, or is it a statutory argument that-- --the statute requires named plaintiffs as opposed to -- named or unnamed plaintiffs, but plaintiffs. So how do you remand a case when it involves unnamed plaintiffs? Not a proposed class, because you -- if you have a proposed class, that could be persons, and you could identify those. But under your theory, what does a court do to figure out which of all of those unnamed people have claims above or below $75,000? You know, this language is very reminiscent in what's in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 20, the joinder rule. And if I look at the joinder rule, it uses “ persons ” and “ plaintiffs ” essentially in the same way. It's talking about persons being proposed plaintiffs as opposed to unnamed people-- --or the proposed class in essence. It seems that that would be hard, to invoke that case when a statute commands differently. In that case, it's in the -- in the absence of statutory language that requires remand. I -- I'm hard-pressed to think that we can be exercising supplemental jurisdiction in a case where Congress has expressly spoken and said you can't or shouldn't. But that would have required this Court-- --But doesn't your proposal mean that before someone can remove, they have to decide whether the class is certifiable? Because you're not going to decide whether these plaintiffs are actually going to be plaintiffs and part of this class until you decide the class question. If you use the word “ persons ” and you use the language of the statute, it's the class that's being proposed. It's the named plaintiffs and the class that's being proposed of persons that are being proposed to be tried together. But that has to go with the facts of this case. Don't go with the facts.

2013,Fernandez v. California,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Finish. What do you make of the language in Randolph about pretext? Yes. Does it help you in any way? Sure. Because all they have to do is arrest and remove people. So what's left of Randolph if we accept your -- all the police have to do is arrest anyone if they have probable cause, and if they don't, all they have to do is remove them from the premises and just talk to the co-tenant even though they've heard an objection? When is Randolph ever going to survive after this, assuming we accept your argument? So there's nothing left to Randolph. The police just remove the person. Remove them to the stoop, into the police car, to the station? How far before Randolph dies? Did Matlock -- there was no objecting defendant. It's the presumption that still survived, that absent an objection you have a consent, you assume whoever has control over the premises has consented. That's a different situation. That's not Matlock. Matlock doesn't control here. I'm -- I'm a little confused. I thought that when the cotenants gave permission to search, that gave permission to open anything in the premises, to search the entire premises. You're talking about a locked closet or a locked box. Why would it-- --I own the house. I'm letting the person use it by sufferance, not by -- but it's still my closet. I would certainly recommend to every married couple now to have a prenuptial agreement on access rights. [Laughter] Why did they need to search? Why did they need to search? I mean, to look around the house, yes, but if this is a search only for purposes of domestic violence what in her story made them think there was evidence anywhere that was locked up that had -- that there had been any time to lock it up or dispose of it? I think this was just a pure: We want to -- we want to find something else. So they were looking for evidence not on the ground that they arrested him on, but on an independent crime? Did they have probable cause to get a warrant? Once he was identified, did they have probable cause to get a warrant? How about a clear answer? Get a warrant. Get a -- when you have probable cause to believe a crime has been committed, and here clearly you admit there would have been probable cause to search, there's no exigency, there's no looking for evidence related to the crime that drew you particularly there, the screaming, but you've just got to secure the premises and get a warrant.

2013,Environmental Protection Agency v. EME Homer City Generation,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Stewart, below, the government conceded that there was a theoretical possibility that some States could be overcontrolled, that they would be implementing measures that would reduce their contributions to pollution below the 1 percent. Assume that -- I think there's a theoretical possibility of that -- but that your approach was basically fine. What would we do about that? First of all, are there measures States can take to get out of the FIP if it's inappropriate to them because of overcontrol? And if not -- and how do they do it? I mean, what's the process? If we think there's a flaw, do we vacate the rule? Do we leave it in place? What do we do? And what -- and what's our power to do it? If we were to rule against you and affirm the decision below, how long do you think it would take to get a new rule in place? But you're not prevented from giving a counter SIP is what they were being told. You can -- you can counter, is what the government is saying, and so it's not clear to me that they've estopped you from doing your own SIP. So what's the difference? If you think they're wrong, you give a counter-SIP and you duke it out with them in terms of what you think -- where you think they are wrong as applied to you. But let me ask you something fundamental about this. Are you challenging the Transport Rule using cost or are you just challenging the process in which that was achieved? Because if I understand all the amici briefs and the theory of this, not even you would want a command-and-control regulation; is that correct? It'd be crazy if they didn't, right? Right. And for some of them, it would really be a bad idea, wouldn't it? But they were doing that with respect to the NAAQS. I thought that was them saying they had to quantify the NAAQS. Haven't some States already challenged that? Isn't that pending below? Why should we be looking at that issue here when States have challenged that? I don't know why the rest didn't, but three of them have. So why should we enter the fray anticipatorily? Isn't that an issue we should wait and see what EPA says below? No, no, no. This is a very discrete question, that they've already approved some SIPs. Three States have already challenged the fact that they shouldn't be required to meet a new standard because they've already had an old standard approved. That seems to me a very discrete challenge, and three States have undertaken it. Well, I don't know why, but that's a different issue. Even though it has, wouldn't it be more prudent for us to wait for that administrative process to finish before we venture into this question? That's my -- my point. Isn't that the issue that the three States are challenging below, just that discrete issue about whether the EPA can call this a corrective action or not? Isn't that entire issue being determined in those proceedings? But this issue is what's at issue there, part of the-- Do you battle Mr. Stewart's point that Congress surely didn't intend to shut down these plants if they didn't or couldn't feasibly reduce their contributions? So if they couldn't feasibly do it, doesn't the words ‶ significantly contribute ″ have to take into account in some way the cost of reducing the amount? Well, they found a way to do that with the cost tradeoff with the cap and trade system-- --because the industry itself can make that choice, with the State presumably. They're not stopping a SIP that stops a State from participating. They say that's not a theoretical possibility under the numbers they've worked out. So why isn't this taken care of in the process that permits individual States to challenge this as applied?

2013,Unite Here Local 355 v. Mulhall,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"So why isn't that the property that Justice Kennedy referred to? They -- the union paid $100,000 to get the items that the employer gave them. So aren't they valued, something tangible, valued for what the union paid for it? But why? Well, the -- the argument that Justice Scalia and Kennedy are referring to it, is that the employer paid with the employee list, the access to the facility, the promises not to strike to get the 100,000. I think that is the essence of -- because the union paying money is not a violation of the Act. Right. Counsel, it's clear that there's some difficulty in defining the limits of property. There are some things that I think have value even though they may not have market value. For example, an employer bribing a union steward by offering him a favorable work schedule or -- or days off that are a weekend or something that's valuable to the worker but doesn't necessarily have an objective value. The government cites Credit Suisse v. Billing in its brief. When you get up on rebuttal, I want to talk to you about the -- the law that has developed in that case and why it doesn't apply here. Isn't Billing your best argument, the framework of Billing? Some people have suggested that Billings is limited to the antitrust area. And how do you respond to that belief and -- and how do you convince us to expand the doctrine outside its traditional context? Counsel, why don't -- why doesn't the Billings -- Billing framework apply beautifully here? What it holds is that where there's a regulatory framework, and here there is, that produces standards of conduct, going to Justice Kagan's point, that almost all of the three things that you're arguing against are standards of conduct that have been approved by -- have been approved by the government, and when those conflict with the separate Federal statute, then they are implicitly preempted, essentially. Why doesn't that doctrine do the work here? But we have conflicting provisions within standard statutes anyway, so why doesn't the concept behind it still apply? You would argue that the three items in dispute -- the access to property, etc. --that the consideration is the agreement to go into arbitration, first of all, putting aside the hundred thousand dollars. The arbitration of disputes that was promised by the employer and the union under this agreement. Not to strike. Mr. McCracken-- --If I understood the circuit below, it was suggesting, like the government, that an exchange of agreements for purposes of peaceful recognition, terms that were given for that purpose were legal, but that things given for -- that were not solely for recognition, had value outside of that, like money, would be wrong. That 100,000 is troubling to me because I think what the circuit was saying is if the 100,000 bought the peaceful recognition provisions, then that's corrupt, and that is outside the exemptions that the law provides. That's how I read its decision. Tell me why I'm wrong about that and tell me how I deal with that niggling problem I have about the $100,000, because it does feel like a bribe to the employer. I don't think it -- it was puzzled by the provisions at issue. I think it was puzzled by the 100,000. ",so why be not that the property that justice kennedy refer to they the union pay to get the item that the employer give them so be not they value something tangible value for what the union pay for it but why well the the argument that justice scalia and kennedy be refer to it be that the employer pay with the employee list the access to the facility the promise not to strike to get the i think that be the essence of because the union pay money be not a violation of the act right counsel it be clear that there be some difficulty in define the limit of property there be some thing that i think have value even though they may not have market value for example an employer bribe a union steward by offer him a favorable work schedule or or day off that be a weekend or something that be valuable to the worker but do not necessarily have an objective value the government cite credit suisse v billing in its brief when you get up on rebuttal i want to talk to you about the the law that have develop in that case and why it do not apply here be not bill your best argument the framework of billing some people have suggest that billing be limit to the antitrust area and how do you respond to that belief and and how do you convince us to expand the doctrine outside its traditional context counsel why do not why do not the billing bill framework apply beautifully here what it hold be that where there be a regulatory framework and here there be that produce standard of conduct go to justice kagan s point that almost all of the three thing that you be argue against be standard of conduct that have be approve by have be approve by the government and when those conflict with the separate federal statute then they be implicitly preempt essentially why do not that doctrine do the work here but we have conflict provision within standard statute anyway so why do not the concept behind it still apply you would argue that the three item in dispute the access to property etc that the consideration be the agreement to go into arbitration first of all put aside the hundred thousand dollar the arbitration of dispute that be promise by the employer and the union under this agreement not to strike mr mccracken if i understand the circuit below it be suggest like the government that an exchange of agreement for purpose of peaceful recognition term that we be give for that purpose we be legal but that thing give for that we be not solely for recognition have value outside of that like money would be wrong that be trouble to me because i think what the circuit be say be if the buy the peaceful recognition provision then that be corrupt and that be outside the exemption that the law provide that be how i read its decision tell me why I be wrong about that and tell me how i deal with that niggle problem i have about the because it do feel like a bribe to the employer i do not think it it be puzzle by the provision at issue i think it be puzzle by the ,265.57,Roberts Court,"Nov 13, 2013",Unite Here Local 355,"Martin Mulhall, et al.",12-99,"Jun 24, 2013","Dec 10, 2013",113.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1

It gives you more time, but it doesn't take time away from you. You say you have three years, no matter what. From the first date, you have three years. If you need more time, you have a potential out. Counsel, if we rule in your favor -- I'm sorry, against you -- and just say the plans can do this, do you see any reason why the government couldn't pass a regulation saying you've got to give people at least a year from the end of the administrative process to file? I'm going to ask them that question. But are you aware of anything that would stop them from doing that? If we rule in your favor, however, they would be estopped from passing a regulation requiring something different than what we say, correct? Counsel, I could be more troubled by this case if the proof of loss provision required a suit to be brought in a year, because as I'm adding up the timeframe, it's about 15 months if no exceptions remain for the administrative process. Could you answer my question on whether you see any impediment if we rule against you in this case, to the department saying something like, you've got to give at least a year, from the finality of the administrative process? Could you pass such a regulation later? Well, what would your argument be if -- if this -- if ERISA said there is a minimum 3-year statute of limitations? Would your argument be identical today or would that be a clearer demonstration that Congress intended that the background principle that that starts from, the exhaustion of administrative process, be incorporated? So do you require an explicit agreement that the start is going to be different as well? That you can shorten or lengthen a limitations period, but this is not about shortening or lengthening a limitations period. This is about changing a start time for the limitations period. Do you require something explicit -- an explicit statement as to that as well? Right. So you think Congress would only legislate in that way. You think Congress would only legislate that way. Do you have any examples of that, of Congress saying the limitations period starts at the end of the administrative process and is for 3 years or 1 year? That's much better. What case is that? ",I be sorry i think the court below say that that be irrelevant to the resolution of this case that even if they accept your date for when the proof of loss start that you would still lose I be a little confused because it would be the same no matter what rule we institute meaning you would never know when the administrative you really never know when the administration process be final just like you be argue you do not know when the proof of loss date be final but at least the advantage of proof of loss you know you get three year from at least the beginning of the process that can only help you it give you more time but it do not take time away from you you say you have three year no matter what from the first date you have three year if you need more time you have a potential out counsel if we rule in your favor I be sorry against you and just say the plan can do this do you see any reason why the government could not pass a regulation say you have get to give people at least a year from the end of the administrative process to file I be go to ask them that question but be you aware of anything that would stop them from do that if we rule in your favor however they would be estopped from pass a regulation require something different than what we say correct counsel i could be more troubled by this case if the proof of loss provision require a suit to be bring in a year because as I be add up the timeframe it be about month if no exception remain for the administrative process could you answer my question on whether you see any impediment if we rule against you in this case to the department say something like you have get to give at least a year from the finality of the administrative process could you pass such a regulation later well what would your argument be if if this if erisa say there be a minimum year statute of limitation would your argument be identical today or would that be a clear demonstration that congress intend that the background principle that that start from the exhaustion of administrative process be incorporate so do you require an explicit agreement that the start be go to be different as well that you can shorten or lengthen a limitation period but this be not about shorten or lengthen a limitation period this be about change a start time for the limitation period do you require something explicit an explicit statement as to that as well right so you think congress would only legislate in that way you think congress would only legislate that way do you have any example of that of congress say the limitation period start at the end of the administrative process and be for year or year that be much well what case be that ,189.53,Roberts Court,"Oct 15, 2013",Julie Heimeshoff,Hartford Life & Accident Insurance Co. and Walmart Stores,12-729,"Apr 15, 2013","Dec 16, 2013",113.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2013,"Pom Wonderful, LLC v. The Coca-Cola Company",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"If there is no private cause of action to enforce the FDA label standards, only the FDA can bring a proceeding to say that an ad violates its regulations, how does a Court below, without interpreting the regulations, go about deciding whether or not a particular ad doesn't comport with the regulations and hence would be subject to the Lanham Act? Maybe that's a better question for the SG, but I'm trying to figure out-- Excuse me. I'm not sure that -- I mean, the argument is you can't even taste these flavors. That's their point. And you are taking a contrary point, that the flavor doesn't mean what you taste, flavor means something else. Then, Ms. Sherry, you -- the government is taking the position that it's okay for District Courts to determine whether labels, in fact, comply or don't comply with FDA regulations? And if they decide they don't comply, that's when they can could permit a Lanham Act claim? Well, let's -- let's assume the following. The FDA just wanted to know what the name should be. That's all they are regulating. That's the only requirement. And it's not even a requirement. It's an authorization. And that's where I'm having a little bit of difficulty, because it's not that you have to use this name, you're permitted to use this name under their regulations. But why are you permitted to use it in a misleading way? That's really the -- I think the government's position, which is, if you're using the name in combination with other factors in a misleading way that's not a subject to the regulation, just the name, then it's actionable under the Lanham Act. Could the government -- I think what the government is saying nothing about our permission goes to the size of the name on the label-- --that you can break up the name of the juice into two different sizes so that you are deemphasizing it. It also says that the vignette is misleading because it shows products that have potentially nothing in their regulations say anything about the -- and how they display them. It's -- nothing in the regulations talk about using purple instead of whatever that color is that the juice is, that blue, purple, whatever, instead of the color of apple juice. If you use the color of apple juice and grapes, it would be a white color. You basically are talking about field preemption. How do we square this with Wyeth? Wyeth, the FDA actually approves, looks at the label and says, this one is okay. Not only is it not misleading, but it complies with all health requirements, and because the producers of drugs have the ability to change the label without FDA approval, there was -- we found no preemptions and no impossibility. How is Wyeth any different? The FDA here -- it's even worse, this case. The FDA doesn't approve the labels. It never looks at them and says they are okay or not okay unless they decide to enforce the statute. How is this better than Wyeth? You assume people would pick a label and stick with it. The Lanham Act would -- if a Lanham Act claim is bought, and it's upheld, you change the label nationally. ",if there be no private because of action to enforce the fda label standard only the fda can bring a proceeding to say that an ad violate its regulation how do a court below without interpret the regulation go about decide whether or not a particular ad do not comport with the regulation and hence would be subject to the lanham act maybe that be a good question for the sg but I be try to figure out excuse me I be not sure that i mean the argument be you can not even taste these flavor that be their point and you be take a contrary point that the flavor do not mean what you taste flavor mean something else then ms sherry you the government be take the position that it be okay for district court to determine whether label in fact comply or do not comply with fda regulation and if they decide they do not comply that be when they can could permit a lanham act claim well let us let us assume the following the fda just want to know what the name should be that be all they be regulate that be the only requirement and it be not even a requirement it be an authorization and that be where I be have a little bit of difficulty because it be not that you have to use this name you be permit to use this name under their regulation but why be you permit to use it in a misleading way that be really the i think the government s position which be if you be use the name in combination with other factor in a misleading way that be not a subject to the regulation just the name then it be actionable under the lanham act could the government i think what the government be say nothing about our permission go to the size of the name on the label that you can break up the name of the juice into two different size so that you be deemphasizing it it also say that the vignette be mislead because it show product that have potentially nothing in their regulation say anything about the and how they display them it be nothing in the regulation talk about use purple instead of whatever that color be that the juice be that blue purple whatever instead of the color of apple juice if you use the color of apple juice and grape it would be a white color you basically be talk about field preemption how do we square this with wyeth wyeth the fda actually approve look at the label and say this one be okay not only be it not mislead but it comply with all health requirement and because the producer of drug have the ability to change the label without fda approval there be we find no preemption and no impossibility how be wyeth any different the fda here it be even bad this case the fda do not approve the label it never look at them and say they be okay or not okay unless they decide to enforce the statute how be this good than wyeth you assume people would pick a label and stick with it the lanham act would if a lanham act claim be buy and it be upheld you change the label nationally ,224.6,Roberts Court,"Apr 21, 2014","Pom Wonderful, LLC",The Coca-Cola Company,12-761,"Jan 10, 2014","Jun 12, 2014",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2013,Riley v. California,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Fisher, would you -- an earlier question, you didn't finish the answer. You were describing a difference between the downloading by police into databases that they keep forever. What happens with materials that are returned pursuant to a search warrant? Are they precluded from doing that? I wasn't sure I understood your-- --I'm sorry. I don't know that you've answered my question. Which -- can they do the same thing once a search warrant is-- --Frankly, I have to tell you, I don't ever remember a prosecutor coming to me with that kind of delineation. Counsel, in one of our Court decisions in the past, a series of justices asked -- or noted that many of our rules were based on practical considerations. Practically speaking, a person can only carry so much on their person. That is different because carrying a billfold of photographs is a billfold of photographs. It's, you know, anywhere from one to five generally and not much more. But now we're talking about potentially thousands, because with digital cameras people take endless photos and it spans their entire life. You don't see a difference between the two things? What -- what has now become impractical. A GPS can follow people in a way that prior following by police officers in cars didn't permit. By the way-- --I would assume you need to operate the phone to set off the bomb, so that once the police have the phone the bomb is not going to be set off. Could I just ask you-- --Could I ask you a question about the extent of your theory? We're talking about smartphones, which are minicomputers. But your theory would apply to iPads, computers, anything that's, for example, sitting next to a person in a car, at their desk if they are arrested at their desk, anywhere if they are carrying it in their hand because you see a lot of people carrying the iPad or something comparable, a tablet of some sort. Your theory would permit a search of all of those things. How about putting -- let me stop you, because you were making that argument in your brief, and I have three related questions. Okay? Why can't you just put the phone on airplane mode? Yes. You're -- you're confusing me, because if you haven't searched on the scene, then the wipe is going to happen. If you've had enough time at the precinct to put it on airplane mode, the wipe hasn't happened. I'm a little confused about what this argument is. Either you do it at the scene and you protect the phone-- --or you do at the station, and you have enough time to get the warrant by putting it on airplane mode. I don't disagree. Put it on airplane mode. I -- I don't disagree with you, but you're asking us for constitutional principle based on technology that might or might not do something in one or more cases, but not in the general-- I'm not -- I'm not so sure. If he was at the precinct, they could have gotten a warrant, and once he lied about his arrest, they would have known he wasn't living there and would have gotten a warrant. Please tell me about encryption, because I know people can encrypt, but I thought they had to do that when they put the information in the phone. I'm not sure how on the scene the police are going to look at everything in a cell phone anyway. They've got to be doing something to save it. If the encryption can be-- --But you have to keep the phone going anyway till you can get to a place where you do something with it. Once we put in that limit, you'll just download the phone at the station and everything, their medical records, their tax returns, even when they're not relevant to the crime, will be part of your database. Your brief suggested a limitation with respect to access to the iCloud. Could you tell me how you tell the difference? How do you stop it from going off? How about a plain view analysis? Turn on the phone, see if there's been a telephone call within a reasonable amount of time of the arrest or -- or any message that was sent at the time of arrest. That's sort of a plain view situation. It would take care of your person with the picture of him or herself with guns. It would take care of the call to the confederate. It would take care of the -- of the imminent destruction of the phone. Under what theory? I don't disagree with you. I just want to know what would be your theory, and what's the limitation? I was thinking in terms of reasonable expectation of privacy. Most people don't pick up other people's phones to answer them unless the phone is lost. And then you pray the person who found it answers it. [Laughter] Are -- are you -- I -- I -- I'm assuming that what you're saying -- you just said it a minute ago -- the Fourth Amendment, the searches incident to arrest are an exception to the Fourth Amendment? And is it your position, I -- I'm assuming this is what this argument's been about, which is whether we're going to extend that exception of -- the exception of searches incident to arrest to a new category, cell phones-- --which are different than the traditional item. Unless the exceptions have swallowed the rule. This is a very big confusion of the Fourth Amendment. The Fourth Amendment doesn't permit reasonable searches without a warrant. It says you need a warrant for -- we've created exceptions to that, but not because a search is reasonable. Virtually every search could be reasonable without a warrant. If you've watched somebody selling drugs, it's very reasonable to go into their house, but absent the exigent circumstance of the drugs disappearing, you can't.

It would be deeply ironic that we have expended so much energy criticizing Syria, when if this Court were now to declare that our joining or creating legislation to implement the treaty was unconstitutional. We're putting aside the impact that we could have on foreign relations. Why is it, if it's okay to regulate the possession of marijuana, a purely local crime, why is it unconstitutional to regulate the use of something that can kill or maim another human being?

Answer him, and then-- --That is strange because I look at (h)(3), which talks about automatic conversion of battered spouses, of widowed spouses, and I think under your reading, you're basically saying Congress was not intending to let those people jump the line.

That they -- that they were entitled to the same benefits of automatic conversion as (h)(3). So you can have automatic-- --You can have automatic conversion only in the situations that give you other -- other statutes. Is that for F2A children as well? These steps, are they applied to F2A? Not derivatives. I'm talking about the children of spouses. Everything happens at visa issuance moment? Direct or derivative? What he's saying -- but what he's saying is that's true of everybody.

2013,Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Is your claim limited to sensitive materials like contraceptives or does it include items like blood transfusion, vaccines? For some religions, products made of pork? Is any claim under your theory that has a religious basis, could an employer preclude the use of those items as well? How does a corporation exercise religion? I mean, I know how it speaks and we have, according to our jurisprudence, 200 years of corporations speaking in its own interests. But where are the cases that show that a corporation exercises religion? Well, but they were really arguing about things that affected their membership, not them as a corporate entity. So the dissent in this case, in the Tenth Circuit case, said how do we determine when a corporation has that belief? Who says it? The majority of shareholders? The corporate officers? The -- is it 51 percent? What happens to the minority? And how much of the business has to be dedicated to religion? 5 percent? 10 percent? 90 percent? Just assume not a business like yours -- you picked great plaintiffs, but let's assume ---- [Laughter] Let's assume just a business that sells 5 percent of religious books, doesn't play Christmas music, doesn't give off -- works on Sunday, you know, does nothing else religiously. That's the most dangerous piece. That's the one we've resisted in all our exercise jurisprudence, to measure the depth of someone's religious beliefs. I thought more importantly was whether a burden was substantial or not. That we've never acceded to the person claiming a religious exemption, a belief in how substantial the burden might be. Is there -- is there a different way of looking at it, the leeway? In U.S. v. Lee, we said, ""When followers of a particular sect enter into a commercial activity as a matter of choice, the limits they accept on their own conduct as a matter of conscience and faith are not to be superimposed on the statutory schemes which are binding on others in that activity. "" So isn't that really the answer, that we've never considered a for-profit corporation as exercising religion? Well, that's an interesting question, because the briefs on both sides here are written as if the penalty for not having a health insurance policy that covers contraceptives is at issue. But isn't there another choice nobody talks about, which is paying the tax, which is a lot less than a penalty and a lot less than -- than the cost of health insurance at all? These employers could choose not to give health insurance and pay not that high a penalty -- not that high a tax. Well, if they want to do that, they can just pay a greater salary and let the employees go in on the exchange. It's not called a penalty. It's called a tax. And it's calibrated -- and it's calibrated-- --May I just put a footnote on this. I thought the average price of providing insurance for a single person is $4,000, and it's $12,000 for a family -- for a family. So the 2,000 tax -- that's what it's called -- is to help the government provide subsidies to people on the exchange that don't have employer insurance. So it's a tax because it's -- it is to do exactly what your client wants, to get the government to supply the contraceptives, not the insurance companies. Counsel, your attorney -- one of the attorneys below on behalf of your clients admitted that the grandfathered policies weren't going to be around very long because any change to an existing policy -- and he said these changes happen on a yearly basis. And we already know from the government's statistics that it's up to 40 percent now have grandfathered out. Your own client changed its policy, and that's why it's not grandfathered. And he changed it to drop contraceptives it was covering. And so my point is, since when does a transitioned grandfathered exemption and one that everybody knows will have to change, because premiums by definition will change or co-pays will change, something is going to change -- it's a very short transition period. Since when does that prove that the need is not compelling? I'm not sure that -- that squares with Lee. The -- the statute created the right to Social Security, and there the Court said you can't deprive employees of a statutory right because of your religious beliefs. So Lee is contrary to the point you're making. Those are alternatives that you're asking the government to incur or the person to incur. There isn't an alternative that doesn't put a cost on someone else. I'm sorry, General. You answered yes to Braunfeld. It was Jewish merchants, but it was the merchants themselves-- --the individuals-- --not the corporation that was going to be jailed. It was a-- --criminal prosecution. So whether it was a merchant that was a corporation or not was irrelevant. It was that the individual was-- --going to be jailed. So we go back to the start of my question, that would be essentially the same for vaccines, blood transfusions, non-pork products, the government has to pay for all of the medical needs that an employer thinks or claims it has a religious exemption to? Because those things are more important? It's really the amount of money-- --Well, but they-- --they make exemptions for vaccines, presumably, to some people on some basis, but we have a tax code that applies to everybody, but we have a million exemptions. Does the creation of the exemption relieve me from paying taxes when I have a sincere religious belief that taxes are immoral? Will your clients claim that filling out the form, if -- you're saying they would claim an exemption like the churches have already? ",be your claim limit to sensitive material like contraceptive or do it include item like blood transfusion vaccine for some religion product make of pork be any claim under your theory that have a religious basis could an employer preclude the use of those item as well how do a corporation exercise religion i mean i know how it speak and we have accord to our jurisprudence year of corporation speak in its own interest but where be the case that show that a corporation exercise religion well but they we be really argue about thing that affect their membership not them as a corporate entity

When I look at the list of items mentioned in the statute -- reservation, post, fort, arsenal, yard, station, or installation -- I don't think of command separate from operational control or being run by and used by the military. Each of those terms has an operational quality to it that mere ownership, which I equate with command, doesn't. It makes no sense, in answer to Justice Alito's question, to say you need notice, unless that facility has a military flavor to it that someone could know about. And you talk about this particular camp, but you've got a whole green line around it to tell people which sections you are actually considering the camp, and he was found outside of that green area. You've got a public school, a public highway. I'm not quite sure how you can keep a person off of lands that the military is not using in its operations. Well, you close down -- you close down roads for parades. You close down areas for other public needs. He couldn't go to the public school, though? Or the stores or any other facilities that the public's invited to?

But you're buying into this real property as being the defining term. I'm sorry. I have the same problem that Justice Breyer has. PXes belong to the military, generally, the land, but they are run by outside contractors, sometimes. Are you saying because they've given up exclusive control of the PX, that they fail your test? So does the utility company. I don't know if it's possible that military bases generate their own utilities, but I presume that, somewhere, they don't, and they have an easement to drive up and read their meters. There may be easements for repairs of certain underground things that -- that supply the base. That's not exclusive control, so I'm -- or possession. So what -- what does your test mean?

2013,Lozano v. Montoya Alvarez,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I'm sorry. That's turning legislative history in my mind on its head. They considered directly, if you study the SG's brief, a discovery rule that would have codified equitable tolling. And there was lengthy discussion about it and a decision that they wouldn't do that, that instead they would expand the period to a year where automatic return was required, and they introduced the best interest of the child after that year, and that that was now a balancing of all interests, the parents' and the child's. And you're right, they had other provisions that would affect the possible return or lack thereof, and they never wanted to stop a court from returning a child if it in its equitable discretion decided it was appropriate. But you're turning that legislative history on its head a little bit. Don't use up your time. What's the fairness-- --My gosh, all it takes it moving to Peoria. I mean, I don't mean to denigrate Peoria, but all it takes is moving to a place that has no connection to-- --Yes, obviously. [Laughter] Obviously. I do have a point -- a question though. What sense does this make when -- that a child who -- a suit is filed within the year, but the litigation takes 2 or the child who -- the filing is a day after the year, and the litigation takes a year and they're both in the same situation. Why should those two children be treated differently? Why should one have the benefit of settled now and the other not have it? What sense does it make when, as Justice Alito indicated, part of the central purposes of the Convention is to avoid the kidnapping of children? So why isn't Article 13 enough protection? It has to do with -- and unlike Justice Scalia, I don't think it's psychological or physical harm necessarily by the parent, but by the situation. The return. You agree with that. And they relied on Article 18, didn't they? That's the one year. Counsel, whatever fears my colleagues have, I've only found two, or I should say my clerks have only found two, published decisions in which courts have returned the child. So it's not as if they are ignoring the settlement issue. In fact, some might say that they are not giving abduction enough weight in -- in enough cases. But I -- the Hong Kong court who said there might not be discretion to return a settled child was not the highest court of Hong Kong, either. And so if we're going to give uniform meaning, the uniform meaning of international weight is that abduction is one factor for a court to consider in its equitable weighing on settlement, because that's the whole purpose of the Convention.

So give me an example of how the government can -- the hypothetical that Justice Alito spoke about and Justice Kagan, you've got -- or -- or Justice Breyer. But how do you square your position with the statutory language? The statutory language requires mandatory restitution order for the, quote, ""full amount of the victim's losses. "" It also forbids courts to -- to decline to issue an order, double negative, but it can't -- a court can't refuse to issue an order on the ground that the victim has been compensated by any other source. It seems to me that that language, as crazy as it seems to you or -- to you, compels joint and several liability, because it's saying any -- all losses, full amount of losses, and you can't offset her compensation from any other sources. So why isn't that a but-for cause? I mean, if you're going to argue that, you have to be arguing but-for-- --that their damages have to be the but-for cause. But aren't those all if we don't buy your argument, if we read into (F) proximate causation? So why are you wasting time on the argument if you win either way? Tell us without it.

So you disagree with Justice Scalia? He drew a distinction between two forms of materiality, whether something's materially false, meaning is it misleading. That, presumably, would go to a jury. But whether or not this misleading statement would be material to the TSA or to security officers is a question for the court. You disagree with that position by him?

Yeah, but we don't decide whether it was reasonable force if we think there's a question about that. No, no.

2013,United States v. Woods,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Excuse me. I thought I understood that to be your point in your brief, but I -- there is one thing missing from here. I also thought you were saying that you could impose the penalty before the amount was determined on the partnership level. That the tax that you could, without a notice of deficiency, require a payment upfront. That is the incongruity of your position in my mind. You claim that the decision of -- of whether or not or what the true value is of the basis and how much needs to be paid can't be determined until the partnership level -- until the partner level determination. Yet, you're claiming that you're entitled to an amount of money beforehand, before that decision is made. There's a tension in my mind about that. Mr. Stewart-- --Mr. Stewart, what -- what is this case a fight about? And -- and -- I'm sorry. Perhaps I'll just ask it on rebuttal, so you can save your time for rebuttal. But let me ask you something. There's no reason to go into a sham transaction except to misstate the outside basis in the individual partnership level. So I -- it's low-hanging fruit, according to the D.C. court. But why shouldn't you be able to pick it? I mean, it's sort of obvious, just as it's obvious that if a partnership item has a miscalculation that the partner is going to include it in their tax return later. That's why we permit the penalty to be imposed up front and to pay the tax up front, because you're making an assumption that it's been included erroneously on the partner level. Could you give me a concrete example, because I'm not quite sure about what you're talking about. I'm -- I'm a little confused on this example. Presumably, it's only if they carried forward, which we're assuming they would have done, carried forward the outside basis, the penalty would have been determined just on that one transaction. Could you -- could you go back just one moment to the practical point that your brother made? Is this issue only about whether you collect the tax beforehand or after?

The claim here is not whether he abused or didn't abuse the program. His allegation is that the only reason you terminated with a contract was because you wanted to get rid of these high flyers in your merger negotiations with the other airline.

2013,Kaley v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I see the government's strongest argument as being that the grand jury finding of probable cause is sacrosanct, and a hearing like the one that you are proposing would call the validity of that finding into question. Why don't you address that because we -- you were talking about in bail the validity of the charges are not at issue, just one factor in the court's determination of whether to restrain him or her is the strength of the government's case. Are you trying to draw a similar analogy here? There is at least five who are ruling similarly to yours. Just as a footnote, one in a million, which might be your case. I think that's the point. We would, presumably, if -- like here -- if there's a legal dispute and the government thinks the judge is wrong, they would try the case and go up on appeal and say to the appellate court the judge below was wrong initially. You would have lost the money in that case, but-- Do you have to go that -- I mean, your adversary just said that there was a judicial finding of no probable cause. I don't know why that judicial finding has any legal effect other than to release the money at issue. The judge is basically saying, like he does in a bail hearing, this evidence is not the strongest I've seen. In balancing the government's desire for restraint and the fundamental right to hire a lawyer of choice, it's not strong enough in this situation with what I've been presented to continue restraining the money. I don't see it as a legal determination that no probable cause. I see it as defining the word “ may ” in the statute. If the judge has discretion, that discretion has to be informed by something. How often has that happened in the five circuits? And that's the whole point, which is you talk about compulsion on the government, but the compulsion of the defendant not to have a hearing because they are required to say something that could put them at greater risk, whether it's because of the enhancements for obstruction of justice or merely from losing the advantage of their defense at trial, that's why these hearings are so rare. I think it's less about the government not wanting to disclose its case and more about the inducements against the defense wanting to preview its case.

2013,Robers v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, I have two related questions. The first is, what your client got was money, and I don't know why it's impossible, impractical or inadequate to measure the loss by the amount he got and order him or her to pay it. He can pay it on a payment schedule, on any -- in any way that the court wants him to pay it. So I don't know why we're in (b)(1) or (b)(2) at all because I don't see where the impracticality comes in. Answer that. But then, secondly, it's not clear to me that we're thinking about this right. There seems to be no dispute that a loss to the victim is the amount that the victim is spending to sell the property and recoup the money, and you don't seem to be taking issue with that. And 36 -- 3663(2) appears to be the return of the property at sentencing or sometime thereafter. So it doesn't seem to be controlling earlier return of property, and yet we're sort of stuck in that model that somehow it has to be an either/or. The earlier date of return or on the date of sentencing. But shouldn't it be -- and this follows up on Justice Kennedy's question -- shouldn't it be at the time the investor can reasonably secure something from the return of that property, the date of sale? If we're letting them recoup the expenses of sale, why don't we just simply recognize the value on that date? And if an investor who takes property inadequately decides to hold on to it or -- or with no reasonableness holds on to it or gives it away to their mother or sells it to somebody for a nominal fee, then it should be the date at which they got rid of it or the day -- or the value of the date -- on the date of return or something like that or the date that they should have done something with the property. Why are we stuck on these -- isn't the whole idea is to make the victim whole? Don't you make the victim whole on the day a reasonable investor would have gotten rid of the property? But money is fungible. That's my whole point. That may not make the seller whole. What makes the seller whole is on the day that he or she sold the item and received money. That's the government's point. But -- well, that's not the government's point, because the government wants to value it as of the date of the sentencing. But the -- but whatever the seller received on the day he or she sold the bat, that's the value that it -- that the seller has put on that item. Then that's -- that's the question. That-- --Well, not really. Not in -- not in this case. Because in this case, the property was sold. It was sold late. But it was not -- it was not -- it was sold before the sentencing. Yes. Well, that was my question earlier, which -- was it reasonable for that seller to hold on to the property that long? That wasn't the hypothetical. What happens if they decide to give the house to the banker, to his mother or grandmother? No, no, it doesn't bring into principles. You -- you have to give -- they took a property that had a value at some point-- --perhaps through the entire period. What date does the judge use to determine the value of that house? So you-- --You're -- you're -- yes, the judge would use his or her discretion and decide what would have been a reasonable value at that -- of that house at a time when the lender should have sold it. Not when they received it, not when the sentencing happened, not after the sentencing. But on the day the court decides whether a reasonable investor who's taken back the property should have converted it to cash. Exactly. That's -- that's my point exactly. But it also goes back to how do you measure and when do you measure this. It's easy if the property is returned on the date of sentencing or 90 days after, or not returned then. Because then the judge could basically figure out what's a reasonable time, the date of sentence or within the 90 days the day they sold the property. Right. But -- but the question becomes what happens when the house is done before -- given over not as a part of sentencing, but independently. And that -- and that's why I don't think any of these provisions really answer that question. And so why don't we go back to the basics? Why should the victim -- I think you agree with this -- why should the victim suffer the loss attendant to selling property that decreases in value because during the time that they were teeing it up for sale, the market dropped, and you say the victim shouldn't. All right. But let's assume that the market dropped and they sold it. What's the value you give to the -- to the victim? It's the date that the victim sold the property, no? Now, Justice Breyer asked you what happens if on some day they did something unreasonable. They just kept the property. They gave it to a grandmother. They sold it to someone for a nominal amount. A sham transaction. What does a judge do then? They kept the property because they just didn't want to sell it. They just let it die because they were lazy. Is that a case the victim should be made whole for their loss? So where do you value for the person who -- the -- the creditor, the secured creditor who acts unreasonably? Let's assume an unreasonable act, and you said it might have been commercially unreasonable to hold on to the property after somebody offered them twice the amount of their mortgage. So-- --what do you think of this test? In calculating a creditor's loss resulting from a secure transaction, the restitution order -- award should be offset by the amount that a reasonably diligent creditor, under the same or similar circumstances, could or would -- or did -- could, would or did obtain for the collateral? What does the defendant do if they act unreasonably after that order? If the bank does a nominal sale and only gets $100? ",counsel i have two related question the first be what your client get be money and i do not know why it be impossible impractical or inadequate to measure the loss by the amount he get and order him or her to pay it he can pay it on a payment schedule on any in any way that the court want him to pay it so i do not know why we be in b or b at all because i do not see where the impracticality come in answer that but then secondly it be not clear to me that we be think about this right there seem to be no dispute that a loss to the victim be the amount that the victim be spend to sell the property and recoup the money and you do not seem to be take issue with that and appear to be the return of the property at sentence or sometime thereafter so it do not seem to be control early return of property and yet we be sort of stuck in that model that somehow it have to be an eitheror the early date of return or on the date of sentence but should not it be and this follow up on justice kennedy s question should not it be at the time the investor can reasonably secure something from the return of that property the date of sale if we be let them recoup the expense of sale why do not we just simply recognize the value on that date and if an investor who take property inadequately decide to hold on to it or or with no reasonableness hold on to it or give it away to their mother or sell it to somebody for a nominal fee then it should be the date at which they get rid of it or the day or the value of the date on the date of return or something like that or the date that they should have do something with the property why be we stick on these be not the whole idea be to make the victim whole do not you make the victim whole on the day a reasonable investor would have get rid of the property but money be fungible that be my whole point that may not make the seller whole what make the seller whole be on the day that he or she sell the item and receive money that be the government s point but well that be not the government s point because the government want to value it as of the date of the sentencing but the but whatever the seller receive on the day he or she sell the bat that be the value that it that the seller have put on that item then that be that be the question that well not really not in not in this case because in this case the property be sell it be sell late but it be not it be not it be sell before the sentencing yes well that be my question earlier which be it reasonable for that seller to hold on to the property that long that be not the hypothetical what happen if they decide to give the house to the banker to his mother or grandmother no no it do not bring into principle you you have to give they take a property that have a value at some point perhaps through the entire period what date do the judge use to determine the value of that house so you you be you be yes the judge would use his or her discretion and decide what would have be a reasonable value at that of that house at a time when the lender should have sell it not when they receive it not when the sentencing happen not after the sentencing but on the day the court decide whether a reasonable investor who be take back the property should have convert it to cash exactly that be that be my point exactly but it also go back to how do you measure and when do you measure this it be easy if the property be return on the date of sentence or day after or not return then because then the judge could basically figure out what be a reasonable time the date of sentence or within the day the day they sell the property right but but the question become what happen when the house be do before give over not as a part of sentencing but independently and that and that be why i do not think any of these provision really answer that question and so why do not we go back to the basic why should the victim i think you agree with this why should the victim suffer the loss attendant to sell property that decrease in value because during the time that they we be tee it up for sale the market drop and you say the victim should not all right but let us assume that the market drop and they sell it what be the value you give to the to the victim it be the date that the victim sell the property no now justice breyer ask you what happen if on some day they do something unreasonable they just keep the property they give it to a grandmother they sell it to someone for a nominal amount a sham transaction what do a judge do then they keep the property because they just do not want to sell it they just let it die because they we be lazy be that a case the victim should be make whole for their loss so where do you value for the person who the the creditor the secure creditor who act unreasonably let us assume an unreasonable act and you say it might have be commercially unreasonable to hold on to the property after somebody offer them twice the amount of their mortgage so what do you think of this test in calculate a creditor s loss result from a secure transaction the restitution order award should be offset by the amount that a reasonably diligent creditor under the same or similar circumstance could or would or do could would or do obtain for the collateral what do the defendant do if they act unreasonably after that order if the bank do a nominal sale and only get ,441.69999999999993,Roberts Court,"Feb 25, 2014",Benjamin Robers,United States,12-9012,"Oct 21, 2013","May 5, 2014",113.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2013,Madigan v. Levin,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I'm not sure you see the distinction or -- or you're facing the distinction. The right not to be tried is one of qualified immunity. But you can have a constitutional violation and still not have a remedy, which is what this question involves. So, how do we deal with the concept that other people who have motions to dismiss that are denied still undergo trials, still experience the expense, and yet we've said repeatedly, an interlocutory appeal is not warranted. And so, what makes it warranted here where a Court has already said that there was a -- or at least there's enough evidence to suggest a constitutional violation and that a reasonable officer wouldn't have believed his or -- a person would have believed his or her conduct was appropriate? I'm sorry. I -- the only issue that's before us is whether someone who's exempted from the ADEA still has a 1983 claim, correct? That's what the Seventh Circuit said. If you're not a part of the statute, then you still have your 1983 rights? I don't know if you've satisfied my colleagues. I'm not sure that you've answered directly. I think your adversary is right that the Seventh Circuit held that no one is precluded from a 1983 claim, whether they're an employee or a non-employee. That's the way the case was litigated. That's the way they decided. The broad statement, whether he's an employee or not an employee, he doesn't have a 1983 -- he has a 1983 action. You've come in and you've said he's not an employee, so he's entitled to his 1983 claim. All right. My colleagues are asking you, that only takes care of half of this problem, because the circuit said even if he was an employee he would still have it. And so you're being asked, are you giving up that part of the claim, that he's not an employee? Can you tell me what the authority is for Congress to extinguish a right for a constitutional violation? Meaning-- --assume that someone -- it was the question that Justice Alito asked you -- someone under of the age of 40, someone who's not covered by any statute, someone who's part of an employer under 20. What would suggest to you in this statute that Congress intended to extinguish those people's rights? I'm sorry. Restate that again so I understand what you are saying.

And that's because they have this changed circumstance rule where it has -- the change can only be something like a new fund? Answer his point, however.

2014,Holt v. Hobbs,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Could you put your answer in practical terms. The Chief Justice asks you what's the legal principle that you want us to apply, and you announce it as give them the right deference. It's a little bit circular, the answer, in my mind. Looking at what the circuits have been doing, which one do you think articulates the best approach to RLUIPA and what courts should be doing? Could you -- you know, we seem to be arguing rules. They say no beards. You say half-inch is okay. And then the question begs itself, if -- how about three-quarters of an inch, how about an inch, and what about full beard? What are we measuring this against? Are you seeking to establish a rule that every prisoner has to be permitted to grow a 1/2-inch beard and no more, or are you asking for a rule that applies just to your client and then articulate why for your client? So what happens -- I know the magistrate judge or the judge below here said that it was preposterous to think that this prisoner could hide anything in his 1/2-inch beard. Assuming that his 1/2-inch beard was not thickly grown, but some are, and some you can't see the skin. Should that 1/2-inch issue be applied to that prisoner? Wouldn't it be a different set of facts in that case to consider? Can I go back to -- just so I'm clear in my head -- to two compelling, two compelling interests, one in identification, one in contraband. Is there a third or a fourth or are those the only two? And in this case, the magistrate judge has said it's preposterous to think that you could hide something. You don't have a security -- contraband-- --It is somewhat hard for me, given what you just said, to figure this out, because there may be in my mind some situations with some prisoners where a half inch beard won't hide anything, and with others that it will. Doesn't this law require you to consider the individual before you and to accommodate them in the least restrictive way? So let's assume that what the magistrate judge meant -- which is what I assumed; you have a different read -- that it's preposterous to think this prisoner could hide something in his beard, but not preposterous to think that others might not be able to do so. Assume my hypothetical. No. My question is one of whether you're obligated under this statute-- --to look at the request of the individual and assume that the application of whatever rule you create can't have an exception as to that individual. Yes. But I don't know. Given the deference that was given here, the question is, was it applied too broadly? What I'm getting at is does the Court have to look at the individual request and figure out whether it can be accommodated in the least restrictive way? In this case. Now, on the change of looks, I'm still not sure. Could you describe it in more detail? I obviously missed it in the record. What is this barracks situation? They leave the compound. Where do they go when they leave the compound? Are these unprotected fields? What about this whole issue about cost in the statute 2000-cc-3(c) that says, ""This chapter may require a government to incur expenses in its own operations to avoid imposing a substantial burden on religious exercise. "" So isn't -- it's anticipating-- --that there might be expense. Cost. It -- it doesn't implicate the cost issue. ",could you put your answer in practical term the chief justice ask you what be the legal principle that you want us to apply and you announce it as give them the right deference it be a little bit circular the answer in my mind look at what the circuit have be do which one do you think articulate the best approach to rluipa and what court should be do could you you know we seem to be argue rule they say no beard you say half inch be okay and then the question beg itself if how about three quarter of an inch how about an inch and what about full beard what be we measure this against be you seek to establish a rule that every prisoner have to be permit to grow a inch beard and no more or be you ask for a rule that apply just to your client and then articulate why for your client so what happen i know the magistrate judge or the judge below here say that it be preposterous to think that this prisoner could hide anything in his inch beard assume that his inch beard be not thickly grown but some be and some you can not see the skin should that inch issue be apply to that prisoner would not it be a different set of fact in that case to consider can i go back to just so I be clear in my head to two compelling two compelling interest one in identification one in contraband be there a third or a fourth or be those the only two and in this case the magistrate judge have say it be preposterous to think that you could hide something you do not have a security contraband it be somewhat hard for me give what you just say to figure this out because there may be in my mind some situation with some prisoner where a half inch beard will not hide anything and with others that it will do not this law require you to consider the individual before you and to accommodate them in the least restrictive way so let us assume that what the magistrate judge meant which be what i assume you have a different read that it be preposterous to think this prisoner could hide something in his beard but not preposterous to think that others might not be able to do so assume my hypothetical no my question be one of whether you be obligate under this statute to look at the request of the individual and assume that the application of whatever rule you create can not have an exception as to that individual yes but i do not know give the deference that be give here the question be be it apply too broadly what I be get at be do the court have to look at the individual request and figure out whether it can be accommodate in the least restrictive way in this case now on the change of look I be still not sure could you describe it in more detail i obviously miss it in the record what be this barrack situation they leave the compound where do they go when they leave the compound be these unprotected field what about this whole issue about cost in the statute cc c that say this chapter may require a government to incur expense in its own operation to avoid impose a substantial burden on religious exercise so be not it be anticipate that there might be expense cost it it do not implicate the cost issue ,247.62,Roberts Court,"Oct 7, 2014",Gregory Houston Holt,"Ray Hobbs, Director, Arkansas Department of Corrections, et al.",13-6827,"Mar 3, 2014","Jan 20, 2015",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2014,Coleman v. Tollefson,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I'm sorry. I'm a little confused here. There's no judgment to be entered if the prisoner can't file because of the third strike. There is no complaint to stay, and there's no judgment to stay. I actually don't even think -- I hadn't considered this, because we -- appellate courts have no jurisdiction until there's a final judgment. There's no 54(b) -- there's no 54(b) standard that would be met and there's no anything standard that would be met. The problem here is not that case. The problem here is the next case, if there is one. But it has to be dealt with under anybody's interpretation. Once you admitted, which you must, that in one case there could be two strikes, then if there's a second case, a third case, or no, a second case, but a third strike at the District Court level, you still have to face the question of whether there's a right to appeal -- If it means what it means, then there's only two strikes anyway because there was or two prior cases or two prior -- By the way, how many of those courts count the time or rely on the time for cert? Do you know if any of those courts, the majority of the courts except for two, have outfit for addressing things your way? And -- and I have a slight leaning towards letting the majority of circuit courts figure out administrative -- the ease of administrative rules. How many of them thought of it as just being easier to do? The problem with the ordinary rule is that it really doesn't apply completely until the next case. It applies in that case, but it doesn't apply in the next case. Meaning let's talk about res judicata or collateral estoppel. If it's res judicata, it's the two parties. So that -- that's that case, essentially. If it's collateral estoppel, it could be until a third party. But I think that that third party would be entitled to a stay of his or her action pending the adjudication of the main action. Except that the -- there's still a right to ask the court of appeals for a COA, and so there is an appellate process of sorts. Right. Answer -- answer Judge -- Judge Easterbrook's point, that there is no way to revive a subsequently filed case that was dismissed because of a third strike. Judge Easterbrook, and I think there's some force to his logic, says with this -- this three-strike situation, when the next case comes to the court of -- to a district court, district court never files the complaint. There was nothing dismissed that can be revived. There was no judgment entered. But -- but there's no remedy for the fact that subsequent lawsuits that were -- that were filed based on the erroneous third strike would have been turned back without the filing of a complaint. And nothing -- or to file a 60(b). Sort of an interesting question, basically admitting that in terms of your time, the suits would still remain because they could file in State court? Why use the word ""occasion"" at all? Meaning: What meaning do you give to that word? Why didn't they just say ""three dismissals""? It seems to me you could have just said, if a prisoner has three dismissals, then -- three prior dismissals; not three prior occasions, three prior dismissals -- he can't get IFP thereafter. Was it your brief that said there were very few cases -- you found only two published cases? That's what my question was, okay. Then answer Judge Easterbook's point, which is, when the fourth case comes in, the court is just not granting IFP. It's not dismissing the case, it's just not filing it at all. It's just saying to you, I won't commence the litigation, I won't accept it without you paying IFP. ",I be sorry I be a little confused here there be no judgment to be enter if the prisoner can not file because of the third strike there be no complaint to stay and there be no judgment to stay i actually do not even think i have not consider this because we appellate court have no jurisdiction until there be a final judgment there be no b there be no b standard that would be meet and there be no anything standard that would be meet the problem here be not that case the problem here be the next case if there be one but it have to be deal with under anybody s interpretation once you admit which you must that in one case there could be two strike then if there be a second case a third case or no a second case but a third strike at the district court level you still have to face the question of whether there be a right to appeal if it mean what it mean then there be only two strike anyway because there be or two prior case or two prior by the way how many of those court count the time or rely on the time for cert do you know if any of those court the majority of the court except for two have outfit for address thing your way and and i have a slight leaning towards let the majority of circuit court figure out administrative the ease of administrative rule how many of them thought of it as just be easy to do the problem with the ordinary rule be that it really do not apply completely until the next case it apply in that case but it do not apply in the next case mean let us talk about re judicata or collateral estoppel if it be re judicata it be the two party so that that be that case essentially if it be collateral estoppel it could be until a third party but i think that that third party would be entitle to a stay of his or her action pending the adjudication of the main action except that the there be still a right to ask the court of appeal for a coa and so there be an appellate process of sort right answer answer judge judge easterbrook s point that there be no way to revive a subsequently file case that be dismiss because of a third strike judge easterbrook and i think there be some force to his logic say with this this three strike situation when the next case come to the court of to a district court district court never file the complaint there be nothing dismiss that can be revive there be no judgment enter but but there be no remedy for the fact that subsequent lawsuit that we be that we be file base on the erroneous third strike would have be turn back without the filing of a complaint and nothing or to file a b sort of an interesting question basically admit that in term of your time the suit would still remain because they could file in state court why use the word occasion at all meaning what mean do you give to that word why do not they just say three dismissal it seem to me you could have just say if a prisoner have three dismissal then three prior dismissal not three prior occasion three prior dismissal he can not get ifp thereafter be it your brief that say there we be very few case you find only two publish case that be what my question be okay then answer judge easterbook s point which be when the fourth case come in the court be just not grant ifp it be not dismiss the case it be just not file it at all it be just say to you i will not commence the litigation i will not accept it without you pay ifp ,272.02000000000004,Roberts Court,"Feb 23, 2015",Andre Lee Coleman,"Todd Tollefson, et al.",13-1333,"Oct 2, 2014","May 18, 2015",113.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2014,Ohio v. Clark,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Doesn't the -- Isn't the test whether the statement is intended to be testimonial in nature? So whether it's given to a private individual or a police officer is irrelevant. The question is, was it intended to substitute for testimony to be used later. Well, let's -- You're forgetting -- you're forgetting the circumstances prong of it. Were the questions here by the interrogator for purposes of law enforcement or were they for the purposes of the ongoing emergency, the abuse of the child? So -- Well, that goes to reliability, and that goes to whatever the finder of fact, whether they take that approach or they take another. But the point, I think, that Justice Kagan is making in deciding the intent of the declarant, you have to look at what everyone else is doing and who they are. I'm sorry, you start by saying she fed him a line. I understood that she asked him who did it and he said Dee, and she didn't know what Dee meant. Well, but it wasn't as if she got Dee out of thin air. Mr. Fisher -- -- I want to go back to your basic premise. I know that you're attacking the competency question a lot. But what is it about the statement that makes it testimonial? Is it the rule that the State -- that she's a mandatory reporter, as the Ohio court thought? Tell me what you think. Is it any out-of-court statement? What -- what is it that makes it testimonial? That's a big assumption, to know that this child understood the criminal process at three years old. And when -- how long before had the -- -- children been removed? And why -- Why did the teacher bother saying that she wanted to make sure that it wasn't another child? Mr. Fisher, you -- in Davis, when an abused woman is separated from the abuser, she can voluntarily say, ""I don't want to go back."" She can make her own choices. How does a child make those choices? I -- I know for many women it's not -- they don't perceive it as a real choice. I'm not naysaying that. But I think there is a difference in terms of protecting a child and protecting an adult. But what you've -- but you haven't raised a Due Process argument.

You're claiming it's a Shaw challenge, but you don't have to describe the injury. It's a -- it's an ephemeral injury; race played a part in the overall plan, without an effect in a particular district. If a particular district-- --I mean, if it stayed essentially the same, they didn't move the boundaries much, they obviously -- they don't -- it's an all-white district. If they moved the boundaries, it wasn't to include more blacks or anything else. It was just because of -- of geographic divisions.

But that wasn't true any-- --I'm still having a psychological problem with your point. There were three reasons.

2014,"T-Mobile South, LLC v. City of Roswell, Georgia",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"That's not actually what the court below said. It said that it could discern the reasons from the record. That's a very different statement than saying there are no reasons set forth. Mr. Fisher, assume, and just for the sake of argument, that we do say that a separate writing that clearly sets forth or sets forth the reasons for denial is adequate. I understand you to say that this is not adequate because it's not clear presumably; am I correct? Under this board's rules, do -- I'm assuming the board has to be unanimous, majoritarian voting rules, but why does every council member have to have the same reason? Can't different people say no for different reasons? Oh. So your-- I'm -- I'm a little bit confused by that because and this is what troubles me the most. You get five council members, five different reasons. At what point does he win, meaning if he proves that three of them were wrong in their reasons, so there wasn't a majority vote for anything? That's what he has to do? That's a-- --What does the -- what does the Petitioner do with the one council member who didn't give reasons? What does that person count as? It was four people who were there. There were five. One didn't speak, so you don't count his or her vote. So it's a split vote. So when do you think the statute of limitations runs? The 30 days? So why couldn't the city council or this legislative body have waited until its official minutes and sent the letter that day with the minutes? Well, that endorses more or less the SG's position. What you're saying, I think, in answer to the question presented, the written denial doesn't have to itself as a document, provide the reasons, but when it's sent it has to have attached to it, referenced, something that is available telling you the reasons. Something that-- --Could you-- --So that inquiry and challenge will be left up to judges to figure out what the minutes say, don't say, and what the reasons were. All right. Let's go back to, we had five members here. One didn't talk. Do you agree we don't count that person? All right. Now, do we need a majority rule, a majority of the council people giving a reason? Please articulate your rule, because you just said to us earlier that not every body of this type has -- has minutes, or minutes that become the statement of reasons. So what's the rule, a general rule about what's the final decision and when the time starts to run, assuming-- --How does that rule -- now we're forcing minutes on every -- on every city council to have contained the statement of reasons? ",that be not actually what the court below say it say that it could discern the reason from the record that be a very different statement than say there be no reason set forth mr fisher assume and just for the sake of argument that we do say that a separate writing that clearly set forth or set forth the reason for denial be adequate i understand you to say that this be not adequate because it be not clear presumably be i correct under this board s rule do I be assume the board have to be unanimous majoritarian voting rule but why do every council member have to have the same reason can not different people say no for different reason oh so your I be I be a little bit confuse by that because and this be what trouble me the most you get five council member five different reason at what point do he win mean if he prove that three of them we be wrong in their reason so there be not a majority vote for anything that have what he have to do that be a what do the what do the petitioner do with the one council member who do not give reason what do that person count as it be four people who we be there there we be five one do not speak so you do not count his or her vote so it be a split vote so when do you think the statute of limitation run the day so why could not the city council or this legislative body have wait until its official minute and send the letter that day with the minute well that endorse more or less the sg s position what you be say i think in answer to the question present the write denial do not have to itself as a document provide the reason but when it be send it have to have attach to it reference something that be available tell you the reason something that could you so that inquiry and challenge will be leave up to judge to figure out what the minute say do not say and what the reason we be all right let us go back to we have five member here one do not talk do you agree we do not count that person all right now do we need a majority rule a majority of the council people give a reason please articulate your rule because you just say to us early that not every body of this type have have minute or minute that become the statement of reason so what be the rule a general rule about what be the final decision and when the time start to run assume how do that rule now we be force minute on every on every city council to have contain the statement of reason ,197.40000000000006,Roberts Court,"Nov 10, 2014","T-Mobile South, LLC","City of Roswell, Georgia",13-975,"May 5, 2014","Jan 14, 2015",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2014,Kerry v. Din,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Could I ask you a question? Assume the following hypothetical. You had an erroneous name, meaning -- or there's a duplicate name, a terrorist and a non- -- and a non-terrorist alien. What you're telling us is that there's no remedy whatsoever for the alien to come in and try to show someone that he's not the guy who's the terrorist. I asked -- I have a real problem, which is that's what we were told after September 11th, and we have evidence that people were kept for months and months and months, and some were released after there was further probing by the courts, and it was determined that people had been erroneously identified. So I'm not challenging good faith, but I'm just questioning how someone caught up in an administrative nightmare -- you're suggesting that the wife has absolutely no interest in -- in -- in her marriage in not having the government arbitrarily keep her spouse out. Now, it's your position that the government could basically say to a wife in the United States, you have no rights whatsoever to challenge the arbitrary -- or a statement by the government. We believe your husband is a terrorist. You can't stay with him. Only the husband could challenge them? Yes. Ah, so you're saying in that situation marriage has -- gives her no rights to say, you're interfering with my marriage by arbitrarily keeping my husband. Not talking if he's arrested or if he's -- but do -- you're just saying -- Mr. Kneedler -- If Mandel did control this case, what argument would you make -- or could you make an argument that you -- that you met the Mandel standard? And as I understood the Mandel standard, it wasn't that high. It was you have to provide a facially legitimate and bona fide reason for your decision. So would you please answer Justice Scalia's earlier point, which is, are we going to get a slew of lawsuits from wives saying that their husbands were treated -- had an unfair trial or unfairly accused? Now, don't tell me it won't happen cause it hasn't -- -- because -- tell me what the argument would be as to why that case would not be sustainable. But she has been privy to it, and she has, as Justice Scalia said, a husband who's taking tactical steps that are against his interests. So this is a serious question. I very much am troubled by this part of your argument. How do we announce, and what rule do we announce? That's too far a statement, Mr. Kneedler. I can imagine too many hypotheticals where the government could afford or could treat aliens that are in the United States in an unconstitutional way.

2014,Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Clement, I just want to clarify your position. Are you suggesting that the lack of legislative control is at issue only or are you saying that we have to overturn Hildebrant and Smiley? That's sort of hard to understand because we made it very clear in Smiley and in Hildebrant that we're defining legislature in this clause as meaning legislative process. I -- but -- but this makes no sense to me, because I think it's an either/or. If the legislature has the power, how can the governor veto it? How can a popular referendum veto it? Either they have the power or they don't. And if a State constitution says that the people hold the power and they can choose a commission or however else they want to do it, isn't that the legislative process? So please tell me -- So -- But why is that unconstitutional and an impasse in the legislature and leaving it then to a third-party who is not the legislature, why is that constitutional? That's what you just said, that's constitutional. So that bypasses 2a(c) altogether? Could I ask you this simple question? I know you're going to say it's a constitutional requirement, but if I read Hildebrant and Smiley differently, and I think there's plenty of language in there to suggest so, but if I read it differently to say that what the Election Clause means is the legislative process, isn't that just simple? We never have to worry about how the States experiment, what they do in their own self-governance. Why is that a Federal interest? No, they didn't, actually. When you look at the -- the -- the legislative history on this, the Federalists' papers, not a whole lot on this particular clause. Mr. Feigin, isn't this a diminution of the power to legislate, not of a particular plan or of a particular law and plan? This is the removal of power from the legislature. They have an interest in the constitutional powers they have. Mr. Feigin -- I guess the bottom-line question is: Let's assume 2a(c) said something totally different, which is we removed redistricting from the legislature, and we require every State to pass it by -- redistricting by referendum.

2014,"Mach Mining, LLC v.

I can't find any consistency among more than about two of them. And so I go back to -- I know you say you've cited cases about the imperative of judicial review, but on the administrative level, it's after a final action. This is not a final action. Oh, well, I agree with you. But I'm trying to find something analogous and there isn't. But I don't know how you make something that's designated by Congress as informal into a formal proceeding. Mr. Goldstein, can I -- can I stop a moment? If the inquiry is about what happened-- --at -- at the hearing-- --At the conciliation. I misspoke. Okay. It seems to me, though, that that may be what you're arguing now, but if we look at the record below, first you didn't want to waive confidentiality. You then put in a set of interrogatories that demands to know what the EEOC -- who the EEOC contacted, how they measured their damages, and a bunch of other stuff, still not waiving confidentiality. This new thing of yours that says if you challenge it when I make a motion, then I can disclose it. I think what Justice Breyer's getting to is, you know whether someone conciliated or not. You can say exactly what the EEOC did or didn't do or failed to do. But instead, you want a whole discovery process attached to this. And that's my problem here-- --which it's very simple for you to come in and say, we called, we asked to meet, they wouldn't meet with us. No, no, no, no. I don't want to know what you want. I want to know what happens because that's the only way I can judge whether there was good faith. So if you walked in and said, I'm not going to listen to you until you give me A, B, and C, I might say you weren't acting in good faith. So you'd have all of the discovery and the conciliation process in 30 days. That -- that's basically what you want to -- to have. Ms. Saharsky, let me just ask you a simple question. You send a letter, they call you, and you say, don't want to talk to you, hang up. 30 days later, you send the letter that you send routinely that says conciliation failed. How do they get a court to review that under your theory of the case? Because you say the only thing the court can review is whether conciliation was offered and whether it ended. So here it was offered, but we're not even talking about good faith. You just say I'm not going to. ""You"" meaning the government. So how do you review that if you're a court? Now, I don't want to hear we sent letters. I -- I'm positing the hypothetical: You sent letters, but when they called you said, we're going to trial. You didn't make -- no discussion whatsoever. You sent the letter, they called and said, let's sit down, and you -- and the government says, no. Okay? Tell me how we -- how we write a decision that avoid -- that addresses that kind of case. I know what your position is, but assume ours is just the hypothetical. It doesn't mean you've lost, but ours is that we have to give some teeth to judicial review greater than what you're suggesting. Justice Kennedy asked you once. I'm asking you -- or I asked you once before, he's asked again, and I'm asking again. Give us give us what you don't want. Give us a way to write it that gives you the least -- the less intrusion -- the least intrusion but more than what you want to do. Shouldn't the game be on you? They come in and say, we conciliated. Shouldn't you have to waive confidentiality and set forth circumstances? I'm going back to Justice Breyer's point about the IRS case, because there we required the party saying that something-- --was in bad faith-- --or didn't happen-- --to set forth the circumstances. All right? But you didn't do that here.

What they're asking you to do is to look -- they're asking the government to lie. I'm not that's exactly what you're saying the government should the executive department should not do. This is a pretty rough way to identify someone. I mean, there are hundreds of John Smith's in the United States. General, if I'm understanding your narrow holding, just so that we can underscore it, what you're saying is that Congress can't compel speech by the President with respect to foreign relations. General, in general, when I travel abroad and come back to the United States or when I go to a foreign country and they're stamping my passport, do they have forms that require you to identify the city? No, it's not. It's the place of birth. If you say Israel, you believe that -- you're saying that you believe that person was born in Israel. And there was a waiver -- and there was a waiver provided and every President has exercised the waiver. How could you tell me it's not a lie? You, the United States, are being asked to put on the passport that you believe the place of birth of this individual is Israel, and the government -- and the executive has said, no, we don't think it was Israel, we think it was Jerusalem. But the individual is not the one issuing the passport. It's the government. The document says. This is a diplomatic exchange between sovereigns.

On his plea for this possession, was he charged with another crime? I'm sorry. Do we know how many possession crimes have been prosecuted, possession for short-barreled shotguns? That's what I mean. It's about 600 a year? More or less. So we're talking about 35,000 people or 40,000 who own the shotguns legally. I see what you mean. If that's the case, how many charges do you have that are for mere possession, not involved with an underlying crime? She raises 14 cases in her reply brief. So why haven't they been outlawed federally and why is it only a minority of States that have outlawed their -- just their possession, not their registration? How many-- --Pardon-- --I'm a little still confused about the felony possession, okay? You say that's not a crime of violence. I -- I don't know how to differentiate that from this because most felons, in possession of a gun, I'm sure the statistics would show, are committing crimes. So if the question is the risk of injury to others, it would be a felon possessing a handgun of any kind and not a common citizen. Because, yes, common citizens more often than not, we hope, use guns that they possess for lawful purposes; but felons, I would think, just as a matter of logic, what Justice Alito was asking, that felons more often than not use guns in illegal activities. Well, I understand that. I just want you to give me some sort of analytical approach on when to judge that -- when to judge that risk, or how to differentiate that risk-- --so that everything, no -- every possession crime doesn't become a crime of violence.

2014,B&B Hardware Inc. v. Hargis Industries Inc.,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Well, just-- --I have a bit of a problem, okay? We have held that in -- in Kappos last year or two terms ago -- I've now lost track of time -- that an applicant who loses before the board can introduce new evidence at the trial. So we have made the assumption that -- that an applicant doesn't have to produce everything. So what happens in the situation when there is new evidence? What kind of deference do we owe then? Is it -- that's why I think Justice Alito said this might be a unique case because I -- then -- your adversary may tell me and tell me differently -- the two proceedings had almost identical evidence. No. Just assume that there's new evidence that they want to present at the infringement trial. So what's the charge the court gives? What deference does the court ask to be given to the board in that situation? It didn't have evidence that existed before. So you're talking about the effects of full preclusion. If you could have, you should have. You have alternatively argued in your brief for some form of deference if we're not going to call it preclusive. It seemed to me that that was addressing an issue you didn't seek cert on, which was whether the court below erred in not permitting the mark holder to -- to tell the jury that the board had found a similarity and confusion. But I don't know that you've actually made that argument, number one. And number two, on what would you base a holding of deference? In what field of law do we say, give deference and how -- what -- what's the standard that we would use? All right. That's an even -- that's another fudge word, “ material ”. They have represented one, which was the use of the mark with the word “ fastener ” or whatever it was that the -- that the Solicitor General's Office referred to earlier, that Mr. Jay referred to earlier. So get to the stuff you think is immaterial. But you do have that alternative before -- after a board action. Well, that's my problem, which is, it seems to me, that you are rendering the board proceeding almost irrelevant with respect to litigation. And it may be when you're seeking de novo review, but why should we say that you get a second bite at the apple after you've wasted the board's time? Why not just tell you go straight -- if you're going to wait for an infringement action, go there. Except that in Kappos, we explicitly said that some weight should be given to the board's judgment. So it's not as if it's being ignored altogether, right? But that's not what happened here. The court below said, no, you can't give a jury -- you can't describe to this jury what the trademark board did. You can't decide whether it was the same evidence and how much weight to give. That's not the path that was followed here. Was that presented to the board in this case? Was it presented to the board? That answer. How you use the mark, the market. I thought the board did. You didn't answer my question. Was all of that -- was the same evidence-- --I -- I understand you-- --I -- I'm sorry. You keep saying we tried to put it in. Did you put it in? The board did recite that they were used in a different market, and a lot of things that suggest they had all the information that you ultimately put in on trial -- at trial. By the way, is there a record? I should have looked for it earlier. Is the trademark record before us in the joint appendix? Yes. No, no, no. The record that was submitted to the trademark court. I didn't-- --I'm not sure that I buy that, because to the extent that someone's not going to settle and go away or get a sublicense, why should we be now inviting, instead of a district court proceeding, inviting an infringement action? I mean, that will -- that's going to be more lengthy no matter what because then damages and a lot of other things are involved. ",well just i have a bit of a problem okay we have hold that in in kappos last year or two term ago I have now lose track of time that an applicant who lose before the board can introduce new evidence at the trial so we have make the assumption that that an applicant do not have to produce everything so what happen in the situation when there be new evidence what kind of deference do we owe then be it that be why i think justice alito say this might be a unique case because i then your adversary may tell me and tell me differently the two proceeding have almost identical evidence no just assume that there be new evidence that they want to present at the infringement trial so what be the charge the court give what deference do the court ask to be give to the board in that situation it do not have evidence that exist before so you be talk about the effect of full preclusion if you could have you should have you have alternatively argue in your brief for some form of deference if we be not go to call it preclusive it seem to me that that be address an issue you do not seek cert on which be whether the court below err in not permit the mark holder to to tell the jury that the board have find a similarity and confusion but i do not know that you have actually make that argument number one and number two on what would you base a holding of deference in what field of law do we say give deference and how what what be the standard that we would use all right that be an even that be another fudge word material they have represent one which be the use of the mark with the word fastener or whatever it be that the that the solicitor general s office refer to earlier that mr jay refer to earlier so get to the stuff you think be immaterial but you do have that alternative before after a board action well that be my problem which be it seem to me that you be render the board proceed almost irrelevant with respect to litigation and it may be when you be seek de novo review but why should we say that you get a second bite at the apple after you have waste the board s time why not just tell you go straight if you be go to wait for an infringement action go there except that in kappos we explicitly say that some weight should be give to the board s judgment so it be not as if it be be ignore altogether right but that be not what happen here the court below say no you can not give a jury you can not describe to this jury what the trademark board do you can not decide whether it be the same evidence and how much weight to give that be not the path that be follow here be that present to the board in this case be it present to the board that answer how you use the mark the market i think the board do you do not answer my question be all of that be the same evidence i i understand you i I be sorry you keep say we try to put it in do you put it in the board do recite that they we be use in a different market and a lot of thing that suggest they have all the information that you ultimately put in on trial at trial by the way be there a record i should have look for it early be the trademark record before us in the joint appendix yes no no no the record that be submit to the trademark court i do not I be not sure that i buy that because to the extent that someone s not go to settle and go away or get a sublicense why should we be now invite instead of a district court proceeding invite an infringement action i mean that will that be go to be more lengthy no matter what because then damage and a lot of other thing be involve ,272.69,Roberts Court,"Dec 2, 2014",B&B Hardware Inc.,Hargis Industries Inc.,13-352,"Jul 1, 2014","Mar 24, 2015",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2014,Whitfield v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"That's a -- that's a very different rule than in your brief. I could buy a de minimis rule, but I don't know where you get the word “ substantial ”. Let's say we disagree. Where would you find “ de minimis ”? How much is a few feet? I thought the record was different. I thought the record was 14 to 20? I'm sorry. 8 -- no. I was right. Go ahead. I don't think that a few feet from a cash register to a vault -- I've actually never seen the vault. It's usually locked away behind the main area, so that's going to be another room, and it's going to be not necessarily a short distance. I can see -- I think the statistics that we were shown is that the vast majority of bank robberies are at the counter, that people are not moved at all. What's wrong with de minimis? Meaning why don't we leave it to the jury to decide when a movement is inconsequential, what is trivial? We're worried about telling them what that 2 what that is, but we use the word de minimis all the time, and all we tell juries is you don't have to find this if the movement was really trivial and inconsequential. And they can then use their judgment instead of the prosecutor about when something is causing the kind of fear that Congress worried about. Well, we we've basically said, albeit only a civil area, that we always assume that trivial and inconsequential matters will not be covered by law. I don't know why that can't be true in the criminal area either. But the problem is that there is some fortuity in this.

2014,"Baker Botts, LLP v. ASARCO, LLC",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"But the trustee is not the estate. The estate wants to keep as much money as it can to give to the creditors. That's the purpose, right? If you hired another law firm to fight this objection, would that other law firm have been entitled to fees too? I just want to understand your rule completely. Anybody who prepares a fee application -- an accountant, an expert -- the bankruptcy court can pay all of their legal fees, if the trustee has hired their lawyer? Approved their lawyer? But if the trustee hasn't, then they have to assume the costs of fighting -- That was in the context of a fee splitting statute though. You're ignoring one important aspect of difference which is in everything else, you're acting for the estate. When you're defending fees, you're acting for yourself. There is a self-interest involved because you could just give up on the objections and walk away. The only reason you're fighting them is because it puts more money in your pocket. Not because it puts more money in the estate's pocket. So why isn't that in the administration? Sounds like a policy judgment. You're basically saying it's not in the statute, but this is how we do it and as Justice -- as the Chief Justice pointed out, normal attorneys outside the bankruptcy court don't get compensated for fee disputes. So how does the fee fit into this? The -- the fee, the fee -- the fee preparation fee. In the papers -- Do you practice in bankruptcy? Do you practice in bankruptcy? And do you happen to know whether fee litigation is more common in bankruptcy than in other fields? Okay. I thought you said earlier the trustee had to approve it. And I'm wondering how the trustee could approve that, because it's for the benefit of the accountant, and not the trust. Except -- except that in Woods, looking at the predecessor statute, which also talked about services rendered, we held that the phrase ""reasonable compensation for services rendered,"" quote, this is us, ""necessarily implies loyal and disinterested service in the interest of those for whom the claimant purported to act.""

2014,"Alabama Department of Revenue v. CSX Transportation, Inc.",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"But the problem is that, generally, one thinks of sales and use taxes as flip sides of each other. But here, the basis of a comparison is not quite similar. Because in one it measures what you buy, whether you use the gas in State or out of State, and the other meant -- measures only what you use in Alabama. So there is a dissimilarity in the comparison that's not the norm. The circuit below said that was fortuitous and that at some point that could change.

Are you going to suggest that if they stop at a dock and eat a meal, they can't be charged a sales tax?

I'm -- I'm just not moved by the purpose part for the following reason. I think your brother was absolutely correct that how the state uses its tax revenues is a personal decision by it. It could have put all of the money into the treasury and said, but we're going to calculate what we spend on highways according to this formula, because we want to do it. That's exactly what they've done here. They could say we're going to beautify the route for railroads, and we're going to give them X amount of money to do that from our state treasury, and we're calculating it a little bit from the fuel they bought. How do we do that? How do we do that with -- with the water carriers? I -- I do see your point with respect to the motor vehicle drivers because there the entire argument was around comparability and was it comparable. And the court said -- but it basically said we're not going to get into it. If they call it something else, we won't do it-- --It didn't quite say what you said. Now -- now you want a really broad rule that says you've got to -- you've got to use the same label on every tax, States. You've got to treat competitors with the same label all of the time.

2014,Davis v. Ayala,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"You know, your -- your brief confused me, and it took me a while to pull it apart. All right. I don't know that there's a dispute -- or at least there's a dispute in the application. But really, the deference here was given to the harmless error finding or purported to have been given. So there's no -- there's no dispute that the court below committed an error, meaning that the court below didn't apply the right standards, a factual question. The issue, I think, that you're trying to arrive at is under the circumstances of this case, that the Court also reached the performance prod of Strickland, and that's really where the dispute is, isn't it? I -- if we were to find that it wasn't a reasonable finding, then we would have to reach the first decision. So assume that it was unreasonable. Let's go back to the first issue. Yes, in Williams and Harrington, we have said that if there are multiple claims and the State court just says everything's denied, you assume that means Federal and State. If the State claim is the same as the Federal claim, we say, they -- they -- they -- we assume they meant the Federal claim as well. But this is sort of an interesting case because the -- they said there was constitutional error under State law, but they studiously avoided Federal saying there was one or not under Federal law. And they dismissed the Federal claim just on the harmlessness prong. And what the Ninth Circuit said, as I understand, they didn't reach it. Constitutional avoidance made them decide that it was easier for them to just say there was State error. Why do we reach a different conclusion? I'm sorry. Why not? If the State court didn't reach the Federal constitutional error, you're asking us to assume it did when you've admitted it didn't? So why do we bother saying in Williams that there are circumstances -- I happen to think this one of them -- where -- and you do, too -- where a State court hasn't reached an issue, that we don't give it deference. Under your judgment, we made a mistake when we said that in Williams. Why do we apply AEDPA at all? Meaning -- I think we've said repeatedly that Brecht's actual prejudice standard is higher than the -- the AEDPA standard. So why are we applying it at all? Well, you've -- you've already admitted there's sort of an illogic when the State court says there was a Federal violation but no harmlessness and we say, ""Yes, there was harm."" So we don't give it deference that there was a Federal error. We don't say it was a reasonable mistake but they found error and we accept the error. We didn't do that in Wiggins, Rompilla, or Porter, did we? So we would have to overturn those cases to accept your proposition. That the State had not addressed? Identical to this case. The State had not addressed one prong, and we said de novo review. I have a bit of a hard time with the -- this -- assume I accept your proposition that it's actual prejudice. In a process claim, generally, we don't talk about what the outcome was going to be. We talk about what the process was and whether there was an opportunity for you to make arguments you couldn't have made. All right? That's our normal jurisprudence in a due process claim. And we basically say you get a do-over because you weren't permitted to have the process you were entitled to. So you're saying we've got to treat this differently under Brecht; this person wasn't permitted to be there. I think there's some very convincing arguments, potentially, on at least one juror, Olanders. There, the comparison was not speculative. It was based on the answers provided by jurors who had both questionnaires and voir dire that was available. And the briefs point out -- and so does the Ninth Circuit, very convincingly -- all the excuses given by the prosecutor are rebutted by either identical answers by one juror, Ana L. -- Ana or Ana L., or other jurors who did exactly the same thing and were permitted to sit on the jury. So why are we doing anything different with this actual prejudice standard? But don't -- don't -- don't talk to me generally. Ana L. said more equivocal things about the death penalty than Olanders D., so did another juror, and they still went on. That's what Olanders D. said, essentially. So did she. He thought -- ""I thought about it and realized I -- I could."" That -- you see the two of them substantially different? One said, ""I thought. I've listened to what the law is. I've done"" -- it's hard for me to imagine how they're substantively different. And do you think that defense counsel wouldn't have been able to point that out to the judge? And, you know, there were a lot of people questioned in this. How many days of voir dire was there? Three weeks of voir dire. Do you suspect that the judge, or think that the judge had clearly in mind every set of questions, and their responses. It's clear he was. I'm not doubting that. But my point is simply, do you think that pointing this out to the judge could not have had a substantial influence on his decision? Because all three prongs, he could have pointed to almost identical comments by other jurors. How can you be confident? I mean, the whole purpose of an adversarial system is so that the other side of an argument is presented to the judge. Was he playing defense attorney too? Is that -- and defense attorney with the same purpose? Then I -- why don't we just have a trial ex parte? Presumably that's what you're arguing. We should have the entire trial ex parte, because the judge can do that. I guess my question is, the Ninth Circuit, at least with this juror -- I'm not talking about the other things, I'm talking about this juror -- as I pointed out earlier, pointed out two situations that were almost identical to the one that the op -- the prosecutor pointed to with this juror. Anna L. also said something that was totally nonresponsive to a question; it was like, ""that's correct,"" rather than answering the question. So you can say with complete confidence that that would never have made a difference to the judge? If he had had a real adversary able to point all of these things out, you're confident the judge would not have made up his mind. That's what you're saying. No, there -- there's a real problem here, you do understand. We're only pointing to the things for which there is a record. There is another component to this, which is that all the other questionnaires and the entire transcript wasn't available. Give an example of a strategy. As that juror. Prosecutor doesn't have to say, it's because of planting of police, the pros -- of planting of evidence is going to be at issue. He could just say, I don't like people who distrust the police. Actually, it's said quite often. Well, we're speculating the judge would not -- that defense attorney remained silent or that defense attorney -- Either way. We would be speculating if defense attorney remained silent, or we'd be speculating that the judge would have ruled the same way. Well, the trial court said that. That's speculation. What the Ninth Circuit did with Olanders B is point to the actual existing record -- -- and show that there were contradictions to -- in the record as it existed. ",you know your your brief confuse me and it take me a while to pull it apart all right i do not know that there be a dispute or at least there be a dispute in the application but really the deference here be give to the harmless error find or purport to have be give so there be no there be no dispute that the court below commit an error mean that the court below do not apply the right standard a factual question the issue i think that you be try to arrive at be under the circumstance of this case that the court also reach the performance prod of strickland and that be really where the dispute be be not it i if we we be to find that it be not a reasonable finding then we would have to reach the first decision so assume that it be unreasonable let us go back to the first issue yes in williams and harrington we have say that if there be multiple claim and the state court just say everything s deny you assume that mean federal and state if the state claim be the same as the federal claim we say they they they we assume they mean the federal claim as well but this be sort of an interesting case because the they say there be constitutional error under state law but they studiously avoid federal say there be one or not under federal law and they dismiss the federal claim just on the harmlessness prong and what the ninth circuit say as i understand they do not reach it constitutional avoidance make them decide that it be easy for them to just say there be state error why do we reach a different conclusion I be sorry why not if the state court do not reach the federal constitutional error you be ask us to assume it do when you have admit it do not so why do we bother say in williams that there be circumstance i happen to think this one of them where and you do too where a state court have not reach an issue that we do not give it deference under your judgment we make a mistake when we say that in williams why do we apply aedpa at all mean i think we have say repeatedly that brecht s actual prejudice standard be high than the the aedpa standard so why be we apply it at all well you have you have already admit there be sort of an illogic when the state court say there be a federal violation but no harmlessness and we say yes there be harm so we do not give it deference that there be a federal error we do not say it be a reasonable mistake but they find error and we accept the error we do not do that in wiggins rompilla or porter do we so we would have to overturn those case to accept your proposition that the state have not address identical to this case the state have not address one prong and we say de novo review i have a bit of a hard time with the this assume i accept your proposition that it be actual prejudice in a process claim generally we do not talk about what the outcome be go to be we talk about what the process be and whether there be an opportunity for you to make argument you could not have make all right that be our normal jurisprudence in a due process claim and we basically say you get a do over because you be not permit to have the process you we be entitle to so you be say we have get to treat this differently under brecht this person be not permit to be there i think there be some very convincing argument potentially on at least one juror olanders there the comparison be not speculative it be base on the answer provide by juror who have both questionnaire and voir dire that be available and the brief point out and so do the ninth circuit very convincingly all the excuse give by the prosecutor be rebut by either identical answer by one juror ana l ana or ana l or other juror who do exactly the same thing and we be permit to sit on the jury so why be we do anything different with this actual prejudice standard but do not do not do not talk to me generally ana l say more equivocal thing about the death penalty than olanders d so do another juror and they still go on that be what olanders d say essentially so do she he think i thought about it and realize i i could that you see the two of them substantially different one say i thought I have listen to what the law be I

Are there any facts that you think a jury could determine here or should determine in this kind of a case, in a tacking case?

What would the jury do with that knowledge? I'm a little confused about that because there is a plethora of quotations from the case law that tacking should be a limited thing and not expansive and the -- his scope point.

2014,"Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Center, Inc.",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Could you tell me, if this is unlike those other cases where we've invoked the Supremacy Clause, what's the basis for those cases? I'm not sure I understand your answer. That's the claim here, that there's a Federal law that is contrary to the State law, and I don't know why you can't look at this as an enforcement action. The State law won't permit these individuals to charge an amount greater than they're willing to pay. So if these doctors or providers wanted to charge more, they would be in violation of State law and would have an enforcement action against them. So, I mean, I don't -- I don't actually see this enforcement -- this enforcement argument that you're making. Well, they could, and then you would come in and say, you violated Federal and State regulation. But you-- --I'm sorry. Then what you're arguing is that unless there's a 1983 claim, there's no cause -- unless there's a private cause of action, there could never be a Supremacy Clause claim. Do they have that right? That's a somewhat ineffective remedy. Let's assume, as inflation is going up constantly, what happens 2 years into the plan when providers can't work for what the State is giving or the State is imposing a tremendous hardship on them, which is happening to a lot of providers who are being underpaid. Where do they go? They can't go to the Federal agency because there's no action to challenge. So what do they do? Mr. Kneedler, you can and I won't interrupt. But then get to why the various cases that we've said there are private causes of action under 1983 would survive because-- --I don't understand why that is. Why is the Spending Clause different than any other provision? That still goes to the merits. But this is forgiving the essence of the Supremacy Clause question. This is about -- you're trying to make it one of is it preempted or is it not. But instead, the Supremacy Clause question is: Do you have a right to ensure that State governments are complying with Federal law, whether it's under the Appointments Clause, whether it's under any provision of the Constitution. Why is it that we should exempt out all Spending Clause cases, because that's what your argument is basically saying, from that kind of enforcement? Who's going to go around when the Federal government doesn't care to ensure that States are, in fact, doing what they promised to do? What do you do-- --Let's assume that I were to accept the former HHS officials' position that these private causes of action are highly important, given the limited resources of the agency. Why couldn't we suggest utilizing the doctrine of primary jurisdiction? Well, I'm not sure what -- “ jurisdiction ”, what that means. Well, this is a Federal law. They're coming in and saying if the State law violates the Federal law. On the merits, they may or may not win. But we keep going back to how is jurisdiction missing. Isn't there a difference in the remedies of the two actions? I mean, you know, when we're talking about a private right of action, we're talking about damages, we're talking about restitution, we're talking about all sorts of things. Here, we're talking just about stopping the State from doing something that's wrong. Isn't that it? All right. May I go back to this -- what you started with earlier. You're okay with the methods and procedures that have been approved for the States setting rates. You're saying they misapplied-- --What exactly are you saying? Because you keep saying, I'm entitled to more money. But what did they do wrong? Right. So you're saying-- --Could I -- but that's really irrelevant -- it's not relevant to -- to your argument. You're saying CMS approved a certain method and procedures for setting the rate. The State didn't follow what CMS required, and -- well, what they agreed to. And as a result of that, the rate was -- the rate they set had nothing to do with the method and procedures that had been set. Doesn't matter whether it's efficient, it doesn't matter what it is. The bottom line is that they were required to follow a certain method and a certain procedure. Am I correct about that? Absolutely. Mr. Piotrowski-- --That's the problem. I mean -- but now we're getting to the merits and it's not before us. Justice Breyer was absolutely right and this answers just -- the Chief Justice's point. The injunction here should have been a simple one: State, come into compliance with the methods. The -- they may have come out to the same number if they had figured it out. Armstrong was the guy they -- who published, but the State didn't accept that number. But they should have done the method and presented the figure to the judge. But that's not what happens here, correct? All right. So maybe there's something wrong with the injunction, but all you were seeking was compliance with Federal law, follow the methods and procedures that CMS approved. So are you agreeing with him that you didn't follow the procedures and methods set out in (30)(A), that you went about it your own way? Let me -- let me go back to -- forget your position, take my hypothetical. You didn't follow the methods and procedures. Who has -- do they have any right to come in on ex -- on an ex parte Young theory-- --and say, moving forward, follow the procedures and set a rate consistent with the methods and procedures that you obligated yourself to do. ",could you tell me if this be unlike those other case where we have invoke the supremacy clause what be the basis for those case I be not sure i understand your answer that be the claim here that there be a federal law that be contrary to the state law and i do not know why you can not look at this as an enforcement action the state law will not permit these individual to charge an amount great than they be willing to pay so if these doctor or provider want to charge more they would be in violation of state law and would have an enforcement action against them so i mean i do not i do

remedy of the two action i mean you know when we be talk about a private right of action we be talk about damage we be talk about restitution we be talk about all sort of thing here we be talk just about stop the state from do something that be wrong be not that it all right may i go back to this what you start with earlier you be okay with the method and procedure that have be approve for the state set rate you be say they misapply what exactly be you say because you keep say I be entitle to more money but what do they do wrong right so you be say could i but that be really irrelevant it be not relevant to to your argument you be say cm approve a certain method and procedure for set the rate the state do not follow what cm require and well what they agree to and as a result of that the rate be the rate they set have nothing to do with the method and procedure that have be set do not matter whether it be efficient it do not matter what it be the bottom line be that they we be require to follow a certain method and a certain procedure be i correct about that absolutely mr piotrowski that be the problem i mean but now we be get to the merit and it be not before us justice breyer be absolutely right and this answer just the chief justice s point the injunction here should have be a simple one state come into compliance with the method the they may have come out to the same number if they have figure it out armstrong be the guy they who publish but the state do not accept that number but they should have do the method and present the figure to the judge but that be not what happen here correct all right so maybe there be something wrong with the injunction but all you we be seek be compliance with federal law follow the method and procedure that cms approve so be you agree with him that you do not follow the procedure and method set out in a that you go about it your own way let me let me go back to forget your position take my hypothetical you do not follow the method and procedure who have do they have any right to come in on ex on an ex parte young theory and say move forward follow the procedure and set a rate consistent with the method and procedure that you obligate yourself to do ,395.63,Roberts Court,"Jan 20, 2015","Richard Armstrong, et al.","Exceptional Child Center, Inc., et al.",14-15,"Oct 2, 2014","Mar 31,

2014,Henderson v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Wasn't he on a futile mission in this circuit? Because this circuit had already ruled that any kind of sale by anyone was prohibited, because he was a felon. And when he went up on appeal, he cited the Brown case to the court -- to the circuit court, which had held that a court-ordered sale was okay. And despite him citing the Brown case, the Eighth Circuit continued with its own precedent and said no one can sell it, not even the court. I'm sorry, would you repeat that? I think Justice Alito's question is basically why would the district court have equitable power to turn down any named buyer so long as it is an actual buyer. Meaning I can understand he can't just designate someone who's himself, okay, but if he's making a good faith sale, why should the district court have any power to turn that person down? Well, the reality is -- The reality is that the world is not going to know the guns are there, so -- but there's no exclusion. If I wanted to go into that case and ask the court to consider me rather than the nominee, it's a court of equity. And the court could say I'm the better owner than the person they nominated. So I don't know what this -- why this nomination becomes control over the sale if it's the judge who's approving the sale. Well, you're saying the court is the one who decides whether the person who's nominated is appropriate or not. But the same trap that you're -- I'm a little bit upset at your brief, frankly, because in that circuit, he couldn't know that there was any permissible sale, because that circuit had said none. And so to come back and say to us that we should leave it in their discretion as to whether it should go to a -- a Federal -- a federally licensed firearms dealer seems as if the government has set a trap for a pro se litigant. But you have to file for forfeiture in those situations. Mr. Ortiz, you do understand -- I thought it was clear from what the government said earlier, that it's waived any claim -- that you waived the request for this relief. So that's not at issue. You think there's still -- -- they're going to go back down and say that you're not entitled to the relief because you didn't ask for the right relief? ",be not he on a futile mission in this circuit because this circuit have already rule that any kind of sale by anyone be prohibit because he be a felon and when he go up on appeal he cite the brown case to the court to the circuit court which have hold that a court order sale be okay and despite him cite the brown case the eighth circuit continue with its own precedent and say no one can sell it not even the court I be sorry would you repeat that i think justice alito s question be basically why would the district court have equitable power to turn down any name buyer so long as it be an actual buyer mean i can understand he can not just designate someone who be himself okay but if he be make a good faith sale why should the district court have any power to turn that person down well the reality be the reality be that the world be not go to know the gun be there so but there be no exclusion if i want to go into that case and ask the court to consider me rather than the nominee it be a court of equity and the court could say I be the good owner than the person they nominate so i do not know what this why this nomination become control over the sale if it be the judge who be approve the sale well you be say the court be the one who decide whether the person who be nominate be appropriate or not but the same trap that you be I be a little bit upset at your brief frankly because in that circuit he could not know that there be any permissible sale because that circuit have say none and so to come back and say to us that we should leave it in their discretion as to whether it should go to a a federal a federally licensed firearm dealer seem as if the government have set a trap for a pro se litigant but you have to file for forfeiture in those situation mr ortiz you do understand i think it be clear from what the government say earlier that it be waive any claim that you waive the request for this relief so that be not at issue you think there be still they be go to go back down and say that you be not entitle to the relief because you do not ask for the right relief ,167.81000000000003,Roberts Court,"Feb 24, 2015",Tony Henderson,United States,13-1487,"Oct 20, 2014","May 18, 2015",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2014,Kingsley v. Hendrickson,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I'm sorry. Why is anybody -- I'm having a problem with trying to understand why we're talking about a difference between any of the Amendments, the Fourth, the Fourteenth, or the Eighth. The cruel and unusual punishment, I thought, was generally -- generally applicable to the sentence a prisoner receives. That's very different than to the application of -- of force separate from the -- from the sentence. We're talking about whether and under what circumstances a prison guard or a prison is liable for using unnecessary force on another person. I don't think that taking any prisoner and for no reason -- arbitrary reason banging his head on the wall because you think that'll send the message to other prisoners would be acceptable, do you, under any of the Amendments? All right. So I -- I just don't quite understand the difference. I think the issue is one, how -- how you instruct the jury. And the government is saying you instruct the jury by saying you have a subjective intent to punish the prisoner -- you just want to beat him up; or you're inflicting harm that's not necessary or reasonable for a legitimate penological reason, correct? Do you have a different standard than the government? All right. Then yours is broader. And explain why. Why is the government standard not good enough? That I -- I understand. I'm just talking about the standard now. I still go back to my question: Why is there a difference at all? What you seem to be suggesting is that gratuitous violence, unnecessary violence, can be directed to pretrial and post-trial detainees. Isn't your objection that unreasonable, unnecessary force is not permissible? Why are we giving a license to prison guards to use unreasonable or unnecessary force -- -- against anybody? But they can't be punished corporally. They can be denied good credit -- good time credit. Do you think we could put them -- you can knock them against the wall as punishment? Not -- not in terms of discipline. It may be that some matter, immediate need justifies that action, but are you suggesting that as punishment they could do it for unnecessary force? Unnecessary, not punishment -- or even punishment. They -- they looked -- they -- they said the -- a bad word to the prison officer. Can I -- Can I -- I'm still struggling because we're trying to create boxes in a way that makes no sense to me. There are all sorts of reasons for doing things, and the Eighth Amendment cases that we have, have to do with punishment qua not bringing control, not responding to a prison outbreak, or a fight, or anything else, but the types of conditions that are imposed on prisoners as punishment, i.e., you've broken an administrative rule, and now we're going to put you in shackles in the dark dungeon. We've already said in one case you can't do that. You may subjectively and legitimately think that that will keep you constrained, but that's too far. It's not -- it's unwanted and unnecessarily cruel and unusual. All right? But that's very different than this situation. Whether it's a pretrial detainee or post-trial detainee, I don't think the Constitution gives you a free pass to punish a prisoner by inflicting unwanted corporal punishment. I'm not talking about the conditions of -- of punishment; i.e., good time credit, solitary confinement, segregation of some sort, deprivation of a prison job you have. That, clearly, you need an Eighth Amendment, sort of subjective intent element. I'm talking about the use of force for purposes of restoring discipline. That's what this was about, wasn't it? So I keep saying why are we thinking about the necessity to impose subjective standards or any other standards or that they have to be different? I'm even not sure why that's right. Why -- you get a free -- the Constitution permits you to get a free kick in? So if you walk by a prisoner and, you know, I want to establish discipline so I can freely kick them any time I want? Well, let's put the nub of the issue here. Let me give you the fact -- let's use this actual situation. The -- the defendant says, I wasn't resisting, I wasn't spreading my arms apart, I was just laying there, and they came and Tased me. All right. The officers say instead he was pulling his arms and resisting it so we couldn't get the handcuffs open. So assuming a jury credits the Petitioner, what would that do under -- how would that be evaluated under your test? Let's go back to -- that's why I keep trying to go back to what is the -- what are the -- under what circumstances and how does your test get to the gratuitous use of violence or the excessive use of violence where it's unnecessary? But that instruction is going to be given anyway. Under -- under the Bell v. Wolfish case, that presumption was given anyhow. But you're giving -- you're -- you're loading the deck completely, because you're instructing the jury first to give the police officers deference, and then you're now giving them an instruction that assumes that whatever they do is okay. I mean, there's no -- there's -- by adding that kind of subjective intent that you want, maliciousness and wantonness, which are not -- are only one part, as your -- as the Assistant Solicitor General said, only one part of the Johnson test. You're -- you're -- the way you've articulated in your brief has really loaded the deck completely. Bell v. -- Bell v. Wolfish, the first part of the application section of that opinion goes to whether there's an intent to punish. It assumes there's not, and then it goes to the objective test and says, in that particular case, that the conditions met that -- those conditions as well, but it treated it as alternative. That's -- ",I be sorry why be anybody I be have a problem with try to understand why we be talk about a difference between any of the amendment the fourth the fourteenth or the eighth the cruel and

2014,Wellness International Network v. Sharif,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"But we've already held that a fraudulent conveyance against a noncreditor is an Article III violation, is a Stern claim, essentially. Or non-Stern claim. So why isn't this the same thing? I mean, it's not the same thing because he actually possessed this trust, it's in his name as trustee-- --and so it's a little bit -- it's a lot different, but-- --Oh, but -- but that's the same in a fraudulent conveyance. It was his property and he was just trying to deny his other creditors the benefit of that money. So it's not quite that. But here, he's claiming that the beneficiary has title. Would the court, the bankruptcy court, have had the power to notify her or to subpoena her to come in as a party? Because she's the representative. Right. But you've not explored the question completely. Basically the argument that the SG and the -- of you and the SG is that you need express consent -- or I guess the other side, saying you need express consent and they didn't give express consent. How do you get around that? There is a problem, however, here, and that problem is that Stern wasn't decided until the appeal. On rebuttal, I want to talk about the American Colleges' appellate waiver argument. But that's too broad an answer, because that would be true of fraudulent conveyances. How about a simpler rule, if you have legal title to something? If you -- if you possess it physically or you have legal title to it, then the bankruptcy court can determine. They -- he has -- the trustee had legal title. He's just claiming-- --that there's an equitable requirement to hold it for someone else. Yeah. I'm trying to get away from the-- --I'm trying to get away from the augmentation argument because it's really difficult to apply in a case like this. Anything that's in the estate augments it or anything that comes into the estate. Well, then-- --Well, tell me why my rule is not simpler. If you -- if you physically possess it at the time you declare bankruptcy or you have legal title to it-- --then the bankruptcy -- then it's not a Stern claim. In Stern we said we would look to history. In Stern we said we would look to history. So let's to go -- let's go to the hypothetical. The sister holds title, but you're saying that it belonged to him. That she holds legal title but, in fact, she -- it's really his money. That really begs the question, your client possessed something and he says it really belonged to someone else. Don't you have to decide who it belongs to if there is no clear indication of it? I mean, there may be a clear one, but it still begs the question. Just to clarify the record, I asked the question whether they were or weren't. Well, we've said that, too, against-- --So give me examples. The suggested rule that I have for the solicitor general, which he would like the broader one, but if at the time you have legal title to or in physical possession of something, then it's not a Stern claim, not an Article III claim because that is the quintessential question that bankruptcy judges decide are the things that you possess either by title or by constructive holding -- or by holding. By the way, is are the arguments you're raising now any different as applied to magistrate judges? If we rule in your favor in this case, are we calling into question our -- our acceptance of magistrate judge positions? So your answer is yes, because you can do -- on express consent, you can do reports and recommendations. I agree, but we didn't say that you couldn't consent in Schor. No, consent is enough for arbitration, and there you give up 18-- --No, because that's what happens in arbitration. You're agreeing to the entry of a judgment, of an award. Perhaps not even, because you don't even put that into the contract. Congress is saying, we're going to do it anyway. Could you spend a moment just talking about the forfeited argument on appeal? The -- the argument that consent can be presumed from your forfeiture of the argument on appeal. ",but we have already hold that a fraudulent conveyance against a noncreditor be an article iii violation be a stern claim essentially or non stern claim so why be not this the same thing i mean it be not the same thing because he actually possess this trust it be in his name as trustee and so it be a little bit it be a lot different but oh but but that be the same in a fraudulent conveyance it be his property and he be just try to deny his other creditor the benefit of that money so it be not quite that but here he have claim that the beneficiary have title would the court the bankruptcy court have have the power to notify her or to subpoena her to come in as a party because she be the representative right but you have not explore the question completely basically the argument that the sg and the of you and the sg be that you need express consent or i guess the other side say you need express consent and they do not give express consent how do you get around that there be a problem however here and that problem be that stern be not decide until the appeal on rebuttal i want to talk about the american college appellate waiver argument but that be too broad an answer because that would be true of fraudulent conveyance how about a simpler rule if you have legal title to something if you if you possess it physically or you have legal title to it then the bankruptcy court can determine they he have the trustee have legal title he be just claim that there be an equitable requirement to hold it for someone else yeah I be try to get away from the I be try to get away from the augmentation argument because it be really difficult to apply in a case like this anything that be in the estate augment it or anything that come into the estate well then well tell me why my rule be not simple if you if you physically possess it at the time you declare bankruptcy or you have legal title to it then the bankruptcy then it be not a stern claim in stern we say we would look to history in stern we say we would look to history so let us to go let us go to the hypothetical the sister hold title but you be say that it belong to him that she hold legal title but in fact she it be really his money that really beg the question your client possess something and he say it really belong to someone else do not you have to decide who it belong to if there be no clear indication of it i mean there may be a clear one but it still beg the question just to clarify the record i ask the question whether they we be or be not well we have say that too against so give me example the suggested rule that i have for the solicitor general which he would like the broad one but if at the time you have legal title to or in physical possession of something then it be not a stern claim not an article iii claim because that be the quintessential question that bankruptcy judge decide be the thing that you possess either by title or by constructive holding or by hold by the way be be the argument you be raise now any different as apply to magistrate judge if we rule in your favor in this case be we call into question our our acceptance of magistrate judge position so your answer be yes because you can do on express consent you can do report and recommendation i agree but we do not say that you could not consent in schor no consent be enough for arbitration and there you give up no because that be what happen in arbitration you be agree to the entry of a judgment of an award perhaps not even because you do not even put that into the contract congress be say we be go to do it anyway could you spend a moment just talk about the forfeited argument on appeal the the argument that consent can be presume from your forfeiture of the argument on appeal ,253.28,Roberts Court,"Jan 14, 2015","Wellness International Network, Ltd., et al.",Richard Sharif,13-935,"Jul 1, 2014","May 26, 2015",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2014,Heien v. North Carolina,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I don't know why, following up on what Justice Scalia is saying, he's saying we don't give you a remedy unless we believe that one is warranted under the Fourth Amendment. And since we apply -- it doesn't matter what North Carolina applies, good faith or not -- what we apply in terms of determining whether a Federal violation or a constitutional violation is subject to any type of remedy for you is the good-faith exception. So why do we have to remand? I think that's just Justice Scalia's question and I'm not quite sure you've answered it. When will we ever get an understanding, the right understanding of the law? Meaning as I read the North Carolina Supreme Court decision, it still hasn't told me whether it's one or two brake lights, and the next police officer who wants to stop someone won't know that either. Now, he may be bound by the appellate court decision, but that won't help clarify the state of the law. Isn't what you're doing going to leave the criminal law unclear? It's one thing to say that you want to not subject officers to civil liability. It's another to say you want to leave the law unclear in a criminal prosecution. Well, it will for the appellate decision if it's now taking your view that it can just find out whether the reading, the officer's reading of the law is reasonable. It basically means that any open question, police officers will rule in favor of their right to search. Define what would make it unreasonable? There is a problem, however -- I'm sorry. The police officer wasn't stopping him because of the brake light. The police officer was involved in criminal interdictions and admitted that this was a pretext, a lawful pretext, he thought. So he wasn't there just to tell him -- if he had just stopped him and said, you know, fix your brake light, and drove away, there would never be a lawsuit, correct? So how many citizens have been stopped for one brake light who are asked to have their car searched? And is that something that we as a society should be encouraging? What kind of mistake of law did the police officer make in DeFillippo? The law said exactly what he thought it said. Why do you classify this as a mistake of law question? We said it was presumptively valid and he acted according to a statute. You don't ask police officers to ignore the law. No, no, no. This is a mistake of law; he wasn't following the law, presumably, according to the appellate decision. Are all the cases that you cite, including Riddle, all in the context of a customs statute that didn't permit customs officers to suffer damages-- --for purposes of an error of law, correct? None of those cases involved a violation of the Fourth Amendment. But how is that different in terms of its analysis, those cases, from what we've ultimately applied as a qualified immunity standard with respect to civil damages today? Doesn't it follow -- don't they follow exactly the same reason? So you disagree with Justice Story when he looked at those cases and made the point I just made. Do you think he was wrong? How is your standard differed from qualified immunity standard of reasonableness? ",i do not know why follow up on what justice scalia be say he be say we do not give you a remedy unless we believe that one be warrant under the fourth amendment and since we apply it do not matter what north carolina applies good faith or not what we apply in term of determine whether a federal violation or a constitutional violation be subject to any type of remedy for you be the good faith exception so why do we have to remand i think that be just justice scalia s question and I be not quite sure you have answer it when will we ever get an understanding the right understanding of the law meaning as i read the north carolina supreme court decision it still have not tell me whether it be one or two brake light and the next police officer who want to stop someone will not know that either now he may be bind by the appellate court decision but that will not help clarify the state of the law be not what you be do go to leave the criminal law unclear it be one thing to say that you want to not subject officer to civil liability it be another to say you want to leave the law unclear in a criminal prosecution well it will for the appellate decision if it be now take your view that it can just find out whether the reading the officer s reading of the law be reasonable it basically mean that any open question police officer will rule in favor of their right to search define what would make it unreasonable there be a problem however I be sorry the police officer be not stop him because of the brake light the police officer be involve in criminal interdiction and admit that this be a pretext a lawful pretext he think so he be not there just to tell him if he have just stop him and say you know fix your brake light and drive away there would never be a lawsuit correct so how many citizen have be stop for one brake light who be ask to have their car search and be that something that we as a society should be encourage what kind of mistake of law do the police officer make in defillippo the law say exactly what he think it say why do you classify this as a mistake of law question we say it be presumptively valid and he act accord to a statute you do not ask police officer to ignore the law no no no this be a mistake of law he be not follow the law presumably accord to the appellate decision be all the case that you cite include riddle all in the context of a custom statute that do not permit custom officer to suffer damage for purpose of an error of law correct none of those case involve a violation of the fourth amendment but how be that different in term of its analysis those case from what we have ultimately apply as a qualified immunity standard with respect to civil damage today do not it follow do not they follow exactly the same reason so you disagree with justice story when he look at those case and make the point i just make do you think he be wrong how be your standard differ from qualify immunity standard of reasonableness ,219.33,Roberts Court,"Oct 6, 2014",Nicholas B.

2014,"Walker v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans, Inc.",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"But, I'm sorry. I don't understand. Almost anything the government does, it has final authority to veto. Whether it's a school or a government website, it always retains the authority to say no. The issue is when can it say no constitutionally. So I don't think it's merely that. And in Summum, the government actually created the words that were -- that were being advertised. So isn't that substantially different? Because the government's not creating these words. That's the monument case. I'm talking about Johanns. I really don't think that you've answered Justice Alito's question. In every park you need, generally, a permit to do certain kinds of speech. So the government controls that permit process, and it tells you that it can say no. So why is that different in the situations that -- it can't be merely control is what I'm saying. The ability to veto because that would then give you the ability to veto. You could create a program in every public forum that basically controls in the same way. Now, don't try a general rule. I think the Justice is asking you for a specific. Why would you -- There's a lot of money in this, isn't it? It's about $8,000? Is it about $8,000 to get one of these plates? More than that. I have -- I -- I have a different question, which is -- I actually do think that this is hybrid speech. It's both government and the individual speaking at the same time. But that goes back to what Justice Scalia said. In Wooley we said we can't compel the individual to put something on their license plates that they disagree with. So why isn't the reverse true for the government? If you're going to ask me to put my name, because the law requires it, the State's name on a license plate, why can you compel us to do something we don't want to endorse? Why shouldn't it work both ways when it's -- But how -- how do I know which is the government's and which is only the individual's? I mean, I -- I -- I wouldn't have known that pro -- that -- that pro anything was sponsored by some States and not others, or endorsed by some States but not others. So how do I know that a particular license plate the government doesn't endorse? Well, that implies a certain degree of approval. My -- my problem with this is, how do I know? There are three categories of plates, I understand. There's the official State plate, there are specialty plates created by the legislature, and there are specialty plates created by an individual. How do I tell the difference between the legislative plates, which are government speech, and the private plates? Do I need to? What I do know is what I said at the beginning, it's both people speaking. And I think both people endorsing each other's message in some way. So why should the government be compelled to accept speech it rejects because it thinks it's wrong? And doesn't want to be associated with directly. Where is that going to fit on the license plate? Where is that going to fit on the license plate? (Laughter.) ",but I be sorry i do not understand almost anything the government do it have final authority to veto whether it be a school or a government website it always retain the authority to say no the issue be when can it say no constitutionally so i do not think it be merely that and in summum the government actually create the word that we be that we be be advertise so be not that substantially different because the government s not create these word that be the monument case I be talk about johanns i really do not think that you have answer justice alito s question in every park you need generally a permit to do certain kind of speech so the government control that permit process and it tell you that it can say no so why be that different in the situation that it can not be merely control be what I be say the ability to veto because that would then give you the ability to veto you could create a program in every public forum that basically control in the same way now do not try a general rule i think the justice be ask you for a specific why would you there be a lot of money in this be not it it be about be it about to get one of these plate more than that i have i i have a different question which be i actually do think that this be hybrid speech it be both government and the individual speaking at the same time but that go back to what justice scalia say in wooley we say we can not compel the individual to put something on their license plat that they disagree with so why be not the reverse true for the government if you be go to ask me to put my name because the law require it the state s name on a license plate why can you compel us to do something we do not want to endorse why should not it work both way when it be but how how do i know which be the government s and which be only the individual s i mean i i i would not have know that pro that that pro anything be sponsor by some state and not others or endorse by some state but not others so how do i know that a particular license plate the government do not endorse well that imply a certain degree of approval my my problem with this be how do i know there be three category of plate i understand there be the official state plate there be specialty plate create by the legislature and there be specialty plate create by an individual how do i tell the difference between the legislative plate which be government speech and the private plate do i need to what i do know be what i say at the beginning it be both people speaking and i think both people endorse each other s message in some way so why should the government be compel to accept speech it reject because it think it be wrong and do not want to be associate with directly where be that go to fit on the license plate where be that go to fit on the license plate laughter ,220.95999999999992,Roberts Court,"Mar 23, 2015","John Walker, III, et al.","Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans, Inc., et al.",14-144,"Dec 5, 2014","Jun 18, 2015",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2014,Elonis v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Can you tell me -- I'm sorry. Go ahead. Could you tell me -- I'm coming a little bit off of Justice Ginsburg's question. You can infer what a person's state of mind is from the circumstances of how and what was said in words, correct? So if that's the case, isn't the jury acting like a reasonable person in looking at the words and the circumstances and saying, did he intend this or didn't he? I mean, I don't know what the difference between the standard given and the one -- the instruction you want. But -- I mean, how is that different from what you intend? If you know if a reasonable person is going to read these words this way, aren't they going to assume that's what the defendant intended? Are you quarreling with Justice Breyer? Obviously, you are. Why are you -- why are you quarreling? It's not enough for you for us to say a true threat is when you intend to put another person-- --in fear-- --or you know that your words will cause a reasonable person to feel fear. You are quarreling with that formulation. You want something broader. So the drunken person who says I don't know what I was saying, is he or she guilty? You've just made a wonderful closing statement, but -- a summation. But why is the instruction that -- or any of the formulations suggested here going to harm them? Well, let's go to that question. It may have been Congress's intent, but does the First Amendment provide an umbrella that cabins their intent? We've been loathe to create more exceptions to the First Amendment. I don't know where in the common law you have found a -- a hook to say that we should create this as another exception.

2014,Reyes Mata v. Lynch,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Now, I've -- I've forgotten, but is there a circuit split on that third -- on the sua sponte review? Well, I'm -- I'm a little concerned because we do have to, on some levels, address the question of whether a sua -- sua sponte decision not to -- not to reopen is -- is reviewable. I -- I think as a general matter, one could say that given the vast discretion that the BIA gets in denying, that one should basically defer to their decisions in sua sponte reopenings. But occasionally, they do it not as an exercise of discretion, but as an erroneous interpretation of law. And there's plenty of standards to correcting that. And so even for me, in sua sponte openings -- and I do understand I'm probably on a losing slope -- and I think that's what the -- the board is basically saying. It's a matter of -- of deciding whether there was ineffective assistance of counsel, and we have a right and this is the standard we're going to set. Lozada sets the standard that we're going to look at, and for that reason, there is equitable tolling. That's basically all they're saying, in my judgment. You're right. How it -- but here, they basically said it -- you didn't have due diligence, I believe, and so you failed the prerequisites. I'm sorry. I'm totally confused. I -- I think what the agency is saying, at least in this situation, is there is no explicit command in the statute about equitable tolling. There is a time limit in the statute. But can it be tolled or not? There's no explicit command in the statute it can't. And so as a matter of procedure, which generally we give a huge amount of deference to the agency, it has, albeit in unpublished opinions, followed a practice of considering it in motions to reopen. And from that practice, they're telling us, there is, because the agency has determined that, with respect to IAC claims, that they will do it. I don't actually see that much problem with the problem, but I do agree with Justice Breyer that we don't need to get to that question here, because we really don't know whether that's the view of the Fifth Circuit or not. And if they find it or if they say it doesn't exist, I want to consider their reasons. That's what we usually do. But they haven't really given us reasons, other than to say the statute requires it, but I don't see why. That's -- that's -- ",now I have I have forget but be there a circuit split on that third on the sua sponte review well I be I be a little concerned because we do have to on some level address the question of whether a sua sua sponte decision not to not to reopen be be reviewable i i think as a general matter one could say that give the vast discretion that the bia get in denying that one should basically defer to their decision in sua sponte reopenings but occasionally they do it not as an exercise of discretion but as an erroneous interpretation of law and there be plenty of standard to correct that and so even for me in sua sponte opening and i do understand I be probably on a losing slope and i think that be what the the board be basically say it be a matter of of decide whether there be ineffective assistance of counsel and we have a right and this be the standard we be go to set lozada set the standard that we be go to look at and for that reason there be equitable tolling that be basically all they be say in my judgment you be right how it but here they basically say it you do not have due diligence i believe and so you fail the prerequisite I be sorry I be totally confused i i think what the agency be say at least in this situation be there be no explicit command in the statute about equitable tolling there be a time limit in the statute but can it be toll or not there be no explicit command in the statute it can not and so as a matter of procedure which generally we give a huge amount of deference to the agency it have albeit in unpublished opinion follow a practice of consider it in motion to reopen and from that practice they be tell us there be because the agency have determine that with respect to iac claim that they will do it i do not actually see that much problem with the problem but i do agree with justice breyer that we do not need to get to that question here because we really do not know whether that be the view of the fifth circuit or not and if they find it or if they say it do not exist i want to consider their reason that be what we usually do but they have not really give us reason other than to say the statute require it but i do not see why that be that be ,192.36,Roberts Court,"Apr 29, 2015",Noel Reyes Mata,"Loretta Lynch, Attorney General of the United States",14-185,"Jan 16, 2015","Jun 15, 2015",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2014,Williams-Yulee v. The Florida Bar,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Could I go back to judicial dignity coercion. It's very, very, very rare that either by letter or by personal call that I ask a lawyer to do something, whether it's serve on a committee, help organize something, do whatever it is that I'm asking, that that lawyer will say no. Isn't it inherent in the lawyer-judge context that people are going to say yes. Well, I-- --Because she was unknown. But I'm talking about this -- this is -- this prohibition is dealing with an issue that does happen in the vast majority of cases. Well-- --that's -- that's what you think, but I can actually see how receiving a signed letter from the judge saying, give, and -- or a telephone call or a personal meeting has an incrementally greater impact than a letter. I get -- even today I get a whole lot of campaign committee letters, and I just throw them out. If -- if a candidate calls me or reaches out to me, I tell them I can't talk to them and I can't give, okay, but I have a reason and an excuse. A lawyer doesn't have that reason or excuse. So why is-- --Isn't the proof of the pudding in what Justice Breyer is saying in the statistics? One of the briefs mentioned that those candidates who can fund-raise personally do appreciably better in collecting money than the candidates who have to go through a committee. So what would be the difference, other than the fact that there is some form of personal coercion in the presence of the judge asking for the money? Well, that's the point, isn't it?

That's not-- --I'm sorry, your -- your opposite party did make the point that the legislative process presumes influence and presumes coercion, putting the arm on people to help you get into office to maintain a position that you've promised you'd maintain.

2014,City of Los Angeles v. Patel,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Could you -- first, two questions: Is the information that they've been keeping for 150 years the same? Because looking at the requirements, the early information was basically somebody's name and -- I'm not even sure -- their address. But today's information has -- or today's registry and requirements have information that Federal law doesn't permit to be disclosed, like driver's license, credit card information. I mean, Federal law says you can't disclose that information. So isn't there a difference? It's not the same tradition over 150 years. Right. All of the things that you say, the most effective tool for trafficking, prostitution, child molestation, none of that sounds like it's -- the purpose of the search is administrative. Can you tell me how many prosecutions there have been -- and I use the word both criminally or civil -- for the failure to register people? But that has nothing to do with the free right to search. Those people who are refusing to do it are going to refuse to do it. A recordkeeping requirement has no -- has no constitutional challenge. What does is the unfettered access to that record. Those people who don't want to do it are not going to do it anyway. Sure. Why? I mean, what you're saying is it's easier to prosecute, but it doesn't mean that you can't devote some resources and find this out. You do a surveillance which is what police do for a lot of crimes. And you watch people going in for two hours and leaving, and you keep a record of it. You can even stop those people who are leaving to ask them. So there's a whole lot of law enforcement techniques that could be used to combat the situations you're talking about. Well, since when has the Fourth Amendment completely been abandoned to how effective the proof that the police can get at a moment should be? I don't know that -- Who -- How about the hiring -- I don't know why not. Checking to see if people are actually registered, you don't know that until you see a person working. So you've got a construction site. You count the number of people; and you say, let me see your recordkeeping for your employees today. That's a realtime need. You just -- You just keep a register -- you falsify the register the way that you're saying these people would. I -- my problem with the closely held -- closely regulated is I don't see one regulation that's not applicable to virtually every public accommodation entity, whether it's a telephone company or a day school or a hospital. I mean, virtually all of these requirements that you list are part of the normal State regulation of entities that serve people. Is it your position now that once we say this is closely regulated, that everything is -- -- that serves the public in some way? I'm sorry. You're saying that if a police officer stands outside a house and says, bring me whatever it is I want from inside, and he brings it out, that's not a violation of the Fourth Amendment because he, under compulsion, tells the person you have to bring me what's inside, because I can't enter under the Fourth Amendment. So that's the point. I don't think -- I don't see why we've ever required more. All we've required is a person to say, this is my business record. And why do they have to prove more? What -- what are they suppose to prove, that they don't use -- that they don't show it to anyone else? We've never required that. Well, there is today when the Federal law requires that you not disclose credit card information and driver's license information and these registries contain that information. So you can't have it both ways. The registries -- -- by law are required to have the driver's license information taken for people who are paying cash -- -- and requires the credit card information of people who are otherwise registering. I -- I think it's even more dangerous. Look at almost how many businesses, retail businesses transact their recordkeeping in public areas. Talk about any shop in the country. They don't go to the back, virtually any of them, and transact their business, keep their credit card information. They put it right on the computer in front of them. So, I mean -- So it can't be that merely ask -- intruding on someone's private information, in a public place eliminates the Fourth Amendment. I'm sorry. I thought the stronger answer would be we've always looked at a lack of procedural protection under a facial challenge -- We did. Exactly. So anytime that the challenge as to the lack of process -- -- we've looked at it, facially it was applied or whatever, but it doesn't need to be as applied. I'm still very confused about this. There is always a potential exception to a warrant, even a Fourth Amendment warrant of going into the home, exigent circumstances, there's someone sick on the other side, if there's a fleeing felon into the place, but that doesn't eliminate the need for a warrant. It's not a tell-us-later issue. Police can't just keep going in and then fish around for an excuse. That's a process issue. You're entitled to a warrant, you're entitled to a subpoena, you're entitled -- that's what they're challenging, which is they're not challenging all of the other reasons why the police could go in legitimately -- -- as an exception to the Fourth Amendment. They're asking whether this kind of search, generally, without all of those other exigent circumstances or other Fourth Amendment exceptions is constitutional. Is the process here right. You know something, but that's a different issue. It's in the public. And how often do you think that's going to happen? ",could you first two question be the information that they have be keep for year the same because look at the requirement the early information be basically somebody s name and I be not even sure

Like Justice Ginsburg, I thought from the briefing that that was done generally beforehand, that something would be distributed to people with a confidential notice on it so that people would be-- --that the -- that this was SSI. But this particular information wasn't so designated before the release. You want it before it's going out. Counsel, would you qualify, assuming -- because Congress disagreed with Robertson and -- didn't it? And it then amended FOIA. All right. Assume that we read statute more or less the way that FOIA does-- --the amended FOIA. Do you meet the amended FOIA criteria? All right. And which prong of it and why? It seems to be eminently reasonable despite Robertson. I mean, but that's basically what you're arguing, is that -- one of the two FOIA exceptions. So tell me which one. Yours is, I think, a little bit more specific than that. Mr. Katyal, if the statute read, ""Disclosure of information detrimental to transportation safety is prohibited and the TSA shall promulgate regulations to that effect. "" would that be pursuant to law under the statute? And That's what I want to know. How specific does -- are we going to get to a point where Congress has to look at every category of information every agency deals with and make a law prohibiting the disclosure of that individually? Do you have any doubt that the -- that -- make the argument that the disclosure of this information didn't potentially harm transportation safety? So are you saying that this statute is not specific enough for a FOIA request? If someone under FOIA had come in and asked for this information, they could have gotten it? So you want us to de-couple FOIA from this. It would be okay under FOIA for the agent to withhold this information? Because you think it's -- that you think it's -- that particular types of matter to be withheld. You agree with the government that that includes this kind of material. I'm troubled because the facts are very much in your favor here, because he disclosed it publicly, but under your scenario or under your position, if he published every day until the executive order came out the schedule of which flights air marshals will be on and he would come out and just say, I think we need more air marshals, that would be -- that would not be a violation. They couldn't fire him for that. Excuse me. Then you would say that under FOIA -- I mean, assuming I follow Justice Breyer's approach -- you would be leading to the conclusion that the government -- if a FOIA request is made, the government has to disclose it because it doesn't -- because it's not -- the -- the statute is not referring to a particular type of matter to be withheld. It's not particular enough for you. Just answer my question. You're saying the government couldn't withhold it under FOIA?

2014,Glossip v. Gross,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Could you -- the way I've thought of this -- and I know that in your brief you think de novo review goes to everything. If I disagree with you, if I think that I have to give deference to the district court's factual finding on how this drug works, the -- how do you call it -- the -- Midazolam, but that it's a legal question of whether how that drug works creates a risk of harm that's constitutionally intolerable. Is that how you divide up the legal end? So the facts are now. Now let's go to my real question, okay? That a judge ignores evidence is not necessarily an abuse of discretion or a clear error. But -- so what are the clear errors in terms of the reasoning that the district court used? Do you even have to go that far? The State here doesn't even propose that their doctor was right on this point. They're not defending it, they don't say it's true. They -- I -- conceded, as I read their brief, that it does not work the way the doctor said it worked, that it does not paralyze the brain, correct? So it's clear error. Now we've got an admission that the expert was plainly wrong. So how -- what else, I guess -- there was nothing else that the district court could have based its conclusion on, correct? Well, the one proof we do have is the Wood execution, not the one that was botched, but Mr. Wood was given 750 milligrams, correct? And he laid writhing in pain for 20 minutes? 25 minutes? I don't remember how long. I'm sorry, 2 hours. Now, there's been some defense that the 750 wasn't immediately delivered, but it was still 750 that went into his system and caused that kind of pain, correct? Counselor, I -- Counsel, if there is no -- There are other ways to kill people regrettably. That are painless. It doesn't have to be a drug protocol that we elect that has a substantial risk of burning a person alive who's paralyzed, correct? I know that you'll get up and argue that those other ways are -- are not constitutional either potentially, but people do that with every protocol. But the little bit of research I've done has shown that the reason people don't use the other methods it's because it offends them to look at them. Like you could use gas, that renders people not even knowing that they're going to sleep to die. And people probably don't want to use that protocol because of what happened during World War II. But there are alternatives. Oklahoma has found some. It's -- it can use the -- a firing squad now. So I don't know what the absence of a drug, what pertinence it has when alternatives exist. What -- what's the -- I -- I have a real problem with whatever you're reading, because I'm going to have to go back to that article. I am substantially disturbed that in your brief you made factual statements that were not supported by the cited -- of those sources and in fact directly contradicted. I'm going to give you just three small examples among many I found. So nothing you say or read to me am I going to believe, frankly, until I see it with my own eyes the context, okay? I'll give you a -- the three examples. On pages 4 and 5 of your brief you cite, ""This drug's FDA approved label as holding that"" -- ""that this drug can get you to mild sedation and to deep levels of sedation virtually equivalent to the state of general anesthesia where the patient may require external support for vital functions."" But this quote was not on general use. This quote came from the section of the FDA label where it was saying that this drug's effects, when taken with other drugs that suppress the central nervous system, this can happen. That to me is -- really there is no other central nervous system drug at play in this protocol. On page 6, you cite the -- No, sir. Go -- But you didn't -- you quoted this for the proposition that it could cause a fatality because of the depression of -- or it could produce general anesthesia. Sure, but he said it's in old people. I'm -- you know, there have been 80 deaths from therapeutic doses of this drug. It's -- this is almost like you saying because 80 people have died from the use of one aspirin, that means that if I give people 100 aspirins, they're going to die. It's just not logical. Obviously, people die from anything that you give them, that's why there are hospital fatalities in every procedure and why there's -- that -- but 80 among the millions that are given this drug don't die. So my point is, what -- the FDA is saying the general anesthesia effect is only going to happen when you have a central nervous drug -- central nervous system drug. Well, they put it in that section. Exactly. All right. Let me give you a second example: The Melvin study. The Melvin study says this is how it happened. It gave this drug in doses of .02 to .06, and what it showed was that at .06 dose, there was less effect than at .02. And he said, this suggests that there is a ceiling effect to this drug and that it is less potent as you go in higher doses. Now, you quoted for saying -- and you took out the eclipse -- there may be a ceiling -- you quote it by saying that, ""The Melvin study for the position that studies on humans have found that the anesthetic effect of midazolam increased linearly with dosage and estimate that 2milligrams is enough for full surgical anesthetic."" But what Melvin actually said, after pointing out that the ceiling effect is shown by his study, he says, ""But presuming there were no ceiling effect, extrapolation of our data suggests that such a dose would be sufficient."" You took out that -- Well, we're back. Well, we're back to is their a ceiling effect? The judge here said, does it matter? But -- But that's the clear error here. It starts right there. Because the reason Evans thought that it worked -- paralyzed the brain is because he thought this worked on the spinal cord. And nobody argues it works on the spinal cord, number one. And, number two, this is not a central nervous system drug. That's the barbiturates. This is -- works very differently than barbiturates. Depressant, but it's not a -- Exactly. It has no pain-relieving qualities. You're right, it -- it -- but it's still -- I don't know where you're getting -- Justice -- Justice Breyer said, the proof of that. You're unconscious, but that doesn't tell me that you're not feeling pain, or that a noxious stimulant like being burned alive won't cause pain. Look at what happens with the intubations. They paralyze your throat, they give you this drug, but they're paralyzing your throat, and that has its own anesthetic effect and pain relief. So what you're arguing is very different from what's happening here. They're putting a chemical inside of you that's burning you to death. That is the most noxious stimuli I can think of. No, they paralyze them also with the throat local anesthetic. I mean, I read it. Sure, it's a first line in a lot of things -- But it doesn't keep you in an anesthetic state forever. It doesn't keep you during the procedure -- -- during surgeries. In some. If I come out of this argument, because you presented a lot of things to us that wasn't before either the district court or the court of appeals, wouldn't be -- and I believe that your experts didn't prove their point at all and that they showed enough. Why don't we let the district court below sort out whether it still holds to its opinion based on a plethora of materials you've given us? ",could you the way I have think of this and i know that in your brief you think de novo review go to everything if i disagree with you if i think that i have to give deference to the district court s factual finding on how this drug work the how do you call it the midazolam but that it be a legal question of whether how that drug work create a risk of harm that be constitutionally intolerable be that how you divide up the legal end so the fact be now now let us go to my real question okay that a judge ignore evidence be not necessarily an abuse of discretion or a clear error but so what be the clear error in term of the reasoning that the district court use do you even have to go that far the state here do not even propose that their doctor be right on this point they be not defend it they do not say it be true they i concede as i read their brief that it do not work the way the doctor say it work that it do not paralyze the brain correct so it be clear error now we have get an admission that the expert be plainly wrong so how what else i guess there be nothing else that the district court could have base its conclusion on correct well the one proof we do have be the wood execution not the one that be botch but mr wood be give milligram correct and he lay writhe in pain for minute minute i do not remember how long I be sorry hour now there be be some defense that the be not immediately deliver but it be still that go into his system and cause that kind of pain correct counselor i counsel if there be no there be other way to kill people regrettably that be painless it do not have to be a drug protocol that we elect that have a substantial risk of burn a person alive who be paralyze correct i know that you will get up and argue that those other way be be not constitutional either potentially but people do that with every protocol but the little bit of research I have do have show that the reason people do not use the other method it be because it offend them to look at them like you could use gas that render people not even know that they be go to sleep to die and people probably do not want to use that protocol because of what happen during world

the i i have a real problem with whatever you be read because I be go to have to go back to that article i be substantially disturb that in your brief you make factual statement that we be not support by the cited of those source and in fact directly contradict I be go to give you just three small example among many i find so nothing you say or read to me be i go to believe frankly until i see it with my own eye the context okay I will give you a the three example on page and of your brief you cite this drug s fda approve label as hold that that this drug can get you to mild sedation and to deep level of sedation virtually equivalent to the state of general anesthesia where the patient may require external support for vital function but this quote be not on general use this quote come from the section of the fda label where it be say that this drug s effect when take with other drug that suppress the central nervous system this can happen that to me be really there be no other central nervous system drug at play in this protocol on page you cite the no sir go but you do not you quote this for the proposition that it could because a fatality because of the depression of or it could produce general anesthesia sure but he say it be in old people I be you know there have be death from therapeutic dos of this drug it be this be almost like you say because people have die from the use of one aspirin that mean that if i give people aspirin they be go to die it be just not logical obviously people die from anything that you give them that be why there be hospital fatality in every procedure and why there be that but among the million that be give this drug do not die so my point be what the fda be say the general anesthesia effect be only go to happen when you have a central nervous drug central nervous system drug well they put it in that section exactly all right let me give you a second example the melvin study the melvin study say this be how it happen it give this drug in dos of to and what it show be that at dose there be less effect than at and he say this suggest that there be a ceiling effect to this drug and that it be less potent as you go in high dos now you quote for say and you take out the eclipse there may be a ceiling you quote it by say that the melvin study for the position that study on human have find that the anesthetic effect

he say but presume there we be no ceiling effect extrapolation of our data suggest that such a dose would be sufficient you take out that well we be back well we be back to be their a ceiling effect the judge here say do it matter but but that be the clear error here it start right there because the reason evans think that it work paralyze the brain be because he think this work on the spinal

2014,"Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc.",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Does that subjective -- I'm sorry. Does that subjective or -- is it even relevant? Meaning -- the issue is whether they failed to hire her because of her religious practice. Whether the person thinks it is is the issue. I mean, that's why they acted. I'm not sure I understand why you're fighting Justice Kagan's question. Isn't the issue the reason that they acted? They refused to hire someone because they had a 1 percent belief that they had a religious -- pardon the pun -- a religious belief that they wouldn't accommodate? Why -- why does he have to ask about religious beliefs? So why can't the employer just simply say, we have a Look Policy that doesn't permit beards. Can you comply with that policy? That's all they have to -- they don't have to ask about reasons or no reasons. It doesn't really matter why. I'm sorry, I -- I'm sorry. Again, I'm a little confused. I didn't know -- I -- I read your complaint, and it says, ""The Respondent refused to hire Ms. Elauf because she wears a hijab and further failed to accommodate her religious belief by making an exception to the Look Policy."" I looked at your briefs, I looked at the jury charge; and it seems like the two were always tied. The failure to hire was because they refused to accommodate her.

No, I think it was a store manager. Show me where in the script. Because I remember reading this, and she, in fact, said we don't discuss the Look Policy at the interview. Well, isn't that -- isn't that what Ms. Cooke says she did? She said she saw her in a scarf and that she assumed that it was worn because of religious beliefs, so she acted on a stereotype that some, I guess, if you wear a black scarf, it's because of a religious belief. No, he hired her because -- didn't hire her because, under the Look Policy, he believed you could not accommodate that religious belief. Or that religious practice. What's the difference in your -- I mean, I'm a little -- I'm still very confused. You don't think that there could ever be discrimination based on a general neutral policy, because what does it matter if she told him that this was because of religious belief? If he's only firing her or not hiring her because of the Look Policy, then he hasn't discriminated. I am so totally confused. So he hears it from Ms. Cooke and that's not enough? So what's the difference between that and having no -- Frankly, this is such an unusual case because it's very rare that you have an interviewer like Ms. Cooke who's honest.

What you're suggesting -- an interpretative rule to me is an interpretative rule. Is there a statute or a regulation that you're looking at, and you're saying a statute or a regulation, I think it applies this way. You don't talk about a court amending a statute or a regulation when it changes its interpretation.

2014,Direct Marketing Association v. Brohl,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Actually, you have raised the very question I started with, which is the waiver question. Is it your position that the T -- that the TIA is a waivable protection? Is that what you're arguing? MR. ISAACSON: I think -- I think the issue may not be expressly one of waiver, but may be one of consent to agreeing to seek-- --Either way consent or -- it probably is consent. If it is consensual, what you're suggesting is that the reason for the TIA is not jurisdictional in its traditional sense, but one based on comity that can be -- that can be consented to. --But you're saying that collection is only as the money changes hands, that that's the only thing that constitutes collection? I'm -- I'm a little bit confused. In the normal tax situation, meaning my employer, the U.S. Courts, removes taxes from whatever area I declare is -- is my residency. All right. Is my employer required to send that information to the State government? I don't think it is. I think I'm required to send my W-2. So there is no -- okay. Is -- that's what I thought. Now, the -- some employers have to withhold taxes-- --for certain entities in which they're resident or working. And so that's because of jurisdictional powers. The State can control someone who is within their jurisdiction. So that makes sense to me. What doesn't is how can we apply the TIA to an entity that has no direct responsibility to you? When -- and you have no jurisdictional control over them. I mean, there is a presumption in the TIA that collection, assessment, et cetera, is going to be against an entity that owes you something. How are -- how are they enjoined? You can collect everything you want against your taxpayer over you have -- over your having jurisdiction. So how are we restraining you from -- we're not giving you information, but this injunction is not stopping you from collecting that tax. Couldn't we-- --Well, I'm not quite sure that you're addressing the essence of Hibbs. Hibbs defined the terms “ collection ”, “ assessment ”, et cetera very narrowly. Much more narrowly than you are right now. The difference that Justice Breyer was pointing to is the important one. You haven't answered how you can get to where you're going unless we disavow the narrow definitional reading that Hibbs gave to those three issues. Well, you're disavowing then our pointing to in Hibbs the Second Circuit case.

And if you fail it, why shouldn't we apply that test here? Would you -- if we applied it, would you fail it? When you say it seems a little bit of hairsplitting. You say it's a test on residency, but not income. But we have previously said a tax on sleeping, measured by the number of pairs of shoes you have in your closet, is a tax on shoes. So you can call it residency, but if it's still using income as its basis as opposed to property values or whatever else these residency taxes are based on, then why isn't it a tax on income? What if they didn't do it on gross income, but just said every resident has to pay X amount? As an income tax. It's not being based on gross income. Just says every resident has to pay $1,000. That's quite interesting, because New York City's normal population, I think now we have gone down to 7 million, but out-of-state residents that come in are 25 million a day, who work in the city.

2014,"Jesinoski v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc.",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Frederick, the bank, as soon as it receives the notice of rescission -- one of the benefits for people who don't want to pay a mortgage is that it suspends the mortgage payments; correct? All right. So isn't it in the bank's-- --isn't it -- I'm sorry. But for those who don't, the bank can file a declaratory judgment suit? All right. And even for the ones who do, they could do the same thing? Mr. Frederick, does your argument depend on us agreeing with the proposition that the rescission is completed at the time the notice is set? Or the statute of limitations. But you don't get the right to rescission. You don't get a rescission just by filing a lawsuit either. So under your theory, the right of rescission has to be the award. You can't guarantee that a court is going to act in 3 years. There are many State courts where that's just not true any more. It hasn't spoken directly when it sets out a specific procedure for the parties to follow? It spells out -- tells the borrower: Put the notice. It tells the lender to take 20 days to say yea or nay. And if it says yea, it has to return the money and the other side has to give the property. Let's talk about (g), about the rescission occurring or not. It talks about the exercise of a right. But the exercise of the right doesn't mean that the act will have come about. You -- you answered me earlier that a court doesn't have to finish within the three years. You just want to say that it requires the exercise to be a court action, but the statute says something else. It's just notification. Why is that so illogical? I -- I don't understand why it has to be a court action. An exercise of a right is in accordance with the terms of the contract. You just gave -- you just gave your case away when you said the exercise of the right is when you sent the notice. The question is whether that's the exercise of the right within three years. Well, they'd have to do that anyway to foreclose. The only time that it's a problem is when the borrower is not paying the loan, but in most of these, the borrower stops paying the loan. Why are two of these? Why are two of these? I mean, some of the reaction against these lawsuits is premised on the one as opposed to two copies. It seems rather immaterial whether you get one or two. You got it. It -- it's always -- you know, I've signed two loans in I don't know how many years, two homes, but I thought at closing, I signed something acknowledging-- --the bank kept one and presumably, it gave me another.

2014,"Texas Dept. of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project, Inc.",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"At the time of Smith and Griggs, neither the Title VII nor the ADEA used the words ""disparate impact"", and yet we recognize they apply disparate impact. You have a problem, because it says ""to refuse to sell or rent. "" et cetera, ""or otherwise make unavailable"", and the agency charged with interpreting that language has determined that it needs disparate impact. Consequence. It happens to be because that's what you do with housing, but it's a consequence. How do you put ""adversely affect""? Did they have to write it ""or otherwise adversely affect someone by making the housing unavailable? "" I mean, it's a little crazy, don't you think, because otherwise adversely affecting someone by making it unavailable. I think it's otherwise make unavailable-- --is the short form of that. But instead what it did, it took a body of law, some of which had held some practices as disparately -- improperly disparately impacting, like drug addiction and others -- and two others, and said, no, those two won't count, those three won't count. Your reading of those three exemptions is they were unnecessary. Well, what do you make of in 1988 where someone wanted to do away with disparate impact and Congress didn't take up that invitation? Exactly. And ten circuits had already said there was disparate impact. If they didn't like the disparate-impact analysis, they would have taken up the congressman's proposal. But they didn't. It changed when -- no, no, no. When 1988 happened, the Solicitor General changed its position, and it has been consistent since then, that when Congress adopted the three exemptions, it -- it recognized disparate impact as applying to the Fair Housing Act. That intentional brief was not in 1988 and not in -- it was after -- that was before 1988, the 1988 amendments. How-- --Well, you're now talking about application. And let's go back to, you made a statement earlier that this is going to inhibit development of blighted areas. That has to do with the application in this case. If I'm right about the theory of disparate impact, and I can tell you I've studied it very carefully, its intent is to ensure that anyone who is renting or selling property or making it unavailable is doing so not on the basis of artificial, arbitrary or unnecessary hurdles, policies or practices, and it's the Petitioner who has to identify which they are, and to explain why alternatives wouldn't work. If someone's developing a blighted area or an area subject to crime or something else, that's something they can do and that's a criteria, a policy that can't be substituted for something else. So I don't know why you keep saying this is going to affect private development. But this is not race-based decision-making. Are you saying that the 10 percent plan in -- in colleges is race-based if it's an absolutely neutral policy that happens to address a need, which is to integrate schools? So why is it wrong to have a neutral policy? Because none of the policies that were imposed here and in most -- in all other cases are race-based. They're policies that are race neutral, but happen to have a better impact in terms of integration. Well, that-- --It's not -- liability is not -- well, ""triggered"" is a good word; but it's not imposed because of that. It's imposed because the lower court found, rightly or wrongly -- I don't want to get into the merits of that -- that some of the criteria being used was -- were unnecessary and that was -- and there was no legitimate business reason for it. I could, as Justice Breyer said, quarrel with that conclusion; but that's in application. That's not in the standard that disparate impact imposes. We're not talking about this case. All right. Why don't you get to the legal issue, if you could. Could you-- --Could you-- --Could we go back? Could we go back? I think you've been interrupted. The steps are: First you show that there's -- that the numbers are off. Then the other side tells you what the reason is for why the numbers are off. You, then, have an opportunity or an obligation to come and suggest alternative methods of taking care of the legitimate business need. Correct? So you -- those are the three steps? If you can propose ways that are race neutral, practices that' are race neutral that will have -- take care of their needs, meaning the other side's needs, then you get relief. Do you think that a private developer would ever be found guilty of disparate impact because he owns a piece of property in an affluent neighborhood? He's permitted to develop his property, right? The disparate impact would be if he fails to sell or make available to people of all races, let's say, the units in that property, correct? Practice. All right. The specific practice-- --that has a business-- --Exactly. To underscore that, because I think everybody is getting confused with this, disparate impact does not go to who they take unless they set up a practice-- --that has that affect. Well, you keep saying that, but that's not what happened here. The remedy was not to tell you to move your development from one area to another. The remedy here is -- it did preclude development next to landfills, but it also included other -- other tinkering with the qualifications. But you're going to still need people who want to do-- --what they want to do. That has to go with your attacks on the remedy. That has -- doesn't have anything to do with what disparate impact as an approach set out by HUD -- direct should be done. No. What they do is what everyone should do. Is before they set up any policies, think about what is the most race-neutral policy. That's a very different thing. That, I think, everyone is obligated to do. It's only if the other side proves that a qualification has an -- a race effect that's not necessary, can they win. What in the remedy ordered here was race-based? What remedy said you have to take in 10, 20, 15 percent? ",at the time of smith and griggs neither the title vii nor the adea use the word disparate impact and yet we recognize they apply disparate impact you have a problem because it say to refuse to sell or rent et cetera or otherwise make unavailable and the agency charge with interpret that language have determine that it need disparate impact consequence it happen to be because that be what you do

2014,Obergefell v. Hodges,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Could you -- Well, may I ask a -- Now, counselor, in -- in terms of this millennium, what's been the status or the view of gay people in most of those countries? Have they been subject to the kinds of discrimination that they were subject to here? Were they welcomed into the worldwide community? Was it free of discrimination? Counselor, there have been antidiscrimination laws in various States; correct? Antidiscrimination laws regarding gay people. And in any of those States, have ministers been forced to do gay marriages? I'm sorry. Nobody is taking that away from anybody. Every single individual in this society chooses, if they can, their sexual orientation or who to marry or not marry. I suspect even with us giving gays rights to marry that there's some gay people who will choose not to. Just as there's some heterosexual couples who choose not to marry. So we're not taking anybody's liberty away. You don't do that. That's the problem. Marriage doesn't do that on any level. How many married couples do fathers with the benefits or the requirements of marriage walk away from their children? So it's not that the institution alone does it and that without it that father is going to stay in the marriage. He made a choice. I would say that it could -- I could -- it should be gender-neutral. Some mothers do the same thing. But my point is that I'm not sure how I get to the point that Justice Breyer is making: How does withholding marriage from one group, same -- same-sex couples, increase the value to the other group? But the problem is that even under a rational-basis standard, do we accept a feeling? I mean, why is -- why as -- and I think Justice Kagan put the argument quite clearly, with something as fundamental as marriage, why would that feeling, which doesn't make any logical sense, control our decision-making? My problem is that I think people who get into marriage think that, heterosexual couples. Everybody has their own vision of what marriage is, but what the State confers is certain obligations -- -- and they are willing to accept those. Whether or not that couple stays together, they are bound to that child. They have to support the child, they have to care for him or her. Some people choose voluntarily, meaning they just choose because they don't want to, but that happens in -- whether it's same-sex or heterosexual couples. No, I -- I think they should be bound to their parent, because there's a lot of adopted children and they are not thinking of biological moms and dads. You know, well -- I -- I -- you know, the problem is that I don't actually accept your starting premise. The right to marriage is, I think, embedded in our constitutional law. It is a fundamental right. We've said it in a number of cases. The issue is you can't narrow it down to say, but is gay marriage fundamental? Has black-and-white marriage been treated fundamentally? The issue was starting from the proposition of, is the right to marry fundamental? And then is it compelling for a State to exclude a group of people? And that, for me, is as -- as simple as the question gets. But that wasn't changed because of the recent gay marriages. In Massachusetts, we've got data that it's -- the rates have remained constant since they changed their laws. Well, what -- what did that have to do with prisoners? If the States' interest is in fostering procreation between natural parents, the -- it seems to me that the prison who -- at issue did that. It said you can get married if there's a child on the way. And that would foster the -- or -- or promote the interest. We, instead, said, that's not enough. The fundamental right to marry does bestow an important -- an important connection that we can't deprive the prisoner of, even if the prisoner at least at the moment and presumably those serving life sentences, have no chance of procreation. Now, could I -- could I -- because I don't -- if you want to finish answering Justice Scalia's -- Sir, how about the co-sanguinity situation? Virtually all states would recognize cousins through marriage getting married, but there's at least one State that doesn't; right? Are you saying that that State is -- This is not incest. They're not biologically tied. I thought your -- -- your argument -- -- would be different. I thought that the States had never categorically passed a law declaring that a particular kind of marriage was against public policy. No one of the four States had ever done that? Until the DOMA issue came up. Well, they -- So you don't see -- I'm sorry. You don't see a fundamental difference between creating a marriage and recognizing a marriage? You don't think there's any difference in terms of the rights of people? If States regularly don't say that the prerequisites to marriage in our State are not necessarily against public policy -- and they have said it for age differences, they have said it for a lot of things, why -- why would the gay marriage issue be so fundamental that that can lead them to exclude a whole category of people from recognition? You think marriage -- -- decrees are closer to laws? You think marriage decrees are closer to laws than they are to judgments? I mean, you need to get a judgment to divorce. And I think that, in my mind, that makes the decree much closer to a judgment than it does to a law. So what is an order under the Constitution, or -- -- an act under the Constitution that's not a judgment? How do you separate out the terms that Justice Scalia gave you? They're not all judgments. Three different terms were used, or four different terms were used. Acts -- -- records -- That happens already. People who are not permitted to be married in a lot of States go and do that, and they come back to their home States, and the home States follow the rule of marriage celebration. Well, they have -- The prerequisites are always a State's judgment about marriage, about what should be a recognized marriage. They make exceptions. Oh, but you do that for adoptions. What's -- what's the problem? This -- this is a really big deal? Do you think that a State can fail to recognize the birth certificate of a particular -- another State? Just that. Do you think the word ""records"" in the Constitution includes birth certificates? So California without any reason, no suspicion of fraud, no anything, could it refuse to recognize another State's birth certificate? Records to me has to have a meaning. I recognize that that's an issue. But if a birth certificate were to be a record, don't you think a marriage certificate -- it's an official act of a State. As a record. ",could you well may i ask a now counselor in in term of this millennium what be be the status or the view of gay people in most of those country have they be subject to the kind of discrimination that they we be subject to here we be they welcome into the worldwide community be it free of discrimination counselor there have be antidiscrimination law in various state correct antidiscrimination law regard gay people and in any of those state have minister be force to do gay marriage I be sorry nobody be take that away from anybody every single individual in this society choose if they can their sexual orientation or who to marry or not marry i suspect even with us give gay right to marry that there be some gay people who will choose not to just as there be some heterosexual couple who choose not to marry so we be not take anybody s liberty away you do not do that that be the problem marriage do not do that on any level how many marry couple do father with the benefit or the requirement of marriage walk away from their child so it be not that the institution alone do it and that without it that father be go to stay in the marriage he make a choice i would say that it could i could it should be gender neutral some mother do the same thing but my point be that I be not sure how i get to the point that justice breyer be make how do withhold marriage from one group same same sex couple increase the value to the other group but the problem be that even under a rational basis standard do we accept a feeling i mean why be why as and i think justice kagan put the argument quite clearly with something as fundamental as marriage why would that feeling which do not make any logical sense control our decision making my problem be that i think people who get into marriage think that heterosexual couple everybody have their own vision of what marriage be but what the state confers be certain obligation and they be willing to accept those whether or not that couple stay together they be bind to that child they have to support the child they have to care for him or her some people choose voluntarily mean they just choose because they do not want to but that happen in whether it be same sex or heterosexual couple no i i think they should be bind to their parent because there be a lot of adopt child and they be not think of biological mom and dad you know well i i you know the problem be that i do not actually accept your start premise the right to marriage be i think embed in our constitutional law it be a fundamental right we have say it in a number of case the issue be you can not narrow it down to say but be gay marriage fundamental have black and white marriage be treat fundamentally the issue be start from the proposition of be the right to marry fundamental and then be it compel for a state to exclude a group of people and that for me be as as simple as the question get but that be not change because of the recent gay marriage in massachusetts we have get data that it be the rate have remain constant since they change their law well what what do that have to do with prisoner if the state interest be in foster procreation between natural parent the it seem to me that the prison who at issue do that it say you can get married if there be a child on the way and that would foster the or or promote the interest we instead say that be not enough the fundamental right to marry do bestow an important an important connection that we can not deprive the prisoner of even if the prisoner at least at the moment and presumably those serve life sentence have no chance of procreation now could i could i because i do not if you want to finish answer justice scalia s sir how about the co sanguinity situation virtually all state would recognize cousin through marriage get marry but there be at least one state that do not right be you say that that state be this be not incest they be not biologically tie i think your your argument would be different i think that the state have never categorically pass a law declare that a particular kind of marriage be against public policy no one of the four state have ever do that until the doma issue come up well they so you do not see I be sorry you do not see a fundamental difference between create a marriage and recognize a marriage you do not think there be any difference in term of the right of people if state regularly do not say that the prerequisite to marriage in our state be not necessarily against public policy and they have say it for age difference they have say it for a lot of thing why why would the gay marriage issue be so fundamental that that can lead them to exclude a whole category of people from recognition you think marriage decree be close to law you think marriage decree be close to law than they be to judgment i mean you need to get a judgment to divorce and i think that in my mind that make the decree much closer to a judgment than it do to a law so what be an order under the constitution or an act under the constitution that be not a judgment how do you separate out the term that justice scalia give you they be not all judgment three different term we be use or four different term we be use act record that happen already people who be not permit to be marry in a lot of state go and do that and they come back to their home state and the home state follow the rule of marriage celebration well they have the prerequisite be always a state s judgment about marriage about what should be a recognize marriage they make exception oh but you do that for adoption what be what be the problem this this be a really big deal do you think that a state can fail to recognize the birth certificate of a particular another state just that do you think the word record in the constitution include birth certificate so california without any reason no suspicion of fraud no anything could it refuse to recognize another state s birth certificate record to me have to have a meaning i recognize that that be an issue but if a birth certificate we be to be a record do not you think a marriage certificate it be an official act of a state as a record ,513.4799999999998,Roberts Court,"Apr 28, 2015","James Obergefell, et al.","Richard Hodges, Director of the Ohio Department of Health, et al.",14-556,"Jan 16, 2015","Jun 26,

2014,Rodriguez v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"All right. But first of all-- --these are hypotheticals that have a wrong presumption, okay? There are certain tasks involved in giving a traffic ticket, correct? And those include checking for warrants, checking for tickets on the car, checking identity, asking questions about that, and generally with identity it also has to do with where are you going and where are you coming from. Correct? I'm sorry? I didn't hear that. My question for you -- and it can't be the formal act of writing the ticket. It has to be the formal -- it has to be the acts related to the mission. When you finish those, that's when the stop ends. Yes, but you've tied it to just writing it handing over the ticket, but or you're not even doing that, you're -- you're saying just writing the ticket, which is crazy. It's a policy question. So answer -- answer it as a policy question. Don't tie it to the stop or not. Tie it to something else. You know, it really looks-- --Can I just ask you a simple question? Yes, we've permitted a dog search; but in the cases that we have, Caballes and others, it was done simultaneous with the traffic stop. Correct? You said in your brief: A dog sniff is not a police entitlement to which the Fourth Amendment limits must bend. Is there a line that we should draw at how long citizens should be kept by the side of the road? All right. So announce what that line is. That's what I think everybody's been asking you. Why don't you just do a simple test? If you're going to do a -- if you're going to do a stop, you can't reasonably extend or pass the time it takes to deal with a ticket, correct? That would be the simple rule. How long is reasonable? You keep saying in your in your papers you have to look at the totality of the circumstances, but I don't know what that means. I think that keeping me most of the time, and Chief, I've been stopped -- keeping me past-- --Keeping me past giving me the ticket is annoying as heck whether it's 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 45. But how do you define de minimis? What are the circumstances that would make any difference be -- in holding somebody 5 minutes or 45? It all has to do with your needs, not the passenger's needs. To accomplish what? Break into -- go into their home and search their home? Is that okay? Well, I have a -- I have a real fundamental question, because this line drawing is only here because we've now created a Fourth Amendment entitlement to search for drugs by using dogs, whenever anybody's stopped. Because that's what you're proposing. And is that really what the Fourth Amendment should permit? Well, in some circumstances. So why don't -- why don't we keep it cabin to Caballes, which is when it's being done simultaneous with writing the ticket. If it's not, then it's unlawful. It's not arbitrary. The Fourth Amendment is arbitrary by its nature. It says you can't search unless you have probable cause to search. But the way Justice Breyer has said this -- what he's saying is you can't unreasonably prolong. You can't hold a person any -- any measurable time that would allow to get the dog. And, yes, it has to do with the resources of the police department, but we can't keep bending the Fourth Amendment to the resources of law enforcement. Particularly when this stop is not -- is not incidental to the purpose of the stop. It's purely to help the police get more criminals, yes. But then the Fourth Amendment becomes a useless piece of paper. Well, he said-- ",all right but first of all these be hypothetical that have a wrong presumption okay there be certain task involve in give a traffic ticket correct and those include check for warrant check for ticket on the car check identity ask question about that and generally with identity it also have to do with where be you go and where be you come from correct I be sorry i do not hear that my question for you and it can not be the formal act of write the ticket it have to be the formal it have to be the act relate to the mission when you finish those that be when the stop end yes but you have tie it to just write it hand over the ticket but or you be not even do that you be you be say just write the ticket which be crazy it be a policy question so answer answer it as a policy question do not tie it to the stop or not tie it to something else you know it really look can i just ask you a simple question yes we have permit a dog search but in the case that we have caballes and others it be do simultaneous with the traffic stop correct you say in your brief a dog sniff be not a police entitlement to which the fourth amendment limit must bend be there a line that we should draw at how long citizen should be keep by the side of the road all right so announce what that line be that be what i think everybody s be ask you why do not you just do a simple test if you be go to do a if you be go to do a stop you can not reasonably extend or pass the time it take to deal with a ticket correct that would be the simple rule how long be reasonable you keep say in your in your paper you have to look at the totality of the circumstance but i do not know what that mean i think that keep me most of the time and chief I have be stop keep me past keep me past give me the ticket be annoy as heck whether it be minute minute but how do you define de minimis what be the circumstance that would make any difference be in hold somebody minute or it all have to do with your need not the passenger s need to accomplish what break into go into their home and search their home be that okay well i have a i have a real fundamental question because this line drawing be only here because we have now create a fourth amendment entitlement to search for drug by use dog whenever anybody s stopped because that be what you be propose and be that really what the fourth amendment should permit well in some circumstance so why do not why do not we keep it cabin to caballes which be when it be be do simultaneous with write the ticket if it be not then it be unlawful it be not arbitrary the fourth amendment be arbitrary by its nature it say you can not search unless you have probable because to search but the way justice breyer have say this what he be say be you can not unreasonably prolong you can not hold a person any any measurable time that would allow to get the dog and yes it have to do with the resource of the police department but we can not keep bend the fourth amendment to the resource of law enforcement particularly when this stop be not be not incidental to the purpose of the stop it be purely to help the police get more criminal yes but then the fourth amendment become a useless piece of paper well he say ,257.74999999999994,Roberts Court,"Jan 21, 2015",Dennys Rodriguez,United States,13-9972,"Dec 2, 2014","Apr 21, 2015",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2014,"M&G Polymers USA, LLC v. Tackett",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"That's what you say, but there was a hearing by the district court. You're recommending we apply ordinary contract principles. Assume assume that I find those words ambiguous, you have a hearing. The district court had a hearing, and it didn't -- I don't think the district court relied on a presumption. It relied on a bevy of evidence, including the fact that your company bought the predecessor company, assessing the health contributions at full value for retirees. Why -- why wouldn't ordinary contract principles permit the district court to do exactly what it did here? Well, we know that contracts have certain assumptions about them, about what continues. Arbitration provisions continue after the expiration. We have found that, correct? And Justice Scalia just said to you something that talks about retirement and the surviving spouse and her right to get things would -- I think could reasonably be viewed as a vesting provision. See, that's-- --the question for the following reason. I don't know whether there's a lifetime health benefit if this company stops providing any, meaning if the company some day says we're not going to give any whatsoever, the issue -- that, I think, is a more interesting question because then the contract has truly expired. But if it chooses to, it seems to me that the full benefits or -- will receive a reduced -- will receive a full company contribution, could suggest that that doesn't expire. So long as the health -- as long as the company is providing health insurance. Now, the only point of this that I'm unsure of is that almost all of the other circuits require either a clear statement of vesting or at least words clearly susceptible to vesting. One or the other. How do you stand on those two principles of statutory-- --I'm saying what other -- I think other courts have done this, correct? They have presumptions against vesting, some of the courts. This may be an unfair question, but following up on what Justice Scalia is getting at, I don't know how many others of those rubber companies are requiring contributions of active employees that are different than the contributions of retired employees. Do you have any information about that? I'll give you a question about retirees. I don't know if it's industry standard or just this contract. Are retirees eligible to vote on the agreements that are entered into by the union? They are not. And is that generally true of retirees? And do they -- does the union represent them in any other disputes they may have as retirees with -- because generally, the union represents employees, active employees? I'm not sure that's true. I-- --The language of vesting has to be reasonably susceptible from something in the contract. But the contract as a whole. How about the spouses?

2014,King v. Burwell,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"But the State, if made the -- Take a breath. (Laughter.) I'm -- I'm a little concerned with how you envision this provision working. You're saying that the HHS Exchange can't be for the State so that it's established by the choice of the State. The choice the State had was establish your own Exchange or let the Federal government establish it for you. That was the choice. If we read it the way you're saying, then we're going to read a statute as intruding on the Federal-State relationship, because then the States are going to be coerced into establishing their own Exchanges. And you say, oh, no, they can't be coerced, but let's go back to what Justice Breyer was talking about. In those States that don't -- their citizens don't receive subsidies, we're going to have the death spiral that this system was created to avoid. States are obligated, insurers are obligated to make sure that in their States, whether they're part of this program or not, that they have guaranteed coverage, that 26 -- that children are covered till they're 26, and that they base their costs on community ratings. So if they have to do that, then costs are going to rise on every insurance -- every insurance plan offered in the country in those 34 States, 3 or 6 of -- or 9 of your States will have tightened their Medicaid eligibility requirements in contravention of the Act, so they're taking money by breaking their compacts. They would have to lose all of their Medicaid money. Tell me how that is not coercive in an unconstitutional way? And if it is coercive in an unconstitutional way, in Bond just -- I think it was last term, we said that that is a primary statutory command; that we read a statute in a way where we don't impinge on the basic Federal-State relationship. Oh, we did it -- we said it last year. There are many -- So why create 1326 at all? Obviously, they thought that some States wouldn't. Very possible. Because they set up a mechanism for that to happen. But nobody -- no one's going to visit the program if there are no subsidies because not enough people will buy the programs to stay in the Exchanges. Wait a minute. That was the whole purpose that drove this bill because States had experimented with this, and those that didn't have subsidies or other -- other provisions of the Act didn't survive. You said it yourself in the prior case. My problem -- my problem is that -- the reverse. You're talking about Congress, how -- hiding, borrowing the phrase of one of my colleagues, a -- a -- a huge thing in a mousetrap. Okay? Because do you really believe that States fully understood that they were not going to get -- their citizens were not going to get subsidies if they let the Federal government? What senator said that during the hearings? Would you -- would you -- Why wouldn't we accept a representation by him? If he -- if he makes a representation that at least 1 of the 4 is -- has -- was liable in 2014 and is liable in 2000 -- or will be liable in 2015 -- I mean, we know at least one of them won't because that's -- This is part of Section 1312. A person qualified to purchase on an Exchange must, quote, reside in the State that established the Exchange. General -- Could I follow up on something the General ended with, which -- and Justice Kennedy referred to, which is the need to read subsidies limited. But so is -- in a limited way. But so is the need to ensure that exemptions from tax liability are read in a limited way. And under your reading, we're giving more exemptions to employers not to provide insurance, more exemptions to States and others or to individuals, how -- how does that work? I mean, you've got two competing -- Well -- ",but the state if make the take a breath laughter I be I be a little concerned with how you envision this provision work you be say that the hhs exchange can not be for the state so that it be establish by the choice of the state the choice the state have be establish your own exchange or let the federal government establish it for you that be the choice if we read it the way you be say then we be go to read a statute as intrude on the federal state relationship because then the state be go to be coerce into establish their own exchange and you say oh no they can not be coerce but let us go back to what justice breyer be talk about in those state that do not their citizen do not receive subsidy we be go to have the death spiral that this system be create to avoid state be obligate insurer be obligate to make sure that in their state whether they be part of this program or not that they have guarantee coverage that that child be cover till they be and that they base their cost on community rating so if they have to do that then cost be go to rise on every insurance every insurance plan offer in the country in those state or of or of your state will have tighten their medicaid eligibility requirement in contravention of the act so they be take money by break their compact they would have to lose all of their medicaid money tell me how that be not coercive in an unconstitutional way and if it be coercive in an unconstitutional way in bond just i think it be last term we say that that be a primary statutory command that we read a statute in a way where we do not impinge on the basic federal state relationship oh we do it we say it last year there be many so why create at all obviously they think that some state would not very possible because they set up a mechanism for that to happen but nobody no one s go to visit the program if there be no subsidy because not enough people will buy the program to stay in the exchange wait a minute that be the whole purpose that drive this bill because state have experiment with this and those that do not have subsidy or other other provision of the act do not survive you say it yourself in the prior case my problem my problem be that the reverse you be talk about congress how hiding borrow the phrase of one of my colleague a a a huge thing in a mousetrap okay because do you really believe that state fully understand that they we be not go to get their citizen we be not go to get subsidy if they let the federal government what senator say that during the hearing would you would you why would not we accept a representation by him if he if he make a representation that at least of the be have be liable in and be liable in or will be liable in i mean we know at least one of them will not because that be this be part of section a person qualify to purchase on an exchange must quote reside in the state that establish the exchange general could i follow up on something the general end with which and justice kennedy refer to which be the need to read subsidy limit but so be in a limited way but so be the need to ensure that exemption from tax liability be read in a limited way and under your reading we be give more exemption to employer not to provide insurance more exemption to state and others or to individual how how do that work i mean you have get two compete well ,310.1500000000001,Roberts Court,"Mar 4, 2015","David King, et al.","Sylvia Mathews Burwell, Secretary of Health and Human Services, et al.",14-114,"Nov 7, 2014","Jun 25, 2015",113.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1

2014,Mellouli v. Lynch,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Can I-- --If you -- if you -- I think Justice Alito is right. If you're claiming that, then you're accepting that there's ambiguity, and you have an uphill battle to fight. That's an argument that they're arbitrary and capricious. It has to involve a controlled -- a Federally controlled substance. That -- that's the linchpin. Counsel, if we -- just to move you along, if we -- do you agree with the government that if we find the government's distinction between drug trade offenses like the paraphernalia statute and drug possession and distribution offenses unreasonable, do we remand to the board? And if not, why not? And if you want to save it in an answer on rebuttal, you can. I'm sorry, I don't understand that. You're doing the flip of Justice Ginsburg. You're -- so how many drugs on that list have to relate to 802 drugs for it to relate generally? Well, that's how you get to drug paraphernalia, meaning, as Justice Kagan said, the drug paraphernalia comes in only because it relates to drug possession and distribution-- --of a controlled substance under 801. Or 802, what is it -- whatever it is. You keep leaving out the 802. There are other sections of the criminal act that specifically say, any conviction and -- and it could be of any law, right? But this one doesn't say it that way. And -- difficult -- now answer. How many of the laws -- how many of the controlled substances have to be on the State list? Is 50/50 enough, 75/25, 6 out of-- --I mean, what -- what's the -- how many have to be on the list? But that's not true of foreign laws and this relates to foreign laws. I mean, there are some foreign countries that list many of the controlled substances the U.S. does but adds alcohol. Now, some people may think alcohol is a controlled substance, but it's not on the 802 list. Well, right now even your brief admits that the BIA is applying a different standard to possession and distribution offenses. It's applying the 802 specification. And it's trying to draw a difference. I don't -- I still don't understand how it does it, but my point is that you're proving it's -- you're living by the 802 distinction with distribution and possession. Yeah, what you're hoping for is that they will change that one, too. But let's answer what's happened up until now. Because they have discretion. If they're not automatically removable and they look at the underlying papers and decide it's a more serious crime than -- than the -- than the strict removability statute, they let the person they remove this person anyway. It's -- it's exactly like it. When Congress intended to say -- and I can point to at least three provisions -- when it wanted to say any controlled substance without reference to -- to 802, it said, any controlled substance. And when it wanted to limit it to 802, it defined the controlled substance as being listed in 802. So it knows how to differentiate the two. Espinoza came out when? That was a Federal crime, though. It had to relate to a controlled substance on the Federal list, to all drugs on the Federal list. I don't think that's the important point that Justice Ginsburg's making. She's saying under Federal law, this person can't be convicted for that drug that's not a drug on the Federal list -- but it can -- or the State list -- but can be convicted, under your theory, for possessing the sock and that non-illicit drug in the sock. With the -- with that particular unscheduled item. Why is it a poor way? I mean, the drugs that the Federal government believes are the most serious are listed in 802. And so if you have to prove, under the modified categorical approach, that one of those drugs was the intended use, what is so horrible and -- and dissonant about affecting the intent based on the drugs Congress has chosen to list? No, no, no, no, no. We I know that you keep saying “ for many years ”, but it's not that many years. And the BIA has routinely required in distribution and possession cases that you identify the drug. And so they haven't found it impossible in thousands of those cases.

The government takes the position that if we rule in your favor, that means that we're doing away with, effectively, the FSS. Is that your view? Can it tell from that database whether or not a particular vendor is a veteran or a disabled veteran? Well, there's two databases. There is general database and there is the FSS database. Are we talking about the same one? Which -- and then you are wanting to do away with the FSS? So they go through the FSS and find the veteran-owned businesses? Hasn't the SBA been using it? But you're not talking about just the small value contracts. You want the supply to all contracts, to all orders.

Take that database, look at it, look at what it is you need, a stapler, and see if -- how many vendors on that list supply staplers, and then check that against the FSS? If there's no veteran that matches the FSS list, then you go to the FSS. What's the problem with that -- No. You didn't listen to me. You go to your veteran-owned list; you're looking for staplers.

2015,Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"It would have had more than that. It would have had circuit precedent. It could have been woefully infringing, correct? If I were going to bet, I would say yes to that question. Wouldn't you? Right. Mr. Rosenkranz, I -- I think that Justice Breyer is getting to something. Put on a hat that doesn't want to win outright. Okay? Put on a hat where we're trying to announce a rule. And I'm sympathetic to your argument that the Second Circuit rule obviously stacks everything in favor of a winning plaintiff -- publish -- a winning copyright holder because 80 percent are now winning, if not more. In the Second Circuit, it's almost 89 percent. It means, when you're talking about the reasonableness of a -- a winning party's position, in most cases the copyright holder has a reasonable position. So -- and the defendant, by losing, tends to have an unreasonable position. I looked at what happened after Fogerty, and the -- after Fogerty and Fantasy, that's where the Ninth Circuit tests began. And the Court there said there's different incentives for plaintiffs and defendants. You can't make the reasonableness of the position the centerpiece for prevailing defendants, or otherwise, they're never going to get fees, or hardly ever. So going back to Justice Breyer's question, how do we articulate what the Second Circuit is doing wrong without necessarily endorsing all of the factors of the Ninth Circuit? So the test would be, it's okay to have it one among others, but not a presumption that says that's always going to entitle you to defend against an award or to win an award. Except there is -- Mr. Smith, I'm troubled by what's happening in the Second Circuit. I've actually, with the help of the library, looked at cases in the Second and the Ninth Circuit for the last three years, and this is what I'm coming out with: In the Ninth Circuit, prevailing defendants have received fees 20 times and lost 17 times, about 50 percent. In the Second circuit, prevailing defendants have received fees three times and lost 16 times. That's a huge difference. If I look at what's happening with prevailing plaintiffs, in the Second Circuit, prevailing plaintiffs awarded fees 23 times, and prevailing plaintiffs denied fees seven. In the Ninth, prevailing plaintiffs got it 46 times and denied fees twice. Prevailing plaintiffs are winning everywhere in extraordinary numbers. And in both circuits, prevailing defendants are not winning hardly at all. At best, 50 percent in the Ninth Circuit. So does it say something that somehow, prevailing -- that this presumption that the Second Circuit is giving is unfair to defendants and to the purposes of the copyright law? But that was a study from 2000, correct? Having practiced in this area, I know you're right. But -- but isn't there a problem in having one factor outweigh all others? It's much harder to start a -- with a presumption up here and all the other factors have to tie against that one to overcome it. Why don't we just have the Fogerty factors, which are it's one among many? But since most plaintiffs are not going to sue unless their position is arguably, reasonably present, shouldn't we be looking at how reasonable the defendant's position was? When the defendant wins. The problem with your situation is that you're looking at incentives. If I'm Wiley, I'm looking at this and saying, there's a 90 percent chance -- 80 to 90 percent chance I'm going to get fees, because willful infringers -- and that's the judgment that was being defended below -- almost always, the winning plaintiff gets fees. If I'm a defendant, I'm Kirtsaeng, I know that the probability is -- taking Mr. Rosenkranz's numbers, are that maybe 50 percent of the prevailing defendants gets fees. If without pro bono counsel, do you think he would have continued? And would have gone into debt for it? I -- I don't know the answer, but the -- the incentives are very, very different for a defendant who's being asked to go on with the litigation because the likelihood of them getting fees is so much smaller. He got a willfulness found below. How do you get a willfulness found in a situation where you know there's a circuit -- -- where there is a chance of a split court, 4-to-4? Are you asking us, in our decision, to endorse the Second Circuit test and reject the Ninth Circuit test, articulate it the way that the Ninth Circuit does, what -- the Second Circuit test does? Ask us exactly what you want us to announce with respect to what the test should be or not be. I'm sorry. Which case?

2015,Hurst v. Florida,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Do you think this scheme, assuming we agree with Justice Scalia, that you don't really need unanimity, would this still be good law under Apodaca -- Apodaca -- -- the case that said that we -- we needed a unanimous jury, but, you know, nine out of twelve is okay? Do you -- do you think seven out of five is okay? It's not. We're not required to do anything. We could just say it's not the functional equivalent. But is -- -- but is it still good law. Shouldn't we overrule it? Mr. Waxman, am -- am I understanding the case properly? The informant, who had all of the physical evidence, was the main identifier of the defendant, correct? And -- Now, did -- So the defendant claimed, however, that this informant was the one who did the crime. Could the jury, under the evidence that existed, conclude that they both did it? And that's why it's debatable whether it's harmless? Because what makes it an aggravator is if he's the one who actually did the killing. That he wasn't -- Uh-huh. Personally? All right. That's -- I'm sorry. How -- how is that, when Florida law says that the judge has to find an aggravator to make someone eligibility for the death penalty? Could you tell me how this is different than Arizona? I mean, in terms of the system, just like in the Arizona case, there had been precedent by this Court that Arizona law had been constitutional. Unlike Arizona, every Florida -- every court that has looked -- every judge who's looked at it, not one of them has said that they believe personally it's constitutional. Even the courts affirming -- affirm on the basis of the prior precedent, and you have a little less than half the Court directly saying it violates Ring. So what's the jury finding when it says seven to five? Even when it says a murder has been committed, felony murder wasn't. Felony murder was charged, but we don't know if they found the robbery, right? So how do we know -- How do we know which one they picked? Which makes them eligible for the death penalty? But you do agree that that -- it doesn't require unanimous jury? And a simple majority is all you need? So we don't have -- -- an unanimous jury, even a functionally equivalent unanimous jury, finding those aggravators. We don't have a unanimous or functionally unanimous jury finding those aggravators. I'm sorry. The jury is not asked to find an aggravator. It's not asked to find an aggravator. I know. But that's not found at the jury verdict. It's not found at the trial -- You're -- only at the sentencing phase. I'm sorry. I just want -- I'm -- I'm sorry. Justice Scalia. I want to clarify. You think a seven to five recommendation is finding an element of the crime that makes you eligible for the death penalty by a unanimous or functionally equivalent unanimous jury? Then what do you do with the statement in our case law that says a simple majority is not a unanimous jury? And they don't agree with which one? So we don't know whether it was premeditation or robbery. It could be four to three or two to five. It could be anything. We don't know. What does the seven to five tell us the jury found? Not the same one? But you believe that a simple majority is a jury unanimously or functionally unanimously finding that element beyond a reasonable doubt? What about -- How about if a jury -- Can I ask you two separate questions on this? Number one, whenever have we said that a jury waiver on an issue is based on the lack of a challenge by a defense attorney? Don't we require waivers of jury trials to be explicit and by the defendant him or herself? So where have we ever said that not challenging something is an admission of that something? We take plenty of appeals where people are saying, assuming the state of facts, I'm entitled to X, and then when they go back down, they argue that that goes -- that assumption is wrong. Why isn't this the same? Has there ever been an appeal in Florida where an advisory jury was given -- not given a proper instruction and a resentence was -- was ordered for that reason? An improper instruction to the advisory jury. ",do you think this scheme assume we agree with justice scalia that you do not really need unanimity would this still be good law under apodaca apodaca the case that say that we we need a unanimous jury but you know nine out of twelve be okay do you do you think seven out of five be okay it be not we be not require to do anything we could just say it be not the functional equivalent but be but be it still good law should not we overrule it mr waxman be be i understand the case properly the informant who have all of the physical evidence be the main identifier of the defendant correct and now do so the defendant claim however that this informant be the one who do the crime could the jury under the evidence that exist conclude that they both do it and that be why it be debatable whether it be harmless because what make it an aggravator be if he be the one who actually do the killing that he be not uh huh personally all right that be I be sorry how how be that when florida law say that the judge have to find an aggravator to make someone eligibility for the death penalty could you tell me how this be different than arizona i mean in term of the system just like in the arizona case there have be precedent by this court that arizona law have be constitutional unlike arizona every florida every court that have look every judge who be look at it not one of them have say that they believe personally it be constitutional even the court affirm affirm on the basis of the prior precedent and you have a little less than half the court directly say it violate ring so what be the jury find when it say seven to five even when it say a murder have be commit felony murder be not felony murder be charge but we do not know if they find the robbery right so how do we know how do we know which one they pick which make them eligible for the death penalty but you do agree that that it do not require unanimous jury and a simple majority be all you need so we do not have an unanimous jury even a functionally equivalent unanimous jury find those aggravator we do not have a unanimous or functionally unanimous jury find those aggravator I be sorry the jury be not ask to find an aggravator it be not ask to find an aggravator i know but that be not find at the jury verdict it be not find at the trial you be only at the sentence phase I be sorry i just want I be I be sorry justice scalia i want to clarify you think a seven to five recommendation be find an element of the crime that make you eligible for the death penalty by a unanimous or functionally equivalent unanimous jury then what do you do with the statement in our case law that say a simple majority be not a unanimous jury and they do not agree with which one so we do not know whether it be premeditation or robbery it could be four to three or two to five it could be anything we do not know what do the seven to five tell us the jury find not the same one but you believe that a simple majority be a jury unanimously or functionally unanimously find that element beyond a reasonable doubt what about how about if a jury can i ask you two separate question on this number one whenever have we say that a jury waiver on an issue be base on the lack of a challenge by a defense attorney do not we require waiver of jury trial to be explicit and by the defendant him or herself so where have we ever say that not challenge something be an admission of that something we take plenty of appeal where people be say assume the state of fact I be entitle to x and then when they go back down they argue that that go that assumption be wrong why be not this the same have there ever be an appeal in florida where an advisory jury be give not give a proper instruction and a resentence be be order for that reason an improper instruction to the advisory jury ,295.3900000000001,Roberts Court,"Oct 13, 2015",Timothy Lee Hurst,Florida,14-7505,"Mar 9, 2015","Jan 12, 2016",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

Frankly, I'm a little less moved by that because, from my personal experience, those stale claims generally don't make it past a motion to dismiss. Very few of them are appealed because if they're really that stale, those constructive discharge claims are usually thrown out. The case is litigated on other grounds. I'm sorry. That's true, and that's why I thought -- -- that was an open question. But the government, Mr. Gannon says that in fact the district court said that you chose to retire on -- in December, and you didn't appeal that finding by the district court.

2015,Campbell-Ewald Company v. Gomez,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Well, he would -- he would receive a finding of liability, which you didn't admit in your offer. He would -- he would be entitled to an injunction against that activity, the activity that caused this particular situation, and if others were shown, to an injunction in other ways. So I don't see how this could be -- putting aside the class action, putting aside the attorneys' fees, those appear to me to be fairly critical liability determinations that were not made by the court below. Why can't it -- why can't it do that in the context of a summary judgment motion? I mean, why does it have to moot the case? Wouldn't the appropriate vehicle be a summary judgment motion in which you admit the facts that make you liable, or you concede the facts that make you liable? And then you fight about the legal questions? But I -- but what's an Article III determination is whether he or it or she is entitled to the relief that they asked for. May well be they're not. But they're entitled to have the Court say it, not you. By the way, you called this a ""freestanding offer,"" but I have it right here, and it's the -- offer says, ""Offer of judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68."" This was your client's submission. So why is it that we permit relation back at all? If -- we have cases that say when a case has become moot in the middle of the litigation, it can relate back to the beginning. If mootness is mootness, mootness is mootness, right? But that's for future conduct, not -- not directed to the conduct -- the direct conduct at issue here. But I -- I -- I -- you know, I looked at the three railroad cases that you cited as proof that this has always been the case, but do you have anything besides those things? In the common law, I can't find any situation in which a court accepted a offer that wasn't accepted by the party. In the railroad cases, what they found was that an offer was made and the other side, by taking money, accepted the offer. Have you found any case in the common law that -- where there was an offer that was unaccepted, was entered by the Court? Mr. Garre, the only way that I see a Court entering judgment in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is a Rule 56 judgment. Someone moves and says, you got everything you're entitled to. The other side comes back and says, no, I'm entitled to attorneys' fees, I'm entitled to whatever. And the Court says, no, you're not, this is a full satisfaction, I enter judgment. I don't know why we have to make a merits determination based solely on an unaccepted offer of judgment. Mr. Yang, I -- I -- I do understand what you and Petitioner -- Respondent's counsel are arguing, which is someone, a judge, has to say, at some point, this is in fact complete relief and enter a judgment for that complete relief. That's your argument. All right. Parties could stipulate. If they -- if they accept an offer of settlement, that's like a stipulation saying, this is complete relief for us. There's no adversity. Right. Mr. Garre, I am so confused by your argument. You get to say on your own, unilaterally, I offered you complete relief. Even though, right or wrong, the plaintiff is asking for a particular injunction and a particular attorney's fee. You, without any judicial interpretation, intervention, get to moot the case on your terms. What happens if you hadn't done that? Let's assume that he was entitled to attorneys' fees. Who's -- when does that decision get made and by whom? That a complete offer has been made? That -- that is -- that's all I needed for you to say. Okay? Let's stop there. So a court gets involved -- a court gets involved no matter what. Right? All right. So you offered and they wanted an injunction. The Court can enter that injunction. I'm putting aside the class action. I'm -- The Court can't -- all right. But it can't just say that the case is moot and not enter the injunction. The terms of the settlement, the terms of the lawsuit, were that an injunction would be issued and you'd pay $1,500; correct? That's just -- -- four distinctive words, counselor. It can't enter a judgment -- -- unless there is jurisdiction. ",well he would he would receive a finding of liability which you do not admit in your offer he would he would be entitle to an injunction against that activity the activity that cause this particular situation and if others we be show to an injunction in other way so i do not see how this could be put aside the class action put aside the attorney fee those appear to me to be fairly critical liability determination that we be not make by the court below why can not it why can not it do that in the context of a summary judgment motion i mean why do it have to moot the case would not the appropriate vehicle be a summary judgment motion in which you admit the fact that make you liable or you concede the fact that make you liable and then you fight about the legal question but i but what be an article iii determination be whether he or it or she be entitle to the relief that they ask for may well be they be not but they be entitle to have the court say it not you by the way you call this a freestanding offer but i have it right here and it be the offer say offer of judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure this be your client s submission so why be it that we permit relation back at all if we have case that say when a case have become moot in the middle of the litigation it can relate back to the beginning if mootness be mootness mootness be mootness right but that be for future conduct not not direct to the conduct the direct conduct at issue here but i i i you know i look at the three railroad case that you cite as proof that this have always be the case but do you have anything besides those thing in the common law i can not find any situation in which a court accept a offer that be not accept by the party in the railroad case what they find be that an offer be make and the other side by take money accept the offer have you find any case in the common law that where there be an offer that be unaccepted be enter by the court mr garre the only way that i see a court enter judgment in the federal rule of civil procedure be a rule judgment someone move and say you get everything you be entitle to the other side come back and say no I be entitle to attorney fee I be entitle to whatever and the court say no you be not this be a full satisfaction i enter judgment i do not know why we have to make a merit determination base solely on an unaccepted offer of judgment mr yang i i i do understand what you and petitioner respondent s counsel be argue which be someone a judge have to say at some point this be in fact complete relief and enter a judgment for that complete relief that be your argument all right party could stipulate if they if they accept an offer of settlement that be like a stipulation say this be complete relief for us there be no adversity right mr garre i be so confused by your argument you get to say on your own unilaterally i offer you complete relief even though right or wrong the plaintiff be ask for a particular injunction and a particular attorney s fee you without any judicial interpretation intervention get to moot the case on your term what happen if you have not do that let us assume that he be entitle to attorney fee who be when do that decision get make and by whom that a complete offer have be make that that be that be all i need for you to say okay let us stop there so a court get involve a court get involve no matter what right all right so you offer and they want an injunction the court can enter that injunction I be put aside the class action I be the court can not all right but it can not just say that the case be moot and not enter the injunction the term of the settlement the term of the lawsuit we be that an injunction would be issue and you would pay correct that be just four distinctive word counselor it can not enter a judgment unless there be jurisdiction ,291.03,Roberts Court,"Oct 14, 2015",Campbell-Ewald Company,Jose Gomez,14-857,"May 18, 2015","Jan 20, 2016",113.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2015,Simmons v. Himmelreich,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Can I ask you a question? And that is -- meaning -- the only claims that are exempted under the Act are Bivens claims, which are constitutional violations. Why is it that an employee who has committed a constitutional violation is now immune from suit merely because the plaintiff's lawyer made a mistake and didn't file a Bivens claim first? I don't blame you for that, but you didn't litigate multiple times here. The exemption applied immediately, and the case was over. The Bivens claim was brought shortly thereafter. They were both simultaneously pending before the court. So if the court had elected to address the Bivens claim first, the bar would have been avoided. That still doesn't answer my point, which is, if the district court had chosen to answer the Bivens claim first, there would be no bar in place. That just means that we're -- we're giving district courts the option to foreclose or close the courtroom door, because the work is too hard to get to? Could you point out where, in that case, we explicitly addressed that language and rejected it? Let me just -- I'm sorry. How does any of this save you from an individual suit?

2015,Musacchio v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"On the basis of the argument in this case, I didn't think there was any argument that the government tried this case solely on the theory that he encourage others to exceed their authority. That's how they argued the case. That's how it was indicted. So why isn't it harmless error? It's not sufficient to support the conclusion that he exceeded authority. But it is more than sufficient, if not the only theory they could have convicted on, was that they -- that he had encouraged others to exceed their authority. My problem is that I don't know that it's rational to say that a jury in -- that sufficiency of the evidence has to do with what was charged as -- what was charged to the jury as opposed to what was laid out in the statute and/or in the indictment. If it's sufficient under both, what you're trying to say now is it may be sufficient under both. You're conceding it is. You're conceding it is a possibility the jury found what was charged in the indictment, but the government now has added an element to the crime. Do you have any case where we've held that or anything close to it? Have you had any case discussing sufficiency of the evidence where we look to the jury instruction as opposed to the statute and the indictment? The court below -- The court below -- -- is by waiver. I -- I'd like to get to the substance of your argument, but as I understand your argument, this wasn't a waiver which the court found below. You're arguing it's a forfeiture. Forfeiture because it was unintentionally done. And so you are going under plain error. All right. So you're saying when there is plain error, when there isn't an intentional -- you don't disagree with the government that there are intentional waivers that you can't raise on appeal of the statute of limitations. We've gotten a few of them here. All right. So let's assume this is under plain error. Now let's go to what -- what made this plain. Okay? We have a bunch of cases that say that this is a statute of limitations as opposed to a jurisdictional bar. Why would it be plain that this is jurisdictional? I'm sorry. I -- -- I -- I -- I'm having a very hard time accepting that argument. If we say that it -- it wasn't plain, that this was a claim-processing rule -- Let -- let -- let me -- I've been trying to break this down. Let's assume that this had been charged as ""or."" In the jury instruction. And you concede there was no evidence of the second prong of the ""exceeding authorized."" How would we look at the case then? It's not A plus B, and we know they had to have found A and B, and if they were wrong on B, they still found A. This is -- we're not sure which they did, A or B. And B is not actionable, let's just say, or there's insufficient -- But that's interesting because I -- I -- I'm not sure that that's true. My hypothetical was that B is not statutorily proper. Yes. How do you deal with his argument that we should -- if, in a civil case, we make a presumption that a statute of limitations is a claim-processing rule? In a criminal case, we should have the opposite presumption because of, A, the rule of lenity and, B, because it is on the -- a question of the power of the government. Could you summarize for me your position on three arguments he made. I -- I know the jurisdictional one. But then there's the -- -- the other two. So what would you argue if this was brought up on habeas? Let's assume counsel comes in and says, I just didn't notice it. Yes.

2015,Utah v. Strieff,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Tell me what was objectively reasonable about it. I mean, the police officer admits that the person he saw coming out of the house in question wasn't doing anything. He didn't know that he lived there, he didn't know what he had done, if anything. He didn't even really know that there was drug dealing going on in the house. He was trying to figure that out. So what was objectively reasonable about stopping this man? It would be interesting if he waited to see whether this was also a short-stay visitor. I don't see how this is any different than stopping the first person you see. What's going to stop police officers -- if we announce your rule, and your rule seems to be, once we have your name, if there's a warrant out on you, that's an attenuating circumstance under every circumstance. What stops us from becoming a police state and just having the police stand on the corner down here and stop every person, ask them for identification, put it through, and if a warrant comes up, searching them? If you have a town like Ferguson, where 80 percent of the residents have minor traffic warrants out, there may be a very good incentive for just standing on the street corner in Ferguson and asking every citizen, give me your ID; let me see your name. And let me hope, because I have an 80 percent chance that you're going to have a warrant. Don't you think it's enough of a deterrent to say to a police officer in this situation, you should have reasonable suspicion? You know the Fourth Amendment requires it. So before you do an intrusive act demanding identification, you do what you're permitted to do, which is just to ask the person whether they'll talk to you. Don't you think that that would improve the relationship between the public and the police? Wouldn't that be the appropriate encouragement we would give, if we don't let police do these things in questionable situations? We're begrudging them now from doing that. We're saying if you have questionable probable cause, go ahead and do it because we're not going to make you take that extra step of just merely stopping someone and saying, will you talk to me, please. So isn't flagrancy -- This is a non sequitur. When you talk about an intervening circumstances as we've looked at it in the case law, it's always been something different than the actual stop. Another police officer comes by and says, oh, I've been searching for that guy. I know he has -- I -- I have a -- an arrest warrant for him. A witness walks by on another crime and says, he just robbed me down the block. Those are intervening circumstances because they are something outside of the stop. This location of evidence was a direct product of the stop. It would never have happened except for the stop. Mr. -- you know something? Finding the baggie of cocaine gives the officer reasonable -- probable cause to arrest, but we don't let that cocaine come into evidence merely because it was a ground for the arrest. We look at how the evidence was secured before deciding whether it's suppressible or not. And I don't see how this is any different than not letting someone be arrested -- or suppressing DNA evidence, fingerprint evidence that leads to other crimes. We've suppressed those things because they've been the product of an illegal stop. I'm sorry. I don't understand why. If there's an arrest warrant for someone, for whatever reason, you can arrest them. What you can't do is stop them illegally to effect an arrest. So it's not as if they're going to get away from whatever the underlying crime was. There's an arrest warrant, they're going to go back and serve their time on whatever circumstance existed warranting that arrest, why are they getting away with anything? Of another crime that the police would never have found. But we do that -- But that's true of all evidence we suppress. Now you're attacking our suppression jurisprudence. We understand there's a cost to suppressing evidence. But we believe, as we've been taught by our precedents, that there is value in ensuring that the Fourth Amendment is respected. So what's our rule now? Now you don't need reasonable suspicion to stop someone. You only need questionable reasonable suspicion to stop someone. (Laughter.) And now -- so we've now lessened the standard -- the Terry stop standard, which is fairly intrusive to stop someone. I -- I suspect, and I don't know whose brief it was, yours or your -- or Petitioner's, but someone said the public will stop this if they don't like police stopping you with no cause. I think the public may end up stopping things but in a way the police are not going to like. No. But -- but we're not saying -- Now, we've gotten to the point where we no longer have reasonable suspicion at all, because you keep defending this stop. And I keep going to back to he has an anonymous call; he does see a certain number of short-stay visits, but he stops someone who he doesn't know has been a short-stay visit, has not seen there before, knows nothing about this person, and is doing a complete intrusive stop -- not just a hey, will-you-talk-to-me stop, but a formal investigatory stop -- on nothing else. Why wouldn't it? Why wouldn't it? Now, look at our case, Rodriguez case. We assumed that the check there was to ensure the safety of the officer. All right. If the stop here is purely investigatory, isn't that different? Can you have an investigatory stop based on no suspicion? You were right when you said he stopped to check for the warrant. The question is Justice Kennedy's question, which is: Is that legitimate? Yes. Without. In order to run the warrant -- You're -- There was no suspicion here. He was -- your client wasn't frisked. No. There was no activity that the officer is alleged to have seen that would put the officer in fear of any -- that this gentleman was violent or was going to turn on him or do anything else. Correct? So the purpose, as I understand what you're trying to say is, he is now routinely checking every single person that he stops, whether with or without reasonable suspicion. There can't be any other reason other than he wants to find the warrant or not. So part of the stop may be to investigate, but the other part of the stop is he's doing this routinely, with no reasonable suspicion, with no articulable fear of his -- for his own safety. He's demanding peoples' names, and he's running a warrant to do what? You're saying to find the warrant. Exactly. Well, all he did was go from the house to a convenience store, not in a car but walking. He walks to a convenience store, he's stopped in the parking garage but without a car. And I go back to this is not coming up to a parked automobile and getting shot, correct? I'm very surprised that Justice Alito doesn't know that most of these warrants are automatic. If you don't pay your fine within a certain amount of days, they're issued virtually automatically. It's routine practice to -- to run warrant checks. Every stop, legal or illegal, he says it's -- he runs warrants, on the street or in a car. Meaning, that's what the police officer testified to. So we now have a new rule. We've taken running warrants for traffic stops that we've thought were legitimate because they had to do with highway safety. Now we're saying to police officers, run warrants on any name you get because all you have to do is wave the flag of safety. ",tell me what be objectively reasonable about it i mean the police officer admit that the person he saw come out of the house in question be not do anything he do not know that he live there he do not know what he have do if anything he do not even really know that there be drug deal go on in the house he be try to figure that out so what be objectively reasonable about stop this man it would

have the police stand on the corner down here and stop every person ask them for identification put it through and if a warrant come up search them if you have a town like ferguson where percent of the resident have minor traffic warrant out there may be a very good incentive for just stand on the street corner in ferguson and ask every citizen give me your id let me see your name and let me hope because i have an percent chance that you be go to have a warrant do not you think it be enough of a deterrent to say to a police officer in this situation you should have reasonable suspicion you know the fourth amendment require it so before you do an intrusive act demand identification you do what you be permit to do which be just to ask the person whether they will talk to you do not you think that that would improve the relationship between the public and the police would not that be the appropriate encouragement we would give if we do not let police do these thing in questionable situation we be begrudge them now from do that we be say if you have questionable probable because go ahead and do it because we be not go to make you take that extra step of just merely stop someone and say will you talk to me please so be not flagrancy this be a non sequitur when you talk about an intervening circumstance as we have look at it in the case law it be always be something different than the actual stop another police officer come by and say oh I have be search for that guy i know he have i i have a an arrest warrant for him a witness walk by on another crime and say he just rob me down the block those be intervene circumstance because they be something outside of the stop this location of evidence be a direct product of the stop it would never have happen except for the stop mr you know something find the baggie of cocaine give the officer reasonable probable because to arrest but we do not let that cocaine come into evidence merely because it be a ground for the arrest we look at how the evidence be secure before decide whether it be suppressible or not and i do not see how this be any different than not let someone be arrest or suppress dna evidence fingerprint evidence that lead to other crime we have suppress those thing because they have be the product of an illegal stop I be sorry i do not understand why if there be an arrest warrant for someone for whatever reason you can arrest them what you can not do be stop them illegally to effect an arrest so it be not as if they be go to get away from whatever the underlying crime be there be an arrest warrant they be go to go back and serve their time on whatever circumstance exist warrant that arrest why be they get away with anything of another crime that the police would never have find but we do that but that be true of all evidence we suppress now you be attack our suppression jurisprudence we understand there be a cost to suppress evidence but we believe as we have be teach by our precedent that there be value in ensure that the fourth amendment be respect so what be our rule now now you do not need reasonable suspicion to stop someone you only need questionable reasonable suspicion to stop someone laughter and now so we have now lessen the standard the terry stop standard which be fairly intrusive to stop someone i i suspect and i do not know whose brief it be yours or your or petitioner s but someone say the public will stop this if they do not like police stop you with no because i think the public may end up stop thing but in a way the police be not go to like no but but we be not say now we have get to the point where we no longer have reasonable suspicion at all because you keep defend this stop and i keep go to back to he have an anonymous call he do see a certain number of short stay visit but he stop someone who he do not know have be a short stay visit have not see there before know nothing about this person and be do a complete intrusive stop not just a hey will you talk to me stop but a formal investigatory stop on nothing else why would not it why would not it now look at our case rodriguez case we assume that the check there be to ensure the safety of the officer all right if the stop here be purely investigatory be not that different can you have an investigatory stop base on no suspicion you we be right when you say he stop to check for the warrant the question be justice kennedy s question which be be that legitimate yes without in order to run the warrant you be there be no suspicion here he be your client be not frisk no there be no activity that the officer be allege to have see that would put the officer in fear of any that this gentleman be violent or be go to turn on him or do anything else correct so the purpose as i understand what you be try to say be he be now routinely check every single person that he stop whether with or without reasonable suspicion there can not be any other reason other than he want to find the warrant or not so part of the stop may be to investigate but the other part of the stop be he be do this routinely with no reasonable suspicion with no articulable fear of his for his own safety he be demand people name and he be run a warrant to do what you be say to find the warrant exactly well all he do be go from the house to a convenience store not in a car but walking he walk to a convenience store he be stop in the parking garage but without a car and i go back to this be not come up to a park automobile and get shot correct I be very surprised that justice alito do not know that most of these warrant be automatic if you do not pay your fine within a certain amount of day they be issue virtually automatically it be routine practice to to run warrant check every stop legal or illegal he say it be he run warrant on the street or in a car meaning that be what the police officer testify to so we now have a new rule we have take running warrant for traffic stop that we have think we be legitimate because they have to do with highway safety now we be say to police officer run warrant on any name you get because all you have to do be

Forbes is the only one who had a -- who had, perhaps, a live claim, but he's decided to run in another district. So how do we have a live claim or controversy? But he has decided not to run. Is he going to go back and run in the old district? Are you representing that if the map goes back to the enacted form, not the new one, that he will run in his old district?

2015,Birchfield v. North Dakota,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I'm assuming they're going to stop everybody at the border. So someone who isn't from that particular State who hasn't signed anything is still subject to the same criminal penalties. I know. Is it true that the State could prohibit driving altogether without a reason? In those cases, don't you just lose the benefit? You don't come into the building. You lose your job. Excuse me. I know we've assumed that it's only evidentiary, but in my experience, police, when they do the road test, do it because they want to confirm that you are in fact drunk. Before they take you in and take you off the road, they're doing this test as part of the probable cause evaluation: Is there enough probable cause to bring you in? There may be, independent of it, but sometimes the breath test exonerates people and they go on their merry way. So why are we thinking that it is only evidentiary? I do think the blood test is, by the way. Once you've arrested someone, you've decided to take them off the road, and the road is now safe from that person. But -- As I said, there's always -- there's probable cause, and there's probable cause. I'm meaning why can't we view it as just part of the necessity of the -- of the stop and suspicion of the stop? Well -- -- you can get a warrant. I mean, you're not left with that. You don't want the administrative expense of calling a magistrate or setting up a system to get a warrant, but it is a very powerful alternative. That's what we said in McNeely. So it's not that you don't have an out. The issue for us is: Do we dispense with a very important requirement in our law, that before you search -- particularly the inside of a person with a needle or in an intrusive way, that you get a warrant? I'm -- I'm not sure why you think you're left with nothing. They were only talked about in civil consequences; suspend the license. That's directly related to the condition that the license is given. But I -- I -- criminal sanctions are a very different thing. In scope and in effect. You're putting someone in jail; you're not taking just their license away. So that excuses you from a constitutional requirement? We're now going to bend the Fourth Amendment, which I always thought started on the presumption that we favor warrants, we don't disfavor them. But since many jurisdictions seem to manage it, we give a pass to North Dakota because it doesn't want to? If you -- If you obstruct justice by refusing to comply with the warrant, you can punish someone for the obstructing justice, and you can get the same outcome as putting them in jail for being drunk and driving. So what is it that justifies doing away with something as important as the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement? If you can do it in 15 minutes. No. What it's trying to do is get evidence of someone -- this is a pure law enforcement need. This has nothing to do, necessarily, with the safety of the community because the person's been taken off the road. And we presume that you can suspend their license. So this is something more. This is -- How long -- All right -- Blood and breath? Breath. Are they done -- But you do the breath test, then. You don't take them to -- -- do blood test. That's the practical alternative. You have two tests, bread -- breath test, blood test. You can choose precinct or hospital. Why? Let's assume -- I know my colleagues are -- but as part of this, okay, assume, as Justice Kagan did, that a system could be put in place for a warrant on a breath test. If you're doing it at the precinct, you can do it as you go there. Right now, we get dozens of consent cases where the police -- of homes, where the police tell the -- the homeowner, we're applying for a warrant. And the homeowner says, well, then I got to do it. And so the number of warrants are much less because of that. Because they know they're going to get a warrant. So if you can put a system in place for a warrant and you tell the person, if you don't take the warrant, you're going to -- if you don't do the blood -- the breath test, you're going to be charged with obstruction, what are you losing out? What's enhanceability? Why? You change the law. I mean, you know, it's as if you want us to create an exception to the Fourth Amendment, and a very drastic one, to give someone the right to say yea or nay without a warrant, but we don't permit people to say yea or nay when a warrant is present. If they don't comply, they're charged with obstruction, and there will be consequences to obstruction. I -- I -- Well, that's because you choose not to penalize obstruction at a higher level. That's your choice. We're -- we're now creating an exception to the Fourth Amendment because of your choice. I -- I appreciate that. But I'm assuming if you can get a warrant.

In your reply brief, I looked for one ARP case where the prisoner filed and the ARP itself made a determination. Is there anything in the record? Could you please tell me why you can't -- what's the purpose of this process? You have regulations and administrative handbook that says, ""Take all of these things to the ARP. Take to the IGO directly only these things."" Why don't you just say take prison brutality cases to the IGO? If you're not intending to confuse prisoners, if you're not intending to make this process totally opaque, why do you do it that way? All right. It's more confusing to say, ""If you filed a IIU, go to IGO."" If you go to ARP, if you haven't, if you have -- that's more confusing than this process where they go to ARP and they can't get anything. I have to say that when I read the Fourth Circuit decision, there are lines in the Fourth Circuit decision that seemed to be deciding this on the burden of proof. They're saying ""Ross"" -- meaning you -- ""have offered no evidence that would contradict Blake's belief that the IIU's investigation removed his complaint from the typical ARP process."" And the Fourth Circuit, that's at 787 F.3d 700. It goes on to say, moreover, that ""the handbook regulations and directives do not contradict Blake's belief that he had exhausted his administrative remedies by removing the incident to senior corrections officers, thereby initiating an IIU investigation."" That's -- that's at the same page. So I'm not sure what the Fourth Circuit was doing with availability. And so if I'm not sure, what do I do with respect to Justice Breyer's question and Justice Kennedy's question, which is, is this a availability determination?

So why don't you think that they've done the same thing under the Due Process Clause, recognizing that it is unfair to undo a conviction merely for sentencing delay because you're no longer presumed innocent, you're now guilty? Why isn't the due process test that's being applied that modification? My problem is with this use of -- of language. Prejudice is prejudice. And they -- they seem to be arguing that substantial prejudice means something like actual damages, that you can point to something that I've actually been damaged by either having served longer than the sentence that's ultimately imposed, or something else like that. But why are you even taking on the substantial damage definition? Why aren't you just arguing that prejudice is prejudice? You're still -- you're still in the Lovasco test? And that's not the way you're arguing the case. That's the problem. How do you prove -- I mean, let's take an indeterminate sentence, more or less like this one, where you have the possibility of a sentence between zero and ten years. How do you -- how does the judge know whether -- if the defendant is brought before him at year eight, eight and a half, nine, how does the judge know that if the defendant had been brought to him at year five, he would have given him a six-year sentence instead of an eight? Don't you think that there's a lot of pressure on the judge if the defendant's hearing is delayed for eight years to, say, time served? That really -- don't -- don't you think there's prejudice in the fact that an unexplained delay caused by the State more likely than not had some sort of effect on the sentence? Look, this defendant asked to be sentenced faster. He was told that there were other issues the court was dealing with. So a couple of the months were not his fault, clearly not his fault, it was an administrative fault. Well, that may go to the issue of whether, under a Barker analysis or any analysis, he should be heard to complain about the delay, but I still am not quite sure why your definition of substantial prejudice or actual prejudice should be the controlling one. Do you think the courts are -- the judges are incapable of making determinations of a remedy? Sorry, that was a forfeiture case. And that's a penalty after adjudication. The forfeiture doesn't start until someone has been found -- If we take out the ""presumed prejudice"" which is not part of the Barker analysis, it just says -- defines ""prejudice,"" how would using the Barker standard in saying, no presumed prejudice, you have to prove some prejudice, how would that change the analysis? That's for the pretrial. You think that if a defendant was writing to a judge every week saying, I'm anxious, I really need to know what my sentence is, and the judge ignores it for a period of time, that that defendant still has to prove something more? That's not the facts of this case. There was no complaint for nine months. So whatever treatment the defendant started, started -- for anxiety started well before any time had elapsed in this sentence. But you don't think that defendant is entitled to any consideration by a -- a trial court, or that we should be barring a trial court from considering that? ",mr rowley if we we be to disagree with you and say that there be no sixth amendment right and there be only a due process right have you waive any argument that you meet the due process standard well i i understand that so you be admit you be give up that its analysis under the due process clause might have be wrong i agree but why do you think lovasco applies at all meaning that be to pre indictment delay where we we be create an exception and say generally you have the state have the period of statute of limitation to bring an action if you want to cut them off from have that right you need to show actual prejudice but you be not ask us to do it in a straightforward fashion that be what justice ginsburg ask you because you be give up the barker remedy so why do not you think that they have do the same thing under the due process clause recognize that it be unfair to undo a conviction merely for sentence delay because you be no longer presumed innocent you be now guilty why be not the due process test that be be apply that modification my problem be with this use of of language prejudice be prejudice and they they seem to be argue that substantial prejudice mean something like actual damage that you can point to something that I have actually be damage by either have serve longer than the sentence that be ultimately impose or something else like that but why be you even take on the substantial damage definition why be not you just argue that prejudice be prejudice you be still you be still in the lovasco test and that be not the way you be argue the case that be the problem how do you prove i mean let us take an indeterminate sentence more or less like this one where you have the possibility of a sentence between zero and ten year how do you how do the judge know whether if the defendant be bring before him at year eight eight and a half nine how do the judge know that if the defendant have be bring to him at year five he would have give him a six year sentence instead of an eight do not you think that there be a lot of pressure on the judge if the defendant s hearing be delay for eight year to say time serve that really do not do not you think there be prejudice in the fact that an unexplained delay cause by the state more likely than not have some sort of effect on the sentence look this defendant ask to be sentence faster he be tell that there we be other issue the court be deal with so a couple of the month we be not his fault clearly not his fault it be an administrative fault well that may go to the issue of whether under a barker analysis or any analysis he should be hear to complain about the delay but i still be not quite sure why your definition of substantial prejudice or actual prejudice should be the control one do you think the court be the judge be incapable of make determination of a remedy sorry that be a forfeiture case and that be a penalty after adjudication the forfeiture do not start until someone have be find if we take out the presumed prejudice which be not part of the barker analysis it just say defines prejudice how would use the barker standard in say no presumed prejudice you have to prove some prejudice how would that change the analysis that be for the pretrial you think that if a defendant be write to a judge every week say I be anxious i really need to know what my sentence be and the judge ignore it for a period of time that that defendant still have to prove something more that be not the fact of this case there be no complaint for nine month so whatever treatment the defendant start start for anxiety start well before any time have elapse in this sentence but you do not think that defendant be entitle to any consideration by a a trial court or that we should be bar a trial court from consider that ,311.9,Roberts Court,"Mar 28, 2016",Brandon Thomas Betterman,State of Montana,14-1457,"Dec 4, 2015","May 19, 2016",113.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2015,United States v. Bryant,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"We already do that, don't we, in the career armed felony statute because we permit reliance on foreign convictions, correct? So that we already put in play the issue of whether an individual in a foreign proceeding follows due process or not. And this due process is not raised in this case at all, right -- -- by Respondent? I'm sorry. I -- I -- Well, that's the question, which is: Standing alone, was that earlier conviction violative of the Constitution? Right. And so you're not challenging that the Bill of Rights do not apply -- because we've long held that -- don't apply to Indian courts, correct? They don't apply to English courts -- -- and other foreign courts. And there are plenty of foreign courts, like England for a time -- I think it's changing it now -- where they would convict people after a magisterial inquisition where the defendant didn't have counsel. You're not saying that process violates the Constitution? You're saying simply because we're using that conviction, we now violated. Why? Nichols, as I understand it, had two rationales: One that says using a prior constitutional conviction, one that doesn't violate the Constitution, is not enhancing a sentence, is not changing that earlier conviction. It's not enhancing a sentence for that earlier conviction, so you can use it, because it's just setting the platform for the current punishment, for the conduct now. How does your argument -- why does your argument change that rationale? Well, we -- Nichols itself said enhancement statutes, whether in the nature of criminal history provisions, such as those contained in the Sentencing Guidelines, or recidivist statutes that are commonplace in State criminal law, those recidivist statutes make prior convictions an element, do not change the penalty imposed for an earlier conviction. That's what Nichols said. So the Nichols rationale covered both. Covered sentencing guidelines and covered recidivist statutes. I know, but -- Nichols said that's okay. No, it says it was relying on recidivist statutes that are commonplace in State criminal laws. All right. And those make them an element of the crime. That's the second prong of Nichols. But isn't that a due process argument? Well, that's -- ",we already do that do not we in the career arm felony statute because we permit reliance on foreign conviction correct so that we already put in play the issue of whether an individual in a foreign proceeding follow due process or not and this due process be not raise in this case at all right by respondent I be sorry i i well that be the question which be stand alone be that early conviction violative of the constitution right and so you be not challenge that the bill of right do not apply because we have long held that do not apply to indian court correct they do not apply to english court and other foreign court and there be plenty of foreign court like england for a time i think it be change it now where they would convict people after a magisterial inquisition where the defendant do not have counsel you be not say that process violate the constitution you be say simply because we be use that conviction we now violate why nichols as i understand it have two rationale one that say use a prior constitutional conviction one that do not violate the constitution be not enhance a sentence be not change that early conviction it be not enhance a sentence for that early conviction so you can use it because it be just set the platform for the current punishment for the conduct now how do your argument why do your argument change that rationale well we nichols itself say enhancement statute whether in the nature of criminal history provision such as those contain in the sentencing guideline or recidivist statute that be commonplace in state criminal law those recidivist statute make prior conviction an element do not change the penalty impose for an early conviction that be what nichols say so the nichols rationale cover both cover sentence guideline and covered recidivist statute i know but nichols say that be okay no it say it be rely on recidivist statute that be commonplace in state criminal law all right and those make them an element of the crime that be the second prong of nichols but be not that a due process argument well that be ,167.92,Roberts Court,"Apr 19, 2016",United States,"Michael Bryant, Jr.",15-420,"Dec 14, 2015","Jun 13, 2016",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2015,Puerto Rico v. Franklin California Tax-Free Trust,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Is there any compact with those other Territories that precludes them from using their Territorial power to reorganize their debts? I know that Guam and the Virgin Islands have Federal courts. And they have Federal judges. Are they subject to constitutional provisions? Is it an open question of whether they are subject to the Contract Clause as well? To the contract provision limitation, I should say? Well, that's the open issue that -- -- has to go on remand. Mr. Landau, I'm not sure I understand that argument, so you're going to have to back up a minute. It's, I think, critical to your point, which is, Justice Kagan asked a direct question: Why couldn't Congress have said much more directly, under 101, the term ""State"" includes the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico except for Chapter 9? If Puerto Rico is not a State for Chapter 9, then it couldn't have authorized its municipality to file under 109. It would have reached the same end, but more clearly saying that Puerto Rico is not a State. But in all those provisions, debtor, creditor, State play active roles in implementing the provisions of those chapters. So in all the other 40 places, the State is involved -- -- by -- inherent in the definition of what a debtor and what a creditoror is, the State has rights and responsibilities under those provisions. What you -- what I'm understanding you to say is, Puerto Rico has been kicked out of Chapter 9 altogether. It doesn't even get into the gateway. And so to read it as being involved as a State, the only other place that's used is here. In 903, you have to be part of it in some way. Mr. Landau, this is not very different from what we did in -- last year in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. the EPA. We had one general definition of a statutory term, and then we looked at it and its play within other sections, and we said can't be given the same meaning, because the definition applies to one generalized feature of the Act, and the use here is in a more specialized way. But you didn't cite Utility Air. Is there a reason you didn't? Why not treat it like -- why not treat it like every other Territory? That's the mouse in -- that's the mouse in -- in the hole -- -- which is if you're going to treat it differently, wouldn't you expect them to say that? We're going to treat it not like a State and not like a Territory. Have you given up the Government Development Bank's position and that of some of the amici that the provision of 903(1) applies to States only when a debtor is in a Chapter 9 proceeding because of that provision's use of creditor? Are you rejecting the argument? Well, no State has possessed the power to impair contract rights under the Constitution. Nothing about the Bankruptcy Code changes the application of the Contract Clause. They have to go into Chapter 9 to impair contracts -- -- in a meaningful way, correct? All right. So what makes you think that Congress intended to let Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia have free rein in whatever they wanted to do? Wouldn't they be subject, in your judgment -- I'm sure you'd be arguing they're subject to the Contract -- Impairment Clause. Exactly. So you think Congress intended to stop Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia from passing emergency legislation that said don't shut off the lights tonight; that -- that Congress intended that that kind of temporary provision could only be subject to Congress, who may be on recess, who might be wherever it is, that it could not do that? Well, it decided to overrule it by giving States the opportunity to go into bankruptcy, and that would be a temporary state to start with. And it never gave -- And it never gave the Territories that. So the Territories can pass a law that stops the lights from going out today until Congress comes into effect, because it can't do a permanent impairment of the contract. Doesn't the definitional section of the Code tell you who qualifies as a debtor, who qualifies as a creditor, who can go into what chapter or not? It tells you if you're this kind of creditor, you go into that chapter. If you're that kind of creditor, you go -- I'm sorry. If you're this kind of debtor, you go to -- individual goes here, business goes there, this one goes here. You have options. Isn't it what he describes as a gateway that tells you where you're a part or what you're a part of? Oh, but it is, because it tells you what kind of debtors can make use of what kind of provision. It is always. That's what the purpose of a gateway is. So if the -- if the definitional section defines ""State"" to include Puerto Rico, and you say even though it's not a part of Chapter 9 by definition in 109, it still remains a State for purposes of this reservation of State powers? Why aren't we using ""creditor"" in 903 as it's used in the Bankruptcy Code? If you're going to be literal as to ""State,"" why aren't you literal as to ""creditor""? But let's go back. If you're going to take the literal meaning of ""State"" definitionally, why aren't you taking the literal meaning of ""creditor""? So how do I read into the statute? Well, you actually can't do that, meaning you can't do that according to our prior precedent. It is inherent in State sovereignty that States have to have some method, their own method, of controlling their municipalities. You can have uniform bankruptcy laws, but if you don't make them available to a municipality because the State hasn't approved it, can you rob a State under State sovereignty of all power to regulate its municipality and to save it from -- from bankruptcy? Actually, so why do so many major commentators, bankruptcy writers, district and circuit courts, the Sixth Circuit included, have said that that's impossible; that you can't rob a State of the power to regulate its municipalities if you're offering it nothing in return? And then we said in Faitoute that you can't force States -- -- to go into bankruptcy. So you believe that the States that don't permit their municipality to become debtors are limited in what they can do by 903? In other words, their -- their municipalities are not debtors? Their sovereign powers have been cut off? They cannot reorganize the debt except through Chapter 9? Then we're talking about a coercive provision. We're saying you can't do anything about the composition of your debt. If 98 percent of the creditors want to reorganize their debt with you and those 2 percent vultures are saying no, and a Court would say it's not an impairment of a contract to redo this debt because of the need, everything else that we've said in the past, you're saying States can't do it if -- if -- they can only do it under Chapter 9? Assume -- I assume it doesn't. Assuming. You're saying 903 intended to preclude States, solvent States and solvent municipalities, it -- it intended to stop States from doing any reorganization of any debt, even if it doesn't impair the contract clause, it can't do it until every creditor approves, whether or not their municipality is in Chapter 9 or not? All right. And what's not coercive about that? What's the choice for States that Congress is giving? It's like the Tenth Amendment right of States to deal with their municipalities consistent with the Constitution. Where does that leave -- you can make uniform-bankruptcy laws, but nothing about that permits you to impair the rights of States so drastically? ",be there any compact with those other territory that preclude them from use their territorial power to reorganize their debt i know that guam and the virgin island have federal court and they have federal judge be they subject to constitutional provision be it an open question of whether they be subject to the contract clause as well to the contract provision limitation i should say well that

And what this expert did -- I mean, as far as I could tell, between your expert that you used to calculate ""gang time"" and ""K-time"" did exactly the same thing this expert did. You came out with a lower number, but you used fewer people. At least their expert used hundreds of people instead of the few that you did. I'm -- I'm just completely at a loss. Would you suggest that if one plaintiff came into court, that he could not use the -- this expert to prove his case circumstantially to show that in fact, the average is this, and he doesn't really know how much time he took? When he does it now, it may be 12 minutes instead of 10? Oh, no, no. But they know what they worked. They know that people were working over 40 hours because there were time records with respect to that. What you're basically saying is that Mt. Clemens is completely wrong. You can't estimate your time when the employer doesn't keep records. There were time records to that effect here. No. There were 200-and-something-odd people that their expert showed didn't work above 40 hours. The jury knew about those. I'm sorry. I'm having difficulty understanding your point. There are records, aren't there, of how many hours they worked without donning and doffing the equipment at issue, correct? All right. So I thought that Dr. Mericle's using those actual records figured out how many people worked over 40 hours. Well, you didn't have an expert to say that? Is there any -- there any -- reject -- Why do you have standing? I mean -- -- the jury, obviously, rejected something. It obviously was told to exclude people who were not entitled, and it did it. You didn't object to a -- the failure to have -- you objected to proposing interrogatories. So this has invited errors; it sounds like invited error. But, finally, how do you have standing -- -- to argue that the issue of who gets part of that money? Why? You tell me, except for those people -- -- who opted out, there are people who opted in? Opted in. So you know all of the people who are bound, all the people who've opt -- who were -- who opted in. So why do you have to know whether -- there can't be more. They were allowed to participate; they just didn't opt in. I've never heard of a case where absent class members are somehow bound by a judgment in this case, when they didn't opt in. I hope that -- I thought that was the whole purpose of not opting in, so you're not bound by this judgment. Mr. Frederick, I -- I'm not sure that you've answered the -- the two substantive questions that I see my colleagues asking, okay? With respect to whether you're a knife wielder or not, if you are assigned to -- to bear a knife during the day, you're going to be paid for that time anyway because you're on the start-to-end day, okay? So you're not going to get FSLA for that. So it's only the people who start out the day being required to don those outfits. All right. I'm -- I'm going to try to phrase what I understand the question my colleagues have been posing that I don't think either counsel has sort of gotten at, or maybe it's so obvious that we're missing it, okay? Clearly, the expert here, Dr. Joy, said -- I'm using a hypothetical -- there's 10 minutes of overtime. And the figure that comes out with 10 minutes of overtime is a million dollars. Now the jury comes back with half a million dollars. How do you know that what they said is -- I half the time -- five minutes, or the jury said, I think it's eight minutes or -- for slaughterhouse and three for production line people. So it averages out to five now, okay? How do we know what -- how the jury calculated that half million? That's what my colleagues are saying. So the question is, your adversary is claiming that there might be some people on the three-minute side who are going to come and collect a pro rata share who really weren't injured because they had worked 39 hours and 57 -- 56 minutes, something like that. So why is it that it's fair to distribute this -- this award pro rata? Didn't they standardize walking time? That's what I thought they used. There's a standardized walking time because some people are faster than others, correct?

But assuming we disagree with you that this should be appealable, what's the narrowest way to right this that the government would like? Mr. Stewart, in regular litigation, there is an inducement, potentially, for one or other party to appeal to delay the resolution of the case. In this situation, I don't see that inducement as existing, meaning I doubt very much that landowners are -- who wanted to use their property for a particular purpose are going to appeal just for the -- just to delay the government's adjudication of an issue that's going to either permit them or not permit them to go forward. Well, I -- Yes. Go ahead. That doesn't help you for very long, because he just said they'll change it. So is that the argument that you want to rely on? He just said before that if we rule that way, they could change it. They'll just eliminate the MOA. How do I determine how much is too much? I mean, for some people, given their financial situation, $3,000 is too much. And for others -- I don't know your client's financial wherewithal, but 10,000 would be reasonable. So when do we decide how much is too much? ",well that be fine give me an example of a case where the government have go after someone absent change circumstance who be have a negative jd in hand any situation past pre memorandum post memorandum where where you have actually take the army corp determination and say we be go to go after this person anyway the fact that you be reserve your power be enough even though by this memo and practice you have never do it you think that that be not within bennett s second prong mr stewart may i ask you please do not panic by ask this question and please do not resist it because i know all your argument resist it but assume we disagree with you that this should be appealable what be the narrow way to right this that the government would like mr stewart in regular litigation there be an inducement potentially for one or other party to appeal to delay the resolution of the case in this situation i do not see that inducement as exist mean i doubt very much that landowner be who want to use their property for a particular purpose be go to appeal just for the just to delay the government s adjudication of an issue that be go to either permit them or not permit them to go forward well i yes go ahead that do not help you for very long because he just say they will change it so be that the argument that you want to rely on he just say before that if we rule that way they could change it they will just eliminate the moa how do i determine how much be too much i mean for some people give their financial situation be too much and for others i do not know your client s financial wherewithal but would be reasonable so when do we decide how much be too much ,135.34,Roberts Court,"Mar 30, 2016",United States Army Corps of Engineers,"Hawkes Co., Inc., et al.",15-290,"Dec 11, 2015","May 31, 2016",113.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2015,Duncan v. Owens,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Let's assume the judge said, instead of what he said -- so make the assumption my way -- I don't know if the witnesses are telling the truth or not, but I believe he's guilty. I'm not sure about their credibility, but I believe he's guilty because he wanted to get rid of this guy because of a -- a drug deal gone bad. Would that violate due process? Well, this isn't speculation. The judge said who -- Larry Owens knew he was a drug dealer; Larry Owens wanted to knock him off; I think the State's evidence has proved that fact; finding of guilty of murder. Proved that Larry Owens wanted to knock him off? I'm not sure -- you know, the problem is that you're making an allegation I'm not sure about. They had trouble with one of the witnesses. They wrote it. Correct? All right. So that leaves it to a one-witness ID of a witness who -- who, at best, saw the defendant once, when he turned around to leave the scene for a few seconds. Right. I mean, once. Fleeting look. How can you draw a reasonable inference that the judge wasn't troubled by the witnesses when he says I think all of the witnesses skirted the real issue. Well, except that evidence failed to identify him in court. It's pretty easy to -- to identify a defendant in court. They sit next to the defense attorney. I've always thought it's been a wonderfully -- a ritual with no meaning. But putting that aside, I guess my question is: You say that Johnnie's testimony was sufficient. I don't disagree with that. But what they didn't say was that it was credible, or that the judge found it credible. Those are two different findings. No. All the judge had to say was, I'm not sure he's credible. And what takes me over the line is this motivation, this theory that I have. This is quite interesting. You can draw an inference about a defendant based on no evidence. No one said he was a drug dealer, I presume. Did he have any convictions for drug dealing? He did not. So the judge could just make this up out of whole cloth. And that's not extraneous evidence. That's a new theory. I didn't read that in your brief, that somehow, the judge was right. He can -- he can assume that Owens knew that the defendant was a drug dealer. There's a new trial that was necessitated by the judge's death, correct? The judge who passed -- -- who made the findings? And -- -- in Taylor -- ",let us assume the judge say instead of what he say so make the assumption my way i do not know if the witness be tell the truth or not but i believe he be guilty I be not sure about their credibility but i believe he be guilty because he want to get rid of this guy because of a a drug deal go bad would that violate due process well this be not speculation the judge say who larry owens know he be a drug dealer larry owens want to knock him off i think the state s evidence have prove that fact finding of guilty of murder prove that larry owens want to knock him off I be not sure you know the problem be that you be make an allegation I be not sure about they have trouble with one of the witness they write it correct all right so that leave it to a one witness id of a witness who who at best saw the defendant once when he turn around to leave the scene for a few second right i mean once fleet look how can you draw a reasonable inference that the judge be not trouble by the witness when he say i think all of the witness skirt the real issue well except that evidence fail to identify him in court it be pretty easy to to identify a defendant in court they sit next to the defense attorney I have always think it be be a wonderfully a ritual with no meaning but put that aside i guess my question be you say that johnnie s testimony be sufficient i do not disagree with that but what they do not say be that it be credible or that the judge find it credible those be two different finding no all the judge have to say be I be not sure he be credible and what take me over the line be this motivation this theory that i have this be quite interesting you can draw an inference about a defendant base on no evidence no one say he be a drug dealer i presume do he have any conviction for drug dealing he do not so the judge could just make this up out of whole cloth and that be not extraneous evidence that be a new theory i do not read that in your brief that somehow the judge be right he can he can assume that owens know that the defendant be a drug dealer there be a new trial that be necessitate by the judge s death correct the judge who pass who make the finding and in taylor ,177.92999999999995,Roberts Court,"Jan 12, 2016",Stephen Duncan,Lawrence Owens,14-1516,"Oct 1, 2015","Jan 20, 2016",113.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2015,Zubik v. Burwell,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Could you explain to me the analogy with military objectors during the war? Many of them felt that -- genuine belief; they were pacifists -- that if they registered as pacifists, that that would mean other people would have to serve in their lieu. They were going to jail, and many of them did go to jail, because of this belief. Why is going to jail less burdensome or less important than paying a financial penalty? Let's stop there. To the extent that a conscientious objector's good faith belief is that, ""If I register, someone will serve in my lieu,"" what burden is it on the government? Meaning, if -- if you're looking at it in terms of strict scrutiny, the government sends out how many notices to people to come and serve? Ten -- you know, 1,000, 1,200. Do you really think it makes a difference if it knows whether or not one person is not going to show up? And if we're going down that road of what's the difference, why would that law survive? Well, then, isn't that the same thing here? If you don't know who can pay, or who -- who's not eligible, or who's eligible to pay, how does this system work? The churches have to tell us that their church plans -- have to tell the government their church plans. Somebody has to tell the government who's eligible or not eligible. How is that different from military service? Well, but the client, then -- What I don't understand, Mr. Clement, is when will any government law that someone claims burdens their practice ever be insubstantial? Because every believer that's ever come before us, including the people in the military, are saying that my soul will be damned in some way. I'm not naysaying that that is a very substantial perceived personal burden by them. But if that's always going to be substantial, how will we ever have a government that functions? How will we ever have anything that the government can demand people to do in objecting -- -- that won't be a problem? Well, it's the side of the debate that settles, which is if we are not asking you to do anything except identify yourself, and if who is going to do the action is either the government or a third party, that that's the balance that we have struck, that it's not a substantial burden if someone else is going to do the act that you're objecting to. Well, we could also just -- why don't we assume that if they are part of the -- if the majority are part of the religion, that they are not going to buy contraceptives? That's their religious tenet. And so why are we worried about this case at all? We are worried because there are some women who don't adhere to that particular religious tenant, and who have -- we perceive the government has determined, have a real need for contraceptives. What is the utter absence? there is plenty of evidence that was relied upon to show that when contraceptives are provided to women in a seamless way, that the number of unintended pregnancies dramatically falls, as does the number of abortions. And so that health risk to women who want contraceptives who can't get it is proven, scientifically and otherwise. But you know that we exempt certain employers of certain size from Title VII, and it's not because we don't believe that racial discrimination is a bad thing, and it's not that we're not committed to eradicating that problem, but because at a certain point, we have assumed as a society, or as a government, that you can't do everything. So you can't take care of the health needs of a hundred percent of women, but you can of a significant number. Why is that a judgment that is not entitled to some respect? So your answer to Justice Kagan is wrong. Basically you're saying, even if all you do is an opt-out, I raise my hand, I tell you that I'm a religious objector, and they somehow, from this suit, they know who your third-party administrator is, they have a general law that requires now all ERISA plans and insurance companies to tell them who their clients are; that if your insurer is involved in any way, you object? General, can we go back to the substantial burden question? And I think that Justice Breyer has been talking about how to draw this line. When is it that government has to act to accommodate, and when doesn't it have to act to accommodate? There is some amici that have suggested a line that at least to me helps draw some clarity to the cases, our cases, which is, if what your religious belief is asking the government to do is to change its behavior with respect -- its regulatory behavior with respect to others, then it can't be a substantial burden, because we live in a pluralistic society in which government has to function. And hence, you're a military objector. You can't tell the government, no, you can't draft someone else. You have to -- you can't spend your money on war. We don't have to use you to promote the war. But if you want to use others to promote the war, you're entitled to do that as government. Does this line make any sense to you? Because here, what the religious groups I understand are asking is the government not to use its regulatory power with third parties who don't have a religious objection, and forcing a burden on the women who its trying to help, third parties that don't have the same religious objection, and burdening them to do other things. They're not on the Exchanges. That's a falsehood. The Exchanges require full-service health insurance policies with minimum coverages that are set forth that are very comprehensive. We're creating a new program. General, the -- we've used -- the hijack analogy has been mentioned. Can you explain why you don't see this as a hijacking? Mr. Francisco, I think, earlier said if Aetna offers a separate policy giving insurance, that he thought that that would be an adequate -- an adequate accommodation. No, no. I meant -- I meant: He says, generally, if Aetna, under some other policy, offers it on the Exchange to women who might want to go on the Exchange and buy that policy, that's okay if they -- if that's the -- what they do. What's different from that from what happens here? It's basically the same thing, isn't it? Well, it is two policies instead of one because the contraceptives are being provided by government regulation. The only seamlessness is that I think the woman doesn't have to apply and pay separately or something else. Would it have been better to say, churches, you've got to tell us you're going to claim an exemption, because not every church is religious, has the same religious tenets. So is that what you would have preferred? Is that the -- the sort of incentive you want to put out there? Is that the message you're giving, which is, there is lots of rules that apply differently to churches because we recognize they are special? Others may be special like them, but it's clear to tell what a church is. ",could you explain to me the analogy with military objector during the war many of them felt that genuine belief they we be pacifist that if they register as pacifist that that would mean other people would have to serve in their lieu they we be go to jail and many of them do go to jail because of this belief why be go to jail less burdensome or less important than pay a financial penalty

2015,Montgomery v. Louisiana,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"So why don't we have jurisdiction to answer that question? How do you differentiate this case from Standard Oil? But we did say that that State could define the exemption any which way it wanted. And so it could -- it's almost identical here; we would announce what the Federal law is, send it back. The State has already said it's going to follow Teague, but I guess it might or might not be free to change its mind about doing that. You're not in. Are you asking us to decide the question left -- left open in Danforth? Danforth said that it was a minimum -- there could be a constitutional minimum, but it wasn't answering that question. Are you asking us to answer that question? But let's assume we -- all right. Mr. Dreeben, what's the problem -- Could you -- Mr. Dreeben, how do you explain how your articulation of your test wouldn't apply to the guideline changes in Booker that we made? What is the substantive difference -- pardon the use of that word -- between your formulation and Petitioner's formulation? He says, this is substantive because it did away with mandatory life imprisonment. You're articulating it slightly different. Tell me what you see as the difference and why your articulation. Could you tell me why you would think that something like Atkins would not be retroactive to States? As a compulsion, meaning not as by election of Teague retroactivity. It has to do something different because, as Justice Breyer pointed out, you have wide discretion to structure it as you want. But if you structured it in a way that you're going to say ""I'm offering due process,"" isn't there a check, a substantive check by due process -- -- that you have to offer the minimum? But we have any number of cases where States have viewed the exceptions as controlling the fact that they have to offer the constitutional minimum. Hasn't yet. And why shouldn't we? That's really the serious question. Mr. Winsor -- Mr. Winsor -- -- I know that we didn't ever look at this issue. I'm sorry. Reading the wrong one. I apologize. But do you really think that we -- that any State would have not applied Woodson retroactively? They all did. Why? It just said you couldn't have mandatory death penalties.

2015,Molina-Martinez v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I -- I don't think I understand the difference between general and specific. Evidence is evidence. And you draw inferences from all sorts of circumstances. So I don't know why you call this general. It's evidence. Okay? Let's assume the Guideline was 70 to 100. The erroneous Guideline was 80 to 100, and the right Guideline was 70 to 100. Would we -- you draw a general inference that the corrected Guideline would have made any difference on that sentence? So what changed the judge's mind in terms of the facts? He gave you the max when it was 80 to 100. What's going to change his mind about 70 to 100? Let's assume I don't believe there's a presumption, okay? It's very hard for me to understand what difference between 70 and 100 and 80 and 100 could make. In this case, I have a difficulty understanding what difference the -- the Criminal History Category would make. But I'll give you another example of overlapping Guidelines: a defendant who's never committed a crime and a defendant who has committed a crime. I would be more inclined to say that an inference from the facts is that a defendant who's never been committed of a crime, that the judge might take that into consideration, even in an overlapping Guideline case, and send it back. Because we don't know how much mercy that judge might have shown. But if a defendant like yours has many criminal convictions, I'd be pretty close to saying I don't think he's going to make much of a different choice. But these -- I see -- I see -- You know, so much of this is the use of that word ""assumptions,"" ""presumptions""; but both sides are doing it. This case came up because the Third Circuit has a presumption that if a corrected -- it -- it says it: We assume that if Guidelines overlap, the wrong Guideline and the right Guideline overlap, that there is no way -- we assume there's no way you can prove error, or that it affected substantial rights. And there are a number of circuits who have said that. Overlapping Guidelines, you can never prove. That -- that seems that that's an assumption that's wrong, under your articulation of plain-error review. So let's go to Justice Alito's point. The more concrete here is that the parties were fighting about extremes. Sentence him, the government said, to the high end. The defendant was arguing he's entitled to the low end. There is some additional proof there. The judge picks the low end. If the Guideline is an anchor, which I think is almost undisputed, isn't that enough to say it affected substantial rights? Except the judge -- -- knew that he could have departed upwards under the old Guideline, because this criminal history was pretty serious. You argued he was entitled to the -- to the -- and should sentence at the upper end, and yet the judge sentenced him at the low end. So the -- the criminal history has less effect on the judge than it has on you, or perhaps on me. ",i i do not think i understand the difference between general and specific evidence be evidence and you draw inference from all sort of circumstance so i do not know why you call this general it be evidence okay let us assume the guideline be to the erroneous guideline be to and the right guideline be to would we you draw a general inference that the correct guideline would have make any difference on that sentence so what change the judge s mind in term of the fact he give you the max when it be to what be go to change his mind about to let us assume i do not believe there be a presumption okay it be very hard for me to understand what difference between and and and could make in this case i have a difficulty understand what difference the the criminal history category would make but I will give you another example of overlap guideline a defendant who be never commit a crime and a defendant who have commit a crime i would be more inclined to say that an inference from the fact be that a defendant who be never be commit of a crime that the judge might take that into consideration even in an overlapping guideline case and send it back because we do not know how much mercy that judge might have show but if a defendant like yours have many criminal conviction I would be pretty close to say i do not think he be go to make much of a different choice but these i see i see you know so much of this be the use of that word assumption presumption but both side be do it this case come up because the third circuit have a presumption that if a correct it it say it we assume that if guideline overlap the wrong guideline and the right guideline overlap that there be no way we assume there be no way you can prove error or that it affect substantial right and there be a number of circuit who have say that overlap guideline you can never prove that that seem that that be an assumption that be wrong under your articulation of plain error review so let us go to justice alito s point the more concrete here be that the party we be fight about extreme sentence him the government say to the high end the defendant be argue he be entitle to the low end there be some additional proof there the judge pick the low end if the guideline be an anchor which i think be almost undisputed be not that enough to say it affect substantial right except the judge knew that he could have depart upwards under the old guideline because this criminal history be pretty serious you argue he be entitle to the to the and should sentence at the upper end and yet the judge sentence him at the low end so the the criminal history have less effect on the judge than it have on you or perhaps on me ,210.17,Roberts Court,"Jan 12, 2016",Saul Molina-Martinez,United States,14-8913,"Oct 1, 2015","Apr 20, 2016",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2015,Luna Torres v. Lynch,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"There -- this -- this provision applies to an entire list of multiple crimes, right? And so for most of those crimes there is no jurisdictional element at all. So if you're looking at this as superfluous to not this individual subprovision, one subprovision of many -- -- it's doing a lot of work. It's doing a lot of work because there are a lot of other crimes that qualify under State law, correct? I mean, your brief and the Solicitor General's sort of tunnel in on this one provision of many. But I'm wondering why? I'm looking at the entire provision has many State court analogues that don't involve interstate commerce, correct? On those other -- the ones that are not stated in the statute, it's presumed. It doesn't have to be proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, correct? Can I have -- I'm going to sound like my colleague, Justice Breyer. I became interested in the argument of the National Association of Criminal Lawyers. And basically, their position is that the definition here that says, an offense described in 844 -- what -- of that title, relating to explosive material offenses. And they argue that that takes arson out of this section. Why -- I don't see that argument in your brief. Are you disavowing it? And if so, why? I'm not -- I'm not even on your point. All right. Did you read the National Association -- All right. They don't argue that point at all. They're just saying that this -- this is not covered by -- the fire, the arson is not covered by the statute at all by the enhancement -- by the statute at all, except under the arson provision that requires a sentence for a year. That's their argument. Forget about interstate or anything else. So tell me why you didn't make that argument. All these examples you gave me in your brief, either it's clear explicitly that jurisdiction was excluded by the statute or the nature of the offense gives jurisdiction or the Assimilated Crimes Act, it makes sense, because the whole purpose is that it's -- that Federal -- that a State law is going to apply when there isn't a Federal law. So applying jurisdiction makes no sense. But -- so I don't take much from your arguments, which is the fact that it drops away in other sections. Congress didn't just say it dropped away here. Isn't -- go ahead. Well, I -- I don't know why you say that, if it has to have substantive work, otherwise it wouldn't be in the statute. It -- it is picking a crime that only Congress would prosecute, which is following up on Justice Alito's point, substantive because it's more serious.

You could -- even following the model penal code, you could still call this substantive. I'm sorry. Can you give me the number again? Well, we -- I can't square this with the categorical approach. I -- I -- you know, we've been very clear. The categorical approach says, every element of a crime that has to be proven to a jury has to be included in the State offense. But now you're saying it's every categorical element that's not jurisdictional. Where do you get that from? What do you do with -- if we rule your way, that it won't address the child pornography possession laws or that it won't address some of the explosion laws? No, I want to know where the overlap is for the child pornography.

What right, if we say there isn't the First Amendment? Well, if we say it doesn't exist. You lose this case. Just that, the right you're claiming. We're off on a tangent because there's no injury in this situation when a law doesn't go into effect. But coming back to what Justice Breyer, I believe, is attempting to say -- (Laughter.) I don't know, Mr. Goldstein, that I understand either. And I think Justice Kagan asked you this. Why does it matter -- and we don't care whether someone is a Republican or not in Elrod and Branti and those cases -- and you say it's only because it's a policy. The intent of the government is to say I'm not going to promote anybody who is not a Democrat or not a Republican. Well, someone, they have come along and not promoted people. All right? So you have to have someone come in and say I'm not a Democrat? I'm not a -- -- Republican? Or you need someone to tell you what they are?

2015,"Hughes v. Talen Energy Marketing, LLC",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"But -- but I have to say that they also looked at a long-term contract -- FERC did, and PJM -- in the PJM Interconnection order, and it determined that a seven-year lock-in period for a new generator was unfair, unjust and unreasonable. It's something it can do. Why didn't that end what you're doing? You're arguing that you're not affecting price. FERC disagrees, because you have no incentive to bid anything other than zero. I don't understand why this case is not ended by FERC's determination that locked-in contracts are unjust and unreasonable. How is it different than your contract? I know the years are different, but I'm talking about the mechanics. I'm sorry. How would this -- How would this work normally? Meaning forget that a lawsuit was started. You enter into this contract. Do you have to submit the contract to FERC? But a protest here? Mr. Clement, can you tell me how I write this opinion? And I'll ask you why. As I look at the relevant statutory provisions, what it says is that FERC has the power to ensure that rates that are set are fair, are just and reasonable. So it doesn't say it gets to set the rates. It says it can do rules and regulation that control how the rates are set so that I'm not sure how this is field preemption. At best, I think it might be conflict preemption. And so if I think it's conflict preemption, that something about Maryland's plan conflicts with the system that FERC has set in place, how do I articulate the rule in this case? What is it that conflicts with FERC's rules and regulations with respect to setting -- participating in the market -- in the auction? Because as I understand it, and I don't think you -- you've told me any differently, that the people who are auctioning in the market can and do enter into contracts with States on a regular basis. Exactly. All right. Voluntary contracts outside the market. Why is this involuntary? Because of the State -- All right. So is that what conflicts? I'm -- I'm trying to articulate the preemption rule in some simplified way. I'm a little bit like Justice Breyer on this. I'm not quite sure how everything is working, but I don't think it can be field preemption, because you have to explain what field we're talking about and what rule we're setting in the future. I think it's conflict preemption. So give me a simple -- sir, when I write this opinion -- -- give me -- give me the first paragraph. This conflicts with what? So that's the conflict? That's -- that's because -- you're articulating it as -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- that the conflict is in affecting the bid price in any way. Requiring it, affecting it, or -- -- determining it. But for -- that -- that answers the earlier question: No, they can't give money to build a generator because that changes the incentives.

2015,Halo Electronics v. Pulse Electronics Inc.,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Tell me how you articulate this. And I ask because the SG is talking about describing it as egregious conduct. You're saying something about willfulness and recklessness. And I don't know if this is all a matter of semantics, but I think the SG is right. Even if you give discretion to the district courts to make a judgment of when to enhance penalties, we have to give them some guidance. It can't be that they can give enhanced penalties on whim. All right? So if it's not whim, what is it? How do we articulate a test that protects what Justice Breyer is concerned about, which I think is a legitimate concern, but doesn't entrench a position that just favors you? And by that, I mean, you know -- So how do -- Help me -- No, but that -- that -- -- you know, that these tests understands life a little -- is more -- -- complex than that. Okay? Because you can often use the conduct of someone, after the time, to reflect what they thought. And so if you're saying that someone is withholding information, you might be able to infer that there wasn't good faith at the beginning. So your articulation doesn't really give life to the complexity of this inquiry. This is all the Read Corporation factors that the district court here did in the Stryker case. I don't want to adopt that test. How do I articulate this in a more generalized way? That avoids the use of the word ""willfulness."" That avoids the use of the word ""willfulness."" But the bucket is there. Why isn't that post hoc defense necessarily -- you're almost reading it as unreasonable, by definition. I'm sorry. Doesn't the statute exempt out enhanced damages for pending applications? So why are you here? Mr. Phillips, I -- I -- there's a whole lot of worry articulated by Justice Breyer and reflected in your briefs about protecting innovation. But there's not a whole lot of worry about protecting the patent owner. I can't forget that historically enhanced damages were automatic, and they were automatic because of a policy judgment that owning a patent entitled you to not have people infringe willfully or not willfully. And I accept that at some point there was a different judgment made that -- that good-faith infringers should be treated differently than other infringers, willful infringers. But I don't know that that swung things so far the other way that it can only be that, if you come up with something, any defense whatsoever in the litigation that's not frivolous, that that gets you out of enhanced damages. If I'm there -- If I'm there -- -- and I don't think that the Seagate test is -- is -- is appropriate but I am still in the balance of how do we get -- -- a similar protection without an artificial test that I don't think is right -- -- where -- where do I go?

I -- I mean, most of the common law rights, like property rights, are -- are given to you by statute. They're not given to you by the common law. Most people are coming in to sue on the basis of a statute. So if I have a dozen or more cases that didn't involve property rights, where we didn't require economic harm, those would mean nothing to you? Those legal rights, we just decided through the centuries, all those cases wrong? Isn't that -- Isn't that, though, a question of the application of the statute? It doesn't invalidate the injury here because this is the quintessential violation of the statute. He's saying they don't have reasonable procedures to check their accuracy. We know from the purpose section of the statute that that's what Congress wanted, reasonable procedures. He's going to have to prove that. Number two, he says, the information about me is false. I'm going to assume, for purposes of this argument, because we have to, that -- and so does the court below with respect to standing -- that much of that information is inaccurate. I will tell you that I know plenty of single people who look at whether someone who's proposed to date is married or not. So if you're not married and there's a report out there saying you are, that's a potential injury. Now, I know the court below said it was speculative, but that's what Congress was worried about: both creditworthiness, and -- and your stature as a person, your privacy, your sense of self; that I can identify myself with some -- others can identify me with some accuracy. So I guess my question is, we've now taken a word, ""concreteness,"" that the Court in recent years has applied to injuries by citizens and when they can bring actions or not. A generalized grievance, we said, of a taxpayer is not concrete enough. We've taken this doctrine, and you're trying to superimpose the word ""concrete"" into legally-created rights. But for -- for two decades -- on, I mean, two centuries, we've always said in our case law that injury in fact is the breach of a legally-recognized right. Where do we have a right? I think that's Justice Kagan's question. It's a requirement. ""Any person who willfully fails to comply with any requirement imposed upon this subjecter with respect to any consumer is liable to that consumer."" So it's not the whole world; it's the consumer that you dealt with -- -- or that the agency -- that the agency dealt with. Isn't there always a materiality question? In every violation there's always a materiality question: What is the falsehood? Is it material to anything? It could be a transposition of a telephone number. So are we ruling on the outcome or are we ruling on the reasoning? I think -- See, I look at this case slightly differently. I think the breach of any legal right you're given is -- gives Article III jurisdiction. There is a difference between that and whether you're within the zone of interest of a statute. And so what you're saying -- I -- I guess that's why the circuits below have said you have to be able to allege some falsity in the credit report to get recovery under the statute because those are the people the statute was targeted to. But here you -- ",I be sorry you be say contrary to one citation your ashley ashby v white that it be not a right that congress have give you i i mean most of the common law right like property right be be give to you by statute they be not give to you by the common law most people be come in to sue on the basis of a statute so if i have a dozen or more case that do not involve property right where we do not require economic harm those would mean nothing to you those legal right we just decide through the century all those case wrong be not that be not that though a question of the application of the statute it do not invalidate the injury here because this be the quintessential violation of the statute he be say they do not have reasonable procedure to check their accuracy we know from the purpose section of the statute that that be what congress want reasonable procedure he be go to have to prove that number two he say the information about me be false I be go to assume for purpose of this argument because we have to that and so do the court below with respect to stand that much of that information be inaccurate i will tell you that i know plenty of single people who look at whether someone who be propose to date be marry or not so if you be not marry and there be a report out there say you be that be a potential injury now i know the court below say it be speculative but that be what congress be worry about both creditworthiness and and your stature as a person your privacy your sense of self that i can identify myself with some others can identify me with some accuracy so i guess my question be we have now take a word concreteness that the court in recent year have apply to injury by citizen and when they can bring action or not a generalized grievance we say of a taxpayer be not concrete enough we have take this doctrine and you be try to superimpose the word concrete into legally create right but for for two decade on i mean two century we have always say in our case law that injury in fact be the breach of a legally recognize right where do we have a right i think that be justice kagan s question it be a requirement any person who willfully fail to comply with any requirement impose upon this subjecter with respect to any consumer be liable to that consumer so it be not the whole world it be the consumer that you deal with or that the agency that the agency dealt with be not there always a materiality question in every violation there be always a materiality question what be the falsehood be it material to anything it could be a transposition of a telephone number so be we rule on the outcome or be we rule on the reasoning i think see i look at this case slightly differently i think the breach of any legal right you be give be give article iii jurisdiction there be a difference between that and whether you be within the zone of interest of a statute and so what you be say i i guess that be why the circuit below have say you have to be able to allege some falsity in the credit report to get recovery under the statute because those be the people the statute be target to but here you ,248.13,Roberts Court,"Nov 2, 2015","Spokeo, Inc.",Thomas Robins,13-1339,"Apr 27, 2015","May 16, 2016",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

You always have to decide the bottom line. Mr. Smith, what is -- what's -- what are you asking us to do in this case? What's the disposition that you're seeking? Are we supposed to say Eighth Circuit, you're wrong, it has nothing to do with -- exclusively with the merits? Do a do-over? So why should we decide this? Assuming we reverse, why don't we leave it to the court below to decide whether they will, in fact, entertain the government's new argument because there might be a waiver of that, or whether there's a factual predicate for it at all? You see, I found -- Why do we apply the same standard to a defendant? The plaintiff is seeking a change of the status quo, but a defendant is actually -- all they want is the status quo. They want just to stay -- not to be found liable. So why do we apply the question of whether there's been a legal change between the parties? The defendant was never seeking that. It's hard to imagine that the district court didn't consider this a dismissal with prejudice when it announced in this very decision you're pointing to that the -- that the Petitioner was a prevailing party entitled to attorneys' fees at the end of the case. Certainly the district court thought it was imposing a sanction. It was barring you from trying these cases, at least at this trial. Well, the -- -- the real problem for you is that any -- the dismissal of the action, even according to this order by the court, would happen at the end of the case. And at the end of this case we had a dismissal with prejudice. One would think that everything would get merged into the final judgment. What is the rule that you would like us to announce?

2015,Encino Motorcars v. Navarro,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"That's every employee. That's every employee who's salaried. They -- if they want a job, it's a job, and unless the law protected them, no employer would pay overtime. I don't know how I can take from the fact that service advisors accept what's given to them because they have no choice, why they prefer not to have overtime. But, Mr. Clement, those courts were before Chevron. So you know, I take less value in what the courts said because every one of them said the provision was ambiguous. They just thought that the better argument -- this was before Chevron -- favored your interpretation. So I'm -- I'm not quite sure that -- that it's accurate to point to those older cases as supporting your position unequivocally. I have a very practical question. Are these sales advisors specially trained in some way? Do they go to mechanic -- mechanic school? Do they -- how are they trained? Because, to be candid with you, it scares me to think that every time I take my car to a dealer, that a non-mechanic is telling me what's wrong with it. Well -- Were -- in 1966, were there service advisors in existence? And were they paid the same way as now? Were they salaried, or commissioned? I went to the Dictionary of Occupations, which was in existence in 1966, and it appears to have different entries for salesmen, service advisors, partsmen, mechanic. Do I read something from the fact that -- or should I read something, or why can't I read something -- from the fact that Congress knew that these different positions existed, they were defined in the Dictionary of Occupations differently, and it decided to use only ""salesmen,"" which under the dictionary meant a salesperson of cars; a ""partsmen,"" which was defined the way one would think; and a ""mechanic,"" but it didn't include sales advisors. But they thought it important. The partsmen could arguably service automobiles because they provide the parts for the automobile, yet Congress found the need to be explicit and to add partsmen. Why wouldn't it have -- if it's intended to include service advisors as opposed to mechanics and partsmen, why didn't it use that occupational term? It's a term of art. Except the dictionary doesn't use the words -- the functions as functions of selling a car. And -- and it doesn't use the word ""service"" in a traditional sense. It says it's going to evaluate cars, it's going to give the work to mechanics, but it doesn't use the word ""servicing"" a car. The occupational handbook. Could you give me the pages where it's in your brief? The salesman -- It was more of Justice Alito's. When did automobile salesmen travel? When did mechanics and partsmen for automobile leave the -- the job -- So is it okay if we just send it back? They've already conceded there's not. So they're -- they're not going to claim any.

No, it looked at the operative paragraphs. Why should -- The operative paragraphs here are the causes of action. Without the Federal law, would there be a duty under State law not to short sell? Please go back to answer my direct question: If there were no Federal law. Isn't that what the court is going to do when it hears this action? Isn't that what the State court's going to do when it hears this action? There's nothing about the alleged causes of action -- they allege theft and fraud. So they're going to have to prove theft and fraud under State law as defined in the sections that they've cited. All of that. Now, that might be something you could object to at trial if they try to say State law is the same as Federal law and can't prove it. You then appeal that decision if it's wrong.

2015,Luis v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I have the -- So you really don't have a statutory argument. You're making a Sixth Amendment argument because if it were a statutory argument, it would be you can -- you can restrain -- you can't restrain untainted assets. I guess I'm -- I understand what you're going to say because I read your brief. But the logic of your argument would suggest that you can't freeze untainted assets for anything, because you're saying the government has no property right to it. It's untainted. It's your money; it's not their money until they secure a judgment. And so the logic of your position would be, I think, they can't restrain untainted assets, period, constitutionally or statutorily. I know you don't because it's very nice that you limit it. But once we announce a rule, we have to carry it to its logical conclusion. And if the rule is it's untainted assets and it belongs to me, how do we then limit it? I know this is not part of the question asked, but I know that it -- it's suggested in the fringes of the briefs. How does the district court ensure that she doesn't use every penny for defense costs when the district court thinks that that's not reasonable, for example? Well, we have a new statute. 853 made a difference between -- and still does -- between tainted and untainted. This section came later, and it says substitute property. Do you really -- Kaley was a question of tracing, because it was -- But you don't have any tracing problem here. As soon as he commits a crime that you say was worth $45 million, you can freeze $45 million worth of assets, correct? I respect that, and -- but -- but you agreed that these particular funds were untainted. I'm told by your adversary -- Mr. Dreeben, you're taking Monsanto out of context, because 853, by its nature, was limited to tainted funds. This is the first statute if -- that I know of that permits the government to come in and take untainted funds. The incidence of the tainted funds concept was, you can't spend another person's money. You stole this money somehow, and you can't spend that money because it belongs to someone else. It really doesn't belong to you. But it's not until a judgment -- and this is what your adversary is trying to say -- that the money that's untainted, the money that -- or the property that he bought before this crime, this untainted property becomes yours. It's not until that moment, the judgment, that the property is forfeitable. You can't forfeit it beforehand. The issue is -- Well, but -- but still the question becomes, is there a substantive difference, and I think Justice Breyer is expressing -- the problem with this, as Justice Kagan said, this intuitive sense, which is where do we draw this line? Does the right to counsel have any meaning anymore? Frankly, I expect within three to five years, if we rule in your favor, 853 will be changed to have this same language. Yes, but not pretrial.

2015,Evenwel v. Abbott,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"The problem is that -- what you're forgetting is the dual interest. There is a voting interest, but there is also a representation interest, and it's that which has led us to -- to accept the total population base because States have to have some discretion to figure out who should be having the representational voice. Burns made it very clear that we were deferring to the State because it had a legitimate reason for its need. And -- but Burns was in the 1960s, when we picked total population as a perfectly legitimate way because there's a representational need at issue as well. Not just voting. A State has to be able to say -- I think just as the Federal government did -- we're -- the legislature is protecting not just voters; it's protecting its citizens -- or noncitizens. The people who live there. What's interesting is in Reynolds is the reason they caved was because, constitutionally, the Arizona Constitution required total population. It's that fact that they deviated from their own Constitution that led them to court. So it wasn't a caving compelled by Federal law. It was mostly a casing compelled by State law. No. But what I'm saying is that we -- we acceded on the ground that using total populations was permissible. You had an expert say it, but you didn't have an expert prove it. He did not come in with a map that did that. How is -- does practical possibility play into this discussion at all? I mean, the ACS, which you posit is the way that you can find who the eligible voters are, has been -- has been -- I think almost decisively been proven as being inadequate. It only measures cities with populations or places with populations over 65,000. Just on that ground alone, there are going to be districts that can't rely on it. It's flawed on many levels. We could -- take my assumption. It's flawed. Does that practicality have any play in our decision? Do you think they did that invidiously? Did they do it purposely? They knew that, and they intentionally decided to have deviations greater than 10 percent? That's what you're saying? That goes both back to my point that they decided that they wanted to make this a representational matter. But do -- so they were precluded -- intentionally decide to exclude it? Well, we have -- we have plenty of case law that says you can have deviations greater than 10 percent -- Hawaii did -- if you have a legitimate reason. And so why would -- the great representational need that Justice Kagan was talking about not be an adequate reason? You're -- you're now -- you're now saying 10 to 20 percent is okay instead of 10 percent when we use total population. Well, how about -- How about children who are citizens when their parents are not, which is fairly common in many areas? Could you explain why the ACS -- your adversary says ACS is fine; it's used in Section 2 and Section 5. Why would it be inappropriate to use it in -- in deciding the impact on an equal voting analysis? That's not quite accurate. For -- for most States, too many, they disenfranchise prisoners, except for those who come from that locale, which is quite rational. Most States disenfranchise the mentally ill.

2015,Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Landau, there's something you said that resonates with me, because I've been trying to find a definition of ""sovereignty."" And one has been created in the briefing by saying that states are sovereign; yet if you look at international usage, they wouldn't consider states necessarily sovereign because they can't order their foreign affairs. They can't print money. They can't do lots of things that others would consider them sovereign for. So I guess the Constitution does something else with that word. What is it -- what are the elements of sovereignty with respect to the Double Jeopardy Clause that you think are commanded by our case law? There -- there's more than just the Puerto Rican people say. And it can't be that it's the compact alone. So what is it? What are the principles -- -- that you meet that would create sovereignty in the Double Jeopardy sense? Now, I'm looking at Lanza, and it says -- I think Lanza says, and it's a Double Jeopardy -- -- Clause, that for Double Jeopardy Clause purposes, sovereignty means, one, that the separate entity possesses the authority to determine what shall be an -- an offense against their peace and dignity; two, can enact laws without the interference of the other; and, three, draws authorities to punish the offender -- and this is the one that you've been arguing -- from a distinct source of power from the other sovereign. And -- and you keep saying it's the Constitution. It's the ""We the People."" It sounds a -- a bit histrionic to me. It -- there's something else. What is meant -- -- by this distinct source of power? Going back to the political issues. And -- and -- and that's what I think Justice Breyer is trying to stay away from. This is a very simple question. All right? Can the Federal government override a Puerto Rican law? Can they -- Can they veto a Puerto Rican law? All right. Who makes these laws? The laws were made by Puerto Rico's comparable Congress. But that was not true of many of the territories that were admitted as States. They came in to Statehood and were conferred by a -- the sovereignty was conferred by a -- agreement with the Federal government. And States were admitted by agreement, and sovereignty were confirmed on them by agreement. And so are you telling me that if -- let's say one of the islands in the Caribbean. I'll make one up. Okay? Atlantis has been -- never kicked out its foreign colonial status 200 years ago, but it really doesn't have many resources. And it comes to the United States and it says, I want a treaty. You'll take care of all of our external affairs. We'll follow whatever you say with respect to external affairs. We're even going to use the American dollar because it's convenient, but you can't touch our internal affairs. And Congress approves that treaty. Would that, for Double Jeopardy purposes, not be a sovereign? But if Congress has that treaty power, why does it have similar power under its Rule and Regulation Clause of the Constitution? There's no limiting principle of what rules and regulations Congress can make. Under that -- Under that constitutional clause, there's no suggestion of how or even what kinds of treaties -- perhaps not in violation of the Constitution, but what kind of treaties Congress can make. And it makes an awful large number of them. I'm sorry. You -- you're saying to me that Congress can't make Puerto Rico independent? So if it can do that, why can't it have other arrangements with Puerto Rico the way it has with everybody else? Why are we saying that with respect to territories they don't have that power? You think that doesn't have meaning? In most municipalities, their offenses are treated as criminal offenses and not criminal infractions. They can only pass laws with respect to a very limited amount of issues. The States have control over many, many other things. They are substantially different. Why would we have bothered talking about the structure of Florida's system with municipalities in Waller? We went through how the State controlled all of the -- most of the internal affairs of municipalities, and we said they are not separate sovereigns because of this control. All we could have said is what you want us to say now, which is municipalities' ultimate source is the State government. But we did something very different in that case. I'm sorry. They haven't eschewed that. In all of those cases, Grafton and all of the ones pre-1952, the Court pointed to the fact that, when these islands pass laws, they could be vetoed by Congress or -- or were -- that was the Organic Act. In all of these places, Congress was appointing their legislature, in part, or they were appointing colonial governors. And we went through, in each one of them, very carefully, what the issues of control that remained, that didn't make them sovereign in any way, that made them classic territories. So it's not that we didn't -- we eschewed looking at that. But you forget that Congress could veto those laws. Before 1952, Congress could veto Puerto Rico's laws. It has relinquished that right. Mr. Landau, would you explain what ""estado libre asociado"" means in Spanish? Literally. Do you know why they didn't use that phrase in the compact with the United States? I believe, because I've seen the Act, that they didn't because States have a different meaning in the United States. The Solicitor General's office claims that Grafton says that when we're looking at double jeopardy, we're looking at something different. We're looking at territory versus state. Do you agree with that reading of the Shell case and of Grafton? And how about Shell? ",mr landau there be something you say that resonate with me because I have be try to find a definition of sovereignty and one have be create in the briefing by say that state be sovereign yet if you look at international usage they would not consider state necessarily sovereign because they can not order their foreign affair they can not print money they can not do lot of thing that others would consider them sovereign for so i guess the constitution do something else with that word what be it what be the element of sovereignty with respect to the double jeopardy clause that you think be command by our case law there there be more than just the puerto rican people say and it can not be that it be the compact alone so what be it what be the principle that you meet that would create sovereignty in the double jeopardy sense now I be look at lanza and it say i think lanza say and it be a double jeopardy clause that for double jeopardy clause purpose sovereignty mean one that the separate entity possess the authority to determine what shall be an an offense against their peace and dignity two can enact law without the interference of the other and three draw authority to punish the offender and this be the one that you have be argue from a distinct source of power from the other sovereign and and you keep say it be the constitution it be the we the people it sound a a bit histrionic to me it there be something else what be meant by this distinct source of power go back to the political issue and and and that be what i think justice breyer be try to stay away from this be a very simple question all right can the federal government override a puerto rican law can they can they veto a puerto rican law all right who make these law the law we be make by puerto rico s comparable congress but that be not true of many of the territory that we be admit as state they come in to statehood and we be confer by a the sovereignty be confer by a agreement with the federal government and state we be admit by agreement and sovereignty we be confirm on them by agreement and so be you tell me that if let us say one of the island in the caribbean I will make one up okay atlantis have be never kick out its foreign colonial status year ago but it really do not have many resource and it come to the united state and it say i want a treaty you will take care of all of our external affair we will follow whatever you say with respect to external affair we be even go to use the american dollar because it be convenient but you can not touch our internal affair and congress approves that treaty would that for double jeopardy purpose not be a sovereign but if congress have that treaty power why do it have similar power under its rule and regulation clause of the constitution there be no limit principle of what rule and regulation congress can make under that under that constitutional clause there be no suggestion of how or even what kinds of treaty perhaps not in violation of the constitution but what kind of treaty congress can make and it make an awful large number of them I be sorry you you be say to me that congress can not make puerto rico independent so if it can do that why can not it have other arrangement with puerto rico the way it have with everybody else why be we say that with respect to territory they do not have that power you think that do not have meaning in most municipality their offense be treat as criminal offense and not criminal infraction they can only pass law with respect to a very limited amount of issue the state have control over many many other thing they be substantially different why would we have bother talk about the structure of florida s system with municipality in waller we go through how the state control all of the most of the internal affair of municipality and we say they be not separate sovereign because of this control all we could have say be what you want us to say now which be municipality ultimate source be the state government but we do something very different in that case I be sorry they have not eschew that in all of those case grafton and all of the one pre the court point to the fact that when these island pass law they could be veto by congress or or we be that be the organic act in all of these place congress be appoint their legislature in part or they we be appoint colonial governor and we go through in each one of them very carefully what the issue of control that remain that do not make them sovereign in any way that make them classic territory so it be not that we do not we eschew look at that but you forget that congress could veto those law before congress could veto puerto rico s law it have relinquish that right mr landau would you explain what estado libre asociado mean in spanish literally do you know why they do not use that phrase in the compact with the united state i believe because I have see the act that they do not because state have a different meaning in the united state the solicitor general s office claim that grafton say that when we be look at double jeopardy we be look at something different we be look at

2015,Williams v. Pennsylvania,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, am I correct that Mr. Draper, his accomplice, did not come forward until later? So he didn't know that the accomplice would say that there was a different story to tell at all, correct? And he did not know that the sexual abuse could form a very potent defense to a death penalty because there was independent proof of it. The prosecutor, in fact, told the trial judge that there wasn't any independent evidence of sexual abuse by this man of other people, correct? And in fact, the records show there was. What do you think of our jurisprudence that says you can't be judge -- you can't be a prosecutor and a judge. And so I'm -- I'm -- what does it mean to be a prosecutor, if you're not taking responsibility personally, as he claimed during the election, for the decision to execute someone, whether by policy or by individual review? And there was clearly individual review here. At -- at what point do we give meaning to the constitutional command that you can't be prosecutor and judge? I know there's so many different kinds of recusals. This is the ideal case for someone to make a due process claim, because the judge here actually signed his name to his review of the facts and his decision to seek the death penalty. What -- I mean, as I'm looking at most of the ethical codes, most of the ethical codes would have said you get off if you made this decision. Why? Do -- do you think that the public would find it unusual that someone who makes a decision as to whether to seek death penalty or not, that the public wouldn't perceive that as a great probability -- -- of actual bias? Now, I don't want to talk about -- I don't, for the moment, the history that there is some cases he disagreed with. But don't you think, as a reasonable probability, that that appearance of impropriety is just present? Mr. -- I'm sorry. Go ahead. In what sense did he concur? Did all 2,000 murders -- Did all 2,000 cases get the death penalty treatment? Were there cases where he said no to some death penalties? Were there policies he's established to establish when death penalty was appropriate? Ah, that's an interesting use of words. Somehow, someone had to make a decision of where to cut the line. I presume they looked at mitigators, too. Well, the memo required them to talk about some mitigating -- Well, this memo -- But in the other cases in which that was the case, no one knew that he was actually signing off on a review of the cases. I'm a little confused by this, and this line of argument. What is Pennsylvania? Each individual judge decides whether to recuse, right? All right. That's really wonderful. And how about if they got it wrong? Meaning -- it doesn't mean that if a whole court looks at something, it's got it right. If there's an ethical standard that says the judge who's been involved in a case shouldn't be there, then they got it wrong on their own rules. If -- if there's a constitutional standard, it doesn't mean they were right, either. They got it wrong if they let him sit. But they have to do it no matter what, meaning if -- if the State is telling them look at this, and recuse someone if it's appropriate to do so, then the State has imposed that obligation on them. Nothing about a decision in this case would require that. That's -- That's a feature unique to Pennsylvania. In many other States, including this Court, it goes up to the individual judge. ",counsel be i correct that mr draper his accomplice do not come forward until later so he do not know that the accomplice would say that there be a different story to tell at all correct and he do not know that the sexual abuse could form a very potent defense to a death penalty because there be independent proof of it the prosecutor in fact tell the trial judge that there be not any independent evidence of sexual abuse by this man of other people correct and in fact the record show there be what do you think of our jurisprudence that say you can not be judge you can not be a prosecutor and a judge and so I be I be what do it mean to be a prosecutor if you be not take responsibility personally as he claim during the election for the decision to execute someone whether by policy or by individual review and there be clearly individual review here at at what point do we give meaning to the constitutional command that you can not be prosecutor and judge i know there be so many different kind of recusal this be the ideal case for someone to make a due process claim because the judge here actually sign his name to his review of the fact and his decision to seek the death penalty what i mean as I be look at most of the ethical code most of the ethical code would have say you get off if you make this decision why do do you think that the public would find it unusual that someone who make a decision as to whether to seek death penalty or not that the public would not perceive that as a great probability of actual bias now i do not want to talk about i do not for the moment the history that there be some case he disagree with but do not you think as a reasonable probability that that appearance of impropriety be just present mr I be sorry go ahead in what sense do he concur do all murder do all case get the death penalty treatment we be there case where he say no to some death penalty we be there policy he be establish to establish when death penalty be appropriate ah that be an interesting use of word somehow someone have to make a decision of where to cut the line i presume they look at mitigators too well the memo require them to talk about some mitigating well this memo but in the other case in which that be the case no one know that he be actually sign off on a review of the case I be a little confused by this and this line of argument what be pennsylvania each individual judge decide whether to recuse right all right that be really wonderful and how about if they get it wrong mean it do not mean that if a whole court look at something it be get it right if there be an ethical standard that say the judge who be be involve in a case should not be there then they get it wrong on their own rule if if there be a constitutional standard it do not mean they we be right either they get it wrong if they let him sit but they have to do it no matter what mean if if the state be tell them look at this and recuse someone if it be appropriate to do so then the state have impose that obligation on them nothing about a decision in this case would require that that be that be a feature unique to pennsylvania in many other state include this court it go up to the individual judge ,239.63,Roberts Court,"Feb 29, 2016",Terrance Williams,Pennsylvania,15-5040,"Oct 1, 2015","Jun 9, 2016",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2015,Nebraska v. Parker,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"This tax was not imposed by the Tribe -- Tribe. This was a statute of Congress that permitted the Indians to do this, correct? Without jurisdictions, Tribes can't tax at will. They have to get approval for taxation, correct, from the Federal government? What -- what else -- what else do you lose if this ruling is against you? We've already circumscribed the powers of the Tribes on their own reservations greatly, so what powers do you lose? You've already ceded to the Federal government criminal prosecution powers. So you're not losing out on that. What are you losing out on? I'm sorry. The Tribe has acceded to State sovereignty and the environment and in all sorts of things. Have they threatened to take away the State's activities in this village? This Tribe is awfully small.

So how are they going to do all these, and why would they do all these horrible things? I mean, it's nice to have the power of taxation, but they still need the government's approval. Well, the question of the City of Sherrill says if they try to exercise their powers in a way that's harmful to settled expectations, they might have a remedy in law. That's what City of Sherrill says, but that didn't take away -- the City of Sherrill didn't say the Indians weren't sovereign. It just said they can't exercise the sovereignty.

2015,Kansas v. Carr,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Could you tell me -- -- what the constitutional standard you're asking us to apply? I -- this argument goes to harmless error; a serious position to take, that even if there was error, no foul -- a foul but no penalty. Okay? But what standard are we applying? We are not applying the rule -- or are we or should we apply the Rule 14 standard? Can you tell me why we should apply the Zafiro standard, which was joint trials, but this is joint sentencing where there is a different -- why there should be exactly the same standard applied? Do you need individualized sentencing? So can't you say, or aren't you required to say that something a little bit more than -- than the efficiency of a joint trial has to compel -- -- has to be considered? You know, if you violated an individualized sentence, why would we apply harmless error review? Meaning, it seems counterintuitive. We are now becoming the sentencing -- the sentencing body. No? Oh, so then we have to do the -- in harmless error, we have to decide whether the aggravators outweighed the mitigators, et cetera, so much that none of the error could have affected that choice? Do you think that on a retrial they cannot use the sister to prove that Reginald claimed he was the shooter? So the only issue you think was prejudicial was that he was a corruptor? The evidence. So how is that different from what the government said? Mr. McAllister, I am sorry, but even if we do this and say that the sentencings didn't need to be severed, didn't the Kansas court hold on another ground that they were entitled to a new trial? So why can't we presume it's required by the State law, not the Constitution? I mean, as I'm reading the decision below, the court is saying that the principles of the Eighth Amendment give voice to or support for the use of this burden and Kansas is commanding it. But that can't be. Already we know and the Kansas court knew the dissent pointed out that a burden for mitigating circumstances of a preponderance of the evidence is okay, so they can't believe that no burden is required by the Constitution. They know that there is no requirement because the cases mentioned by you and Justice Scalia say that. So it has to be their view of State law. What is this Court supposed to do when it's told its own lower courts three times before this case, or two, you must give this instruction? What -- what -- what's the Court supposed to do? Yes. Whether the Constitution requires it or not, it has said the better practice is to give this instruction. What's a court supposed to do? Say, willy-nilly, my lower courts can disagree with me and not do it? Didn't the Kansas Court say, yes, we have that, but the only burden of proof in any of the instructions was in aggravating circumstances and that the State bore that burden? And it pointed to the fact that aggravating and mitigating were mentioned in the same clause 5 or 6 times with no explanation of what the burden was for mitigating. The Kansas Court thought that the jurors could be confused or would be confused by what burden of proof was needed. I -- I think what they're saying is that some jurors would be confused. And certainly, there have been jury -- jury studies to indicate that jurors are often confused, generally, about burdens of proof. Well, the jury instructions don't have to be devised necessarily for the Court. They should be understandable to jurors. And I doubt very much that any juror has heard of that maxim. But putting that aside, the Kansas Court, which has much more experience than we do with trial court decisions, has determined that confusion exists or can exist. Why isn't that enough for us? Well, the prosecutor in Carr did tell the jury, I'm going to create reasonable doubt as to the defendants' mitigating evidence. So that prosecutor didn't do what you said. What a -- what a wonderful system we've created. We give -- even when a State court is wrong in convicting somebody, so long as they're reasonably wrong, we uphold them. And when they're wrong on a legal conclusion applying our test, we jump in and reverse them, right? The other States that have no mitigating burden, do you know how many of them require an instruction just like this one? Mr. Katyal, Kansas has already answered this question, hasn't it? Its requirement is that a jury be instructed both that mitigation need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and, second, that the jury be told it has no -- that there is no burden of proof. ",could you tell me what the constitutional standard you be ask us to apply i this argument go to harmless error a serious position to take that even if there be error no foul a foul but no penalty okay but what standard be we apply we be not apply the rule or be we or should we apply the rule standard can you tell me why we should apply the zafiro standard which be joint trial but this be joint sentence where there be a different why there should be exactly the same standard apply do you need individualize sentence so can not you say or be not you require to say that something a little bit more than than the efficiency of a joint trial have to compel have to be consider you know if you violate an individualized sentence why would we apply harmless error review meaning it seem counterintuitive we be now become the sentence the sentence body no oh so then we have to do the in harmless error we have to decide whether the aggravator outweigh the mitigators et cetera so much that none of the error could have affect that choice do you think that on a retrial they can not use the sister to prove that reginald claim he be the shooter so the only issue you think be prejudicial be that he be a corruptor the evidence so how be that different from what the government say mr mcallister i be sorry but even if we do this and say that the sentencings do not need to be sever do not the kansa court hold on another ground that they we be entitle to a new trial so why can not we presume it be require by the state law not the constitution i mean as I be read the decision below the court be say that the principle of the eighth amendment give voice to or support for the use of this burden and kansa be command it but that can not be already we know and the kansas court know the dissent point out that a burden for mitigate circumstance of a preponderance of the evidence be okay so they can not believe that no burden be require by the constitution they know that there be no requirement because the case mention by you and justice scalia say that so it have to be their view of state law what be this court suppose to do when it be tell its own low court three time before this case or two you must give this instruction what what what be the court suppose to do yes whether the constitution require it or not it have say the good practice be to give this instruction what be a court suppose to do say willy nilly my low court can disagree with me and not do it do not the kansas court say yes we have that but the only burden of proof in any of the instruction be in aggravate circumstance and that the state bore that burden and it point to the fact that aggravate and mitigate we be mention in the same clause or time with no explanation of what the burden be for mitigating the kansas court think that the juror could be confuse or would be confuse by what burden of proof be need i i think what they be say be that some juror would be confuse and certainly there have be jury jury study to indicate that juror be often confused generally about burden of proof well the jury instruction do not have to be devise necessarily for the court they should be understandable to juror and i doubt very much that any juror have hear of that maxim but put that aside the kansa court which have much more experience than we do with trial court decision have determine that confusion exists or can exist why be not that enough for us well the prosecutor in carr do tell the jury I be go to create reasonable doubt as to the defendant mitigate evidence so that prosecutor do not do what you say what a what a wonderful system we have create we give even when a state court be wrong in convict somebody so long as they be reasonably wrong we uphold them and when they be wrong on a legal conclusion apply our test we jump in and reverse them right the other state that have no mitigating burden do you know how many of them require an instruction just like this one mr katyal kansa have already answer this question have not it its requirement be that a jury be instruct both that mitigation need not be prove beyond a reasonable doubt and second that the jury be tell it have no that there be no burden of proof ,362.98,Roberts Court,"Oct 7, 2015",Kansas,Jonathan and Reginald Carr,14-449,"Mar 30, 2015","Jan 20, 2016",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

2015,Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Can I walk through the burden a moment? There's two types of early abortion at -- at play here. The medical abortion, that doesn't involve any hospital procedure. A doctor prescribes two pills, and the women take the pills at home, correct? I'm sorry. What? She has to come back two separate days to take them? All right. So now, from when she could take it at home, it's -- now she has to travel 200 miles or pay for a hotel to get those two days of treatment? All right. Let me ask you something about that two-day wait, okay, or -- or that travel time. How many other States and how many other recognized medical people have testified or shown that there is any benefit from taking pills at the facility as opposed to taking the pills at home, as was the case? If the Chief may permit me to finish my two-part question? The second is the D&C, the dilation and -- what's it called? Dilation and -- -- curettage. What is the risk factor for a D&C related to abortion and a non-abortion D&C? D&Cs are performed in offices for lots of other conditions besides abortion. Is there any evidence in the record that shows that there is any medical difference in the two -- in the -- in the procedures that would necessitate an abortion being in an ASC or not, or are abortions more risky than the regular D&C? So your point, I'm taking, is that the two main health reasons show that this law was targeted at abortion only? Is there any other -- I'm sorry. Is there any other medical condition by taking the pills that are required to be done in hospital, not as a prelude to a procedure in hospital, but an independent, you know -- I know there are cancer treatments by pills now. How many of those are required to be done in front of a doctor? It includes -- When there's a need. Meaning, where are you taking an account in the undue-burden analysis the value of the need being -- of being imposed? Meaning, even if I grant you that in some circumstances travel time is necessary because you just can't get any kind of abortion clinic to go into a particular area, so you might have to impose a burden that might be undue in other circumstances. Where do we evaluate the benefit of this burden? What -- what's the need? You -- you seem -- your brief seemed to be telling us that there's no role for the Court to judge whether there's really a health benefit to what you're doing. I'm not talking about the doctrine. I'm talking about the question I asked, which is, according to you, the slightest health improvement is enough to impose on hundreds of thousands of women -- even assuming I accept your argument, which I don't, necessarily, because it's being challenged -- but the slightest benefit is enough to burden the lives of a million women. That's your point? That's interesting. Well, wait a minute -- Well, do you think -- would you put -- By hospitals? Underreported -- most of the complications you're talking about were reported at hospitals, correct? Yes, there is some evidence of not reporting other things outside the hospital, but you know the number of -- hospitals are accurately reporting. Complications within their clinic? What's the percentage of 210 from 70,000? My math is pretty horrible. It's pretty small. I don't mean to -- to negate that one should try to avoid injury to anyone, and -- and don't take my question as that, but there are people who die from complications from aspirin. May be unusual, but there's a certain percentage that do that. Yet, we don't require that people take aspirins in ASC centers or in hospitals. There has to be some tie between the benefit and the burden, doesn't there? Well, don't you think that you can read that from the fact that there are so many other medical treatments whose complication rates are so disproportionately higher, and the legislature is only targeting abortion when there is nothing about the figures before it that show a risk so unusual that it needs greater attention? Can I ask: Were they opened as a result of the law, or were they planned to be opened before the law went into effect? Because I think that makes a difference to me that they were planned to be opened. It takes quite a while to dig up the money, get the investors, buy the land, do the building. It seems to me that they must have been planned for a while. And if they were, it was because there was a need independent of the number of abortions. In other words, it's fortuitous that they've come into existence, but it was in -- their need was not there -- was independent of the reduced number of facilities elsewhere. Most of them don't choose to provide abortions. So what you don't know is what -- do you have enough resources to open up an ASC if you're going to do abortions? Are you going to get enough developers to -- to invest in your work? Can I ask about McAllen? There was testimony in the record that at least four doctors had -- from that spot had asked for admitting privileges. Well, the Fifth Circuit's remedy only provided for one doctor, Dr. Lynn, who's past retirement age, to be the only doctor performing abortions in that clinic. Now, if the clinic had -- I don't know how many it had, but it had at least four people before -- it seems rather callous to say as a remedy that we're going to make that one doctor do the work of four, or maybe more doctors who didn't get admitting privileges. Why is even the Fifth Circuit's remedy reasonable? But that -- but -- if -- yes. As applied, the A -- ASC law is affecting this clinic because it can't get its doctors certified. So why does it require a named plaintiff to relieve that clinic of the obligation of going without admitting privileges? But you just lift the requirement because you know that it's the only clinic in the area. So if any doctor who's licensed appropriately can get admitting privileges, they should be permitted to work in that clinic. Why does Dr. Lynn have to become an indentured slave to ensure that women in her area are provided with their fundamental right to choose? But she wants to leave -- All right. Counsel -- But, I'm sorry -- It's valid only if it's taking care of a real problem. Well, no, no, no. A real problem, meaning, Gosnell, the governor of Pennsylvania, said was a regulatory failure. And only in that, not -- this clinic had not been inspected for 15 years. He -- the doctor was fabricating his reports. That could happen almost in any setting. Anyone who intends to break the law is going to break the law, whatever the regulatory rules are. You're going to have doctors, as happened pre our laws, who were performing abortions without permission in their offices or without licenses. And I don't want to suggest that we should presume that's going to happen, but it will happen. Well, but -- yeah, but -- but you have to see, as Justice Breyer asked you earlier, why are the problems? Isn't this a self-created problem? What happened in Texas independent of Gosnell that raised the Gosnell-like situation in Texas that made -- -- the legislature so concerned after so many years about taking care of this greater risk in abortions, as opposed to all the other procedures that are performed in non-ASC facilities? But there's complications in colonoscopies, and colonoscopies are, what, 15 times -- 28. Justice Breyer just corrected me. (Laughter.) 28 percent higher. I mean -- Why isn't that self-evident in any area that's -- This area of western Texas, it's as big as California. No? Bigger? Huge area. Why isn't it self-evident if you have a law that says you can only be an ACS provider, and who's going to come in and say, I can't be an ACS provider, but it's an undue burden on me, or it's an undue burden that's self-evident on the women in that area? Exactly. So why don't we take this lawsuit as those women saying just that? You can't have a law that has marginal, if any, medical benefit be applied to this procedure anywhere where there's an undue burden on people -- on women. Can you tell me why Planned Parenthood left the western area? The General says that Planned Parenthood -- that ASC and the -- and the admitting privileges had nothing to do with the closures in the western area of Texas. ",can i walk through the burden a moment there be two type of early abortion at at play here the medical abortion that do not involve any hospital procedure a doctor prescribes two pill and the woman take the pill at home correct I be sorry what she have to come back two separate day to take them all right so now from when she could take it at home it be now she have to travel mile or pay for a hotel to get those two day of treatment all right let me ask you something about that two day wait okay or or that travel time how many other state and how many other recognize medical people have testify or show that there be any benefit from take pill at the facility as oppose to take the pill at home as be the case if the chief may permit me to finish my two part question the second be the d c the dilation and what be it call dilation and curettage what be the risk factor for a d c relate to abortion and a non abortion d c d c be perform in office for lot of other condition besides abortion be there any evidence in the record that show that there be any medical difference in the two in the in the procedure that would necessitate an abortion be in an asc or not or be abortion more risky than the regular d c so your point I be take be that the two main health reason show that this law be target at abortion only be there any other I be sorry be there any other medical condition by take the pill that be require to be do in hospital not as a prelude to a procedure in hospital but an independent you know i know there be cancer treatment by pill now how many of those be require to be do in front of a doctor it include when there be a need meaning where be you take an account in the undue burden analysis the value of the need be of be impose meaning even if i grant you that in some circumstance travel time be necessary because you just can not get any kind of abortion clinic to go into a particular area so you might have to impose a burden that might be undue in other circumstance where do we evaluate the benefit of this burden what what be the need you you seem your brief seem to be tell us that there be no role for the court to judge whether there be really a health benefit to what you be do I be not talk about the doctrine I be talk about the question i ask which be accord to you the slight health improvement be enough to impose on hundred of thousand of woman even assume i accept your argument which i do not necessarily because it be be challenge but the slight benefit be enough to burden the life of a million woman that be your point that be interesting well wait a minute well do you think would you put by hospital underreported most of the complication you be talk about we be report at hospital correct yes there be some evidence of not report other thing outside the hospital but you know the number of hospital be accurately report complication within their clinic what be the percentage of from my math be pretty horrible it be pretty small i do not mean to to negate that one should try to avoid injury to anyone and and do not take my question as that but there be people who die from complication from aspirin may be unusual but there be a certain percentage that do that yet we do not require that people take aspirin in asc center or in hospital there have to be some tie between the benefit and the burden do not there well do not you think that you can read that from the fact that there be so many other medical treatment whose complication rate be so disproportionately high and the legislature be only target abortion when there be nothing about the figure before it that show a risk so unusual that it need great attention can i ask we be they open as a result of the law or we be they plan to be open before the law go into effect because i think that make a difference to me that they we be plan to be open it take quite a while to dig up the money get the investor buy the land do the building it seem to me that they must have be plan for a while and if they we be it be because there be a need independent of the number of abortion in other word it be fortuitous that they have come into existence but it be in their need be not there be independent of the reduced number of facility elsewhere most of them do not choose to provide abortion so what you do not know be what do you have enough resource to open up an asc if you be go to do abortion be you go to get enough developer to to invest in your work can i ask about mcallen there be testimony in the record that at least four doctor have from that spot have ask for admit privilege well the fifth circuit s remedy only provide for one doctor dr lynn who be past retirement age to be the only doctor perform abortion in that clinic now if the clinic have i do not know how many it have but it have at least four people before it seem rather callous to say as a remedy that we be go to make that one doctor do the work of four or maybe more doctor who do not get admit privilege why be even the fifth circuit s remedy reasonable but that but if yes as apply the a asc law be affect this clinic because it can not get its doctor certify so why do it require a name plaintiff to relieve that clinic of the obligation of go without admit privilege but you just lift the requirement because you know that it be the only clinic in the area so if any doctor who be license appropriately can get admitting privilege they should be permit to work in that clinic why do dr lynn have to become an indentured slave to ensure that woman in her area be provide with their fundamental right to choose but she want to leave all right counsel but I be sorry it be valid only if it be take care of a real problem well no no no a real problem meaning gosnell the governor of pennsylvania say be a regulatory failure and only in that not this clinic have not be inspect for year he the doctor be fabricate his report that could happen almost in any setting anyone who intend to break the law be go to break the law whatever the regulatory rule be you be go to have doctor as happen pre our law who we be perform abortion without permission in their office or without license and i do not want to suggest that we should presume that be go to happen but it will happen well but yeah but but you have to see as justice breyer ask you early why be the problem be not this a self create problem what happen in texas independent of gosnell that raise the gosnell like situation in texas that make the legislature so concerned after so many year about take care of this great risk in abortion as oppose to all the other procedure that be perform in non asc facility but there have complication in colonoscopy and colonoscopy be what time nan justice breyer just correct me laughter percent high i mean why be not that self evident in any area that be this area of western texas it be as big as california no big huge area why be not it self evident if you have a law that say you can only be an acs provider and who be go to come in and say i can not be an acs provider but it be an undue burden on me or it be an undue burden that be self evident on the woman in that area exactly so why do not we take this lawsuit as those woman say just that you can not have a law that have marginal if any medical benefit be apply to this procedure anywhere where there be an undue burden on people on woman can you tell me why plan parenthood leave the western area the general say that plan parenthood that asc and the and the admitting privilege have nothing to do with the closure in the western area of texas ,633.5699999999998,Roberts Court,"Mar 2, 2016","Whole Woman’s Health, et al.","John Hellerstedt, Commissioner, Texas Department of State Health Services, et

2015,Foster v. Chatman,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Bright, did the court, in your judgment, do de novo review? Didn't it say that it did -- basically, it was going to do step three of the Batson charge -- challenge? So that's a ruling on the merits. Well, it -- I think it said after -- after redoing -- Mr. Bright -- Mr. -- Mr. Bright, Mr. Lanier -- -- answered yes when he asked -- when during the -- during the trial when he was asked whether he had done -- I don't know if it -- oh, no, it was on the motion for a new trial hearing -- whether he had done the same extensive background check on all the jurors, white and black. Did you find any evidence of that extensive black background search? So -- so your -- your understanding of that statement was that all -- he had only done an extensive search on the blacks on the list? During the trial, did defense counsel, when he made his initial Batson challenge -- not in the papers, but at trial -- did he again say that this was part and parcel of the prosecutor's pattern? I was just surprised that we didn't hear about this preparation for a Batson hearing until -- -- the habeas. Mr. Bright -- -- I have found some circuit courts who have a rule on appeal or on habeas which is if they can find one legitimate reason for striking a juror -- -- that's enough to defeat a Batson challenge. Do you believe that's an appropriate rule? Are you suggesting a different approach to the question? Well, the problem is I don't think this is discretionary review. The Eleventh Circuit found it's not under Georgia law. Read its opinion. It seems pretty grounded in the stated law of Georgia. Could you give me the -- the Reed v. -- what? I'm sorry. I'm so confused I can't even -- (Laughter.) The State habeas process is different than the regular appeal process. On the regular appeal process, they look at each case -- each case with discretion. Okay. In State habeas they have a rule, an internal rule that says, we'll take every habeas case unless it's -- has no arguable merit, right? In the positive. So what would lend us to believe that they didn't look at the merits and say there was no arguable merit? That they just said, we're too busy. We don't care if there is arguable merit. Do you believe they did that? I'm sorry. What? So that is a decision on the merits. There is no arguable merits. Okay. Now it's clear. Why? Were we told that the only three people who did the investigation on Batson were the two prosecutors on the case and Mr. Lundy? So if Mr. Lundy says I didn't make that list, it has to be one of the two prosecutors. Didn't the habeas court -- -- provide an excuse and say -- I'm sorry. Didn't the habeas court accept that he didn't know at the time of trial, but he just knew that Lundy didn't want her? But that was his explanation for why the prosecutor didn't know about the prior arrest, correct? That Mr. Lundy didn't want her. That Mr. Lundy didn't want her. He never credited or never said that he knew this -- that he knew about the arrest. Mr. Lundy did, but the prosecutor didn't. What did they do with the failure to ask Ms. Garrett any questions about the issues that troubled the -- troubled, for example, her cousin's arrest. There's an assumption that she has a relationship with this cousin. I have cousins who I know have been arrested, but I have no idea where they're in jail. I hardly -- I don't know them. So -- but he didn't ask any questions. Doesn't that show pretext? I don't -- I'm not going to inquire because she might get off the hook on that. Well, stealing hubcaps, in my mind, is decidedly different than murdering people or attacking them the way this case was -- this case was about. I -- I can imagine a -- why can't you imagine a father saying, it was stealing hubcaps -- -- he should have been punished? That's what the record supports. I'm sorry. I didn't hear that. Then this Court? ",mr bright do the court in your judgment do de novo review do not it say that it do basically it be go to do step three of the batson charge challenge so that be a ruling on the merit well it i think it say after after redo mr bright mr mr bright mr lanier answer yes when he ask when during the during the trial when he be ask whether he have do i do not know if it oh no it be on the motion for a new trial hearing whether he have do the same extensive background check on all the juror white and black do you find any evidence of that extensive black background search so so your your understanding of that statement be that all he have only do an extensive search on the black on the list during the trial do defense counsel when he make his initial batson challenge not in the paper but at trial do he again say that this be part and parcel of the prosecutor s pattern i be just surprise that we do not hear about this preparation for a batson hearing until the habeas mr bright i have find some circuit court who have a rule on appeal or on habeas which be if they can find one legitimate reason for strike a juror that be enough to defeat a batson challenge do you believe that be an appropriate rule be you suggest a different approach to the question well the problem be i do not think this be discretionary review the eleventh circuit find it be not under georgia law read its opinion it seem pretty ground in the stated law of georgia could you give me the the reed v what I be sorry I be so confused i can not even laughter the state habeas process be different than the regular appeal process on the regular appeal process they look at each case each case with discretion okay in state habeas they have a rule an internal rule that say we will take every habeas case unless it be have no arguable merit right in the positive so what would lend us to believe that they do not look at the merit and say there be no arguable merit that they just say we be too busy we do not care if there be arguable merit do you believe they do that I be sorry what so that be a decision on the merit there be no arguable merit okay now it be clear why we be we tell that the only three people who do the investigation on batson we be the two prosecutor on the case and mr lundy so if mr lundy say i do not make that list it have to be one of the two prosecutor do not the habeas court provide an excuse and say I be sorry do not the habeas court accept that he do not know at the time of trial but he just know that lundy do not want her but that be his explanation for why the prosecutor do not know about the prior arrest correct that mr lundy do not want her that mr lundy do not want her he never credit or never say that he know this that he know about the arrest mr lundy do but the prosecutor do not what do they do with the failure to ask ms garrett any question about the issue that trouble the troubled for example her cousin s arrest there have an assumption that she have a relationship with this cousin i have cousin who i know have be arrest but i have no idea where they be in jail i hardly i do not know them so but he do not ask any question do not that show pretext i do not I be not go to inquire because she might get off the hook on that well steal hubcap in my mind be decidedly different than murder people or attack them the way this case be this case be about i i can imagine a why can not you imagine a father say it be steal hubcap he should have be punish that be what the record support I be sorry i do not hear that then this court ,274.57000000000005,Roberts Court,"Nov 2, 2015",Timothy Tyrone Foster,"Bruce Chatman, Warden",14-8349,"May 26, 2015","May 23, 2016",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2015,Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"The issue -- The issue that that case settled or addressed was whether exhaustion was required at all. Minimal research would have shown that every other court at that time who had addressed the issue had required exhaustion. Now, we'll go later to exhaustion-when. That's a separate question. So how could you reasonably rely on a lower court decision that hasn't gone through the crucible of appellate review without having done any research on whether its premises were subject to dispute, reasonable dispute, and rely on that? But they raised the argument just lost. They raised the argument that the exhaustion requirement didn't meet the commonality prong of class certification. So they did make an argument against it. I know that's what you believe, but every other court up until that time had said no, you needed to exhaust. Now, we can go to a separate question of exhaust-when later. But how could you at that point rely on that case to think that you didn't have to -- Actually -- -- that's not quite true. There's a circuit split which hasn't been addressed anywhere in the briefing. Some of the circuits do it the way you say. They stop the clock and restart the clock at the end of the tolled period. In those circuits you would win. You could wait the entire six years plus however long the other case was pending. But another series of circuits looked to diligence throughout the period. And so you'd be asking us to make an assumption about which -- or make a decision about which tolling applies. You are taking a risk no matter what you did. Well, let's go back to Justice -- -- Scalia's question ask you a question. All of these decisions, were they made with the advice of a lawyer? And I have a sense that the Tribe was concerned about its resources and that they were just getting together and talking about this and deciding, we're not going to win under the law, so we're not going to file. And it was only when Cherokee Nation was decided by this Court that they realized they had a viable claim. So -- but answer my question: Was there legal advice sought? If we disagree that that was -- if we think that was unreasonable, what -- your reading of what class counsel said, what would happen? But wait. I just want to clarify one point. On this issue of -- that you were a member of the class, you rely just on counsel's letter in the first case, in Ramah, the letter that -- where counsel described the class and said there would be -- No, in the prior case. Yes. No, no, no, no, no. You said that the lawyers had told you that there would be class action tolling. That was the general -- Yes. But you haven't answered my question. That's the only advice from a lawyer you received. How did it know that, in Cherokee Nation? He claims that the only decision was on -- under Rule 23, and that presentment and tolling was not at issue there. Well, let's talk about the American Pipe tolling. It would seem to me, as has happened in a number of litigations, that at the time that the complaint is filed, it doesn't mean that every member of the class has to have exhausted, because if that's what it means, then there can never be a class action. All right. So that issue is still open under the law, because it would seem to me, and I could be wrong, that if you still have time on the clock when the complaint is filed, that you can -- before you receive any remedy under the class action suit, you can present -- exhaust then, and recover, if you've done it during the period that -- the six-year period plus tolling. That's what some courts have done. They've defined the class as people who have exhausted, or who still have time to exhaust. Well, this is a slightly different argument. You're saying they can't get equitably tolled for exhaustion of the administrative process. Even if they could get tolled for filing a lawsuit. That it's settled in all 13 circuits. They've all ruled one way. You don't think it's reasonable to give advice based on that ruling, that that might be an exceptional circumstance? So how about it's not 13, it's 12, but you're in a circuit that hasn't ruled. You mean that it's -- it wouldn't be an extraordinary circumstance in that situation? That's one circuit. I'm talking about the vast majority. 12 out of 13. Fair. Fair answer. There -- there are so many people who don't have resources to pursue a litigation. How do we differentiate you from those millions of people with lack of resources who choose not to pursue claims, either because they think, at least up till then, they're going to lose, because that's the state of the law, or for whatever other reason they're waiting? How -- how do we -- how do we articulate an equitable tolling principle that won't open a floodgate to making a statute of limitations basically a nullity? If it was reasonable, why didn't you litigate that? Why didn't you take the order of the -- the court below, that -- and appeal that order? To seek cert. on that question? When there was no split. But you had a split. When your decision came up. ",the issue the issue that that case settle or address be whether exhaustion be require at all minimal research would have show that every other court at that time who have address the issue have require exhaustion now we will go later to exhaustion when that be a separate question so how could you reasonably rely on a low court decision that have not go through the crucible of appellate review without have do any research on whether its premise we be subject to dispute reasonable dispute and rely on that but they raise the argument just lose they raise the argument that the exhaustion requirement do not meet the commonality prong of class certification so they do make an argument against it i know that be what you believe but every other court up until that time have say no you need to exhaust now we can go to a separate question of exhaust when later but how could you at that point rely on that case to think that you do not have to actually that be not quite true there have a circuit split which have not be address anywhere in the briefing some of the circuit do it the way you say they stop the clock and restart the clock at the end of the tolled period in those circuit you would win you could wait the entire six year plus however long the other case be pending but another series of circuit look to diligence throughout the period and so you would be ask us to make an assumption about which or make a decision about which toll applies you be take a risk no matter what you do well let us go back to justice scalia s question ask you a question all of these decision we be they make with the advice of a lawyer and i have a sense that the tribe be concern about its resource and that they we be just get together and talk about this and decide we be not go to win under the law so we be not go to file and it be only when cherokee nation be decide by this court that they realize they have a viable claim so but answer my question be there legal advice seek if we disagree that that be if we think that be unreasonable what your reading of what class counsel say what would happen but wait i just want to clarify one point on this issue of that you we be a member of the class you rely just on counsel s letter in the first case in ramah the letter that where counsel describe the class and say there would be no in the prior case yes no no no no no you say that the lawyer have tell you that there would be class action tolling that be the general yes but you have not answer my question that be the only advice from a lawyer you receive how do it know that in cherokee nation he claim that the only decision be on under rule and that presentment and tolling be not at issue there well let us talk about the american pipe tolling it would seem to me as have happen in a number of litigation that at the time that the complaint be file it do not mean that every member of the class have to have exhaust because if that be what it mean then there can never be a class action all right so that issue be still open under the law because it would seem to me and i could be wrong that if you still have time on the clock when the complaint be file that you can before you receive any remedy under the class action suit you can present exhaust then and recover if you have do it during the period that the six year period plus toll that be what some court have do they have define the class as people who have exhaust or who still have time to exhaust well this be a slightly different argument you be say they can not get equitably toll for exhaustion of the administrative process even if they could get toll for file a lawsuit that it be settle in all circuit they have all rule one way you do not think it be reasonable to give advice base on that ruling that that might be an exceptional circumstance so how about it be not it have but you be in a circuit that have not rule you mean that it be it would not be an extraordinary circumstance in that situation that be one circuit I be talk about the vast majority out of fair fair answer there there be so many people who do not have resource to pursue a litigation how do we differentiate you from those million of people with lack of resource who choose not to pursue claim either because they think at least up till then they be go to lose because that be the state of the law or for whatever other reason they be wait how how do we how do we articulate an equitable tolling principle that will not open a floodgate to make a statute of limitation basically a nullity if it be reasonable why do not you litigate that why do not you take the order of the the court below that and appeal that order to seek cert on that question when there be no split but you have a split when your decision come up ,387.65,Roberts Court,"Dec 1, 2015",Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin,"United States, et al.",14-510,"Jun 30, 2015","Jan 25, 2016",113.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2015,Sheriff v. Gillie,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"What other -- what other position does the State call someone an independent contractor but we treat them as an officer nevertheless or an employee of someone? We may do it for tax purposes, but we then look at a series of factors to determine whether they're really employees or not. It's hard for you to argue these are employees; correct? They're totally without supervision in their actual debt collection; correct? Okay. But you're not claiming they're employees? So what other situation have we ever, in any setting, treated someone whom is called an independent contractor, an officer of a company, government agency, anything? This is a novel sort of idea -- That you as the state say this is an independent contractor, and now, by law, we're going to deem them an officer. Well, the problem I have is, I certainly understand officers -- like, with corporations. With corporations, officers are defined by their charter of incorporation. These are the officers; these are their responsibilities. It may set an income scale of some sort or tell you which agency within the corporation is going to determine that. And you have officers of State agencies that are defined by law. But I don't know that I've ever seen an officer defined by a contract. I -- I thought that that was just for tax collection. This is not a tax collection case, is it? I know the attorney general has read it as giving him more power than what it says on its face, but putting that aside, this is not a tax collection. This is a student debt collection, a consumer debt; correct? So what does your contract require them to comply with the Act? Are the remedies against the State? No, I'm just talking practical question. Are you indemnifying? You're not indemnifying. They are contractually bound to follow the Act. And you're, instead, trying to give them immunity for their acts, even though they may have breached. We can get to that second question in a moment. Let's assume they breached the Act. Just an assumption. Don't go crazy. (Laughter.) You want to give them immunity for their contractual violation. They're State officers. So what other laws? Is there any case that you can point me to where they've been charged with a 1983 violation that you've indemnified them? Could you tell me what the definition is of ""officer."" Give me the definition. What's your definition? Your definition seems to be tailored to this category. But tell me how -- what your general definition is. Does the law not authorize you to hire special -- So how is this different from that? Basically, this argument, as I understand it -- maybe you can correct me -- is that even a private collector could use the name of Filene's Basement because it's not misleading. It's telling the person, assuming they say, ""I have been hired by Filene's Basement to collect your debt on Filene's Basement's letterhead and sign it ""debt collector X, Y, and Z."" Under this argument, that would be okay because it's not misleading? Well, the questions have been asked of you. That would be the import. And if I understand you correctly, you're saying we make a different judgment than Congress is about the relative weight of how misleading this is, but Congress made this judgment? But under your position, the -- the attorney general of the State of Ohio is in violation of the law. That's the position of the United States that you're arguing in this court? How do they know who to call? Does the Act say that the special debt collector has to give them the AG's problem-solving -- But that's quite interesting, because the only number that's in these letters is the net -- number of the debt collector. Is there any obligation in the contract for the debt collector, when he receives a customer complaint, to give them the number of the AG's customer service -- That's fine. But as far as I see it, isn't there one of these two cases where someone who wasn't the special counsel signed the letter?

2015,Bruce v. Samuels,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"In terms of one of your purposes, why isn't the government's concession that in no circumstance can a fee 20 percent be taken until -- unless it's above $10? Why doesn't that take care of your problem? No, what the government -- I understand -- and they'll correct me -- is I think they are saying that if you pay a -- the initial filing fee, and you're down to $8, they can't take another 10 -- another 20 percent. That's how I understood their concession. If you're at 55, you take 10. Actually, I -- I didn't realize the back end of this. Forget about the prisoner. I'm thinking about the courts. Basically, you're saying the last court that brings him over 10 -- the moment he has over $10, the court who gives -- no. That doesn't happen. The court -- he pays a filing fee. He now has more than $10 in the account. That court gets more money than the other courts? But does all of this by all of the States, all of the prisons? Because your adversary says that some are going below the $10. Be clear about your policy. And I think your adversary agrees. Under (a), the 20 percent has to be paid on all five cases whether the amount is above 10 or -- the amount in the account is above 10 or below 10, correct? So those five cases would always wipe out the $10. So -- and so the $10 floor starts once the account goes up -- you have to -- a bottom. You have always $10 in your account, but any dollar that goes into your account after that, 20 percent has to be paid. But you would take 20 percent. Let's say there's $10 and -- there's $11. The one extra dollar is paid to whom? Let's assume there's five cases there. Would take that entire $1?

2015,Fisher v. University of Texas,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Assume need was proven. I know. You're -- you're -- you're -- we're putting aside need. What's wrong with this plan if need is put aside? No, no, no, no. I know you're saying they don't need to do it. I said put it aside and answer Justice Ginsburg's question. If they had to use race, how are they using it improperly? My God, that sounds like it's using race more rather than less than this plan does. How does that -- You still haven't answered why this is worse than Bakke. I mean -- How is race given -- How is race given a plus? I -- I thought that what they're looking for is leaders in diversity, not just of race, but of experiences generally. So how -- I think your brief admitted that this isn't in favor of any particular race, that white people in some situations can show leadership, as -- as well as black or Hispanic or Asian or Native American. Any race could benefit from this plus factor. So how is this -- -- worse than Bakke? I'm sorry. I thought that the study they did showed that in 1996, they had more participation in these smaller classes. I don't know if they're really small when they're somewhere between eight and 25 people. That was a -- but there were more of those classes in 1996 than in 2003 or '2 when they were looking at that study. It would seem to me that that suggests that there's less -- what they took from it, that there's less exchange of ideas in a classroom rather than more, based on this race-neutral policy. What's wrong -- since you have to infer these things, you can't use a quota. You're saying we can't -- they can't use demographics. So they use a study that shows there's less classes. There's less people in classes. They talk to administrators, faculty, and students. They're having racial incidents on campus where students of color are complaining that they feel isolated, that stereotyping is going on, on campus. What more do they need? Could I -- May I ask -- I'm sorry. I thought you said -- I'm sorry. I'm not sure where you get that number. As I look at it, between 2004 and 2006 -- '7, it nearly doubled from 3.6 of the holistic class to 6.8. For Hispanic students -- that's for blacks -- it went from 11.6 to 16.9. I don't think that's -- that small a change. In 2008, two -- 20 percent of all black students and 15 percent of all Hispanic students were offered admission through holistic review. Black and Hispanic admission and enrollment rates have increased since 2005. This is on -- on holistic review. The only exception was 2008, and that was because 92 percent of the class came in under the 10 percent plan. When your number -- -- that's not small. Well, wait a minute. I don't understand how that can be. If the 2004 number was that much lower than the 2007 number, race has to have some input in that fact -- in that -- Could I ask you a different question now? I fear something. I know there is an educational debate on the benefits and costs of a 10 percent plan. I don't want to get into that debate, but I do have a worry, which is: If you're reading proof of a compelling need, or proof of a compelling need, will any holistic review ever survive? Because as I'm reading your answer, to narrowly tailor, schools have to use nonracial means of doing it. And if the 10 percent plan is the only thing that achieves a greater number in minorities, won't every school have to use a 10 percent plan? So your answer is yes. If there's no other -- -- way of doing it, then the only other race-neutral way -- if offering scholarships, which this university did, increasing outreach to minority neighborhoods, they did and continue to do -- there's a list of about six or eight other things they did that didn't increase the admission of minorities. One of the -- Let me -- Mr. Garre, this is the fundamental problem that I think Justice Alito is pointing to, and you're sort of talking past each other. So maybe I'll explain his view. (Laughter.) Strange, isn't that? I think I'll explain what his view is. He seems to think that you didn't study the 10 percent admittees enough before -- to make -- to see whether that group was diverse in and of itself, whether you had enough people within that group that were change agents, that were -- had -- were not just poor people, but people with college-educated parents, whatever other diverse view factors. He's -- I think he's saying, you didn't look to see if the 10 percent plan did enough for you. And with deficits that plan created, that you should have filled in the holistic-looking. So he thinks it's fatally flawed. All right? Because of that. So that's his view, I think. So assuming that view, what's your answer? I know. He said it wasn't, right? That was with the ten -- so seven years -- Race-blind -- -- and a certain number of them were with the 10 percent -- Do you think -- do you think that change has to happen overnight? And do you think it's -- I -- I -- I -- what you're saying, basically, is, is this is what the Fifth Circuit concluded and which the school basically agrees, okay? If you don't consider race, then holistic percentage, whatever it is, is going to be virtually all white. All white. And to say -- no -- Oh, but there is -- No, it's not -- It's not, because the reality -- -- that Justice -- -- Alito wants to rely on. Let me finish my point. He's right. For their educational needs, there are competing criteria. They need to keep a certain SAT, or whatever that's called, AI index, that has to be high because of the quality they want to keep the school at. That does discriminate against blacks on some levels, because the difference in numbers are high. So if you have something like this, you're -- what you're saying, basically, is, and what he's proposing, is change your educational needs across the board, and focus in only on race, and make sure that your school is black, Hispanic, or whatever on numbers that are going to reduce its educational quality. That's basically what you're arguing, isn't it? Why? What we know is -- -- the school doesn't have enough -- -- no matter what it does, it doesn't have enough numbers of black people.

2015,Mathis v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"So Mr. Fleming -- Why don't we use this case? All right -- at the Joint Appendix it says -- one of the charging elements says that Richard Allen Mathis, on such-and-such a date in Iowa, unlawfully and willfully break -- I'm sorry about the tenses -- broke and entered a storage shed belonging to -- to the victim with the intention to commit a theft. If I read that, do I know what's an element or a means? It is very clear that the only thing being charged is breaking into a shed. Well, I mean, this doesn't say willfully -- willfully -- unlawfully and willfully. Do I have to go further, and why, meaning, isn't the issue here what we left off -- open in Descamps? Iowa calls this a means, but if I read the instrument, it seems like an element. So what does a judge do? Give me the steps of interpretive principles that a judge would do with a case like this. The State law dispositive, that's number -- first, let's start there. So that's your entire case, correct? Let's assume Iowa was silent. That was the question that Justice Breyer -- -- was coming to. If I look at this, it seems -- it doesn't say, enter a storage area or a structure as a -- a structure or a boat. It says just enter a storage shed. Yes, the problem -- -- with Descamps there is that ""feloniously entered"" had two potential meanings: You broke and you entered, or you remained unlawfully and committed a crime. And what we said in Descamps was, reading felonious entry, you don't know which of the two it is because it -- it's not an element. You just have to do one or -- it's not an element. It's a means. We didn't know which one, but this is sort of different. This is the indictment saying the structure you broke into is this particular one. Do you see a difference between -- he had to do one or the other here. He had to break into a house or break into a vehicle. But in Descamps, he could have done one of two things. He could have broken and entered, or he could have stayed unlawfully. Exactly. He wasn't pleading guilty to one or the other. He way saying, I did unlawfully what the indictment said, feloniously entered. But I -- he did not have to and did not admit exactly which of the two ways he did it. Go back to my ultimate question. Tell me the steps. You say State law is dispositive. Assume State law is unclear. Applying your approach now, how does Descamps come out? How does Descamps come out? That -- that's stretching things. I think 99 percent of the courts across the country would have looked at the plea agreement and said, the prosecutor said he broke and entered a garage. We're going to find he broke and entered a garage. And he didn't stay a -- I'm sorry, a grocery store -- and he didn't stay unlawfully. So how do we get courts, assuming we accept your argument, not to do the kind of inferential retrying of the case -- -- that often happens when you're relying on Shepard documents? I'm sorry. Tell me what your approach is that you think is our approach?

2015,"Universal Health Services, Inc. v. Escobar",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"All right. I'm sorry. I'm totally confused. I always thought that when you asked for payment, you're making a promise: I did what I agreed to do. Pay me, please. That's, to me, what's sort of understood. If I hired you to provide me with doctor services, you ask me for money, I'm assuming you provided me with doctor services. And you know you didn't. Why isn't that a fraud? So providing a gun that doesn't shoot to the Army is simply a contract breach? What -- what more facts do you need? Government contracted for guns. All of a sudden you deliver guns that don't shoot. That -- those are the facts that led to this Act. Do you think that anybody, except yourself, would ever think that it wasn't a fraud to provide guns that don't shoot if that's what the -- the government contracted for? Whether -- -- they made it -- If we don't -- Mr. Frederick -- -- this confuses me to no end. I don't know why the lower court relied on the Section 423, this -- the director's qualifications and responsibilities when there's a direct regulation that says that the health service will only pay for services rendered by a staff member who's qualified. Why did they go off on this indirect method of analyzing this case? But there's a regulation right on point. Well, but that doesn't answer the question. There's a miscoding that's intentional and knowing, and there's a miscoding that's negligent. So if it's a mistake, you could withhold payment, but you can't sue under the False Claims Act, correct? Let's not forget something. Money came from the Federal government. It may be a system in this cooperative program that's flawed, but Massachusetts Health has no incentive to seek the money back because they're not paying it. The people with the incentive are the Federal government, and that's why we have the False Claims Act, because the Federal government can't enforce all seeking of money back in these cooperative programs. I have a very hard time accepting that if you provide -- if you claim money for a service that you don't render, not a qualified individual, unsupervised by a qualified individual, which is a requirement specifically in the regulations, I'm having a hard time understanding how you have not committed a fraud -- -- if you knew what you were doing.

2015,Voisine v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I'm sorry. Intentionality, in my mind, is misperceived, because you think -- you're talking about intentionality as the act of causing the injury. But I understood common-law battery to be the intentional act that causes the injury; i.e., if a husband threw a bottle at a wife, doesn't intend to hit her, but the bottle smashes against the wall and the glass embeds itself in her face, under the common law that would have been a battery because the act, the intentional act, was to throw the bottle. It wasn't -- it wasn't to cause the injury, but the act caused the injury. I know. If we end up disagreeing because the government points to many examples where this is the case, how do you win? But -- but the point is that the contact was in -- was -- some contact had to have occurred. The question is whether there was an act that caused that contact regardless of whether it was intentional or reckless. Well, we were talking about common-law battery as it applied to -- definition as it applied in a domestic setting. So I'm talking only about a domestic setting -- -- which this is. Don't you have to look at this in the domestic violence context? Because the definition, ""use of force"" as put in terms of a misdemeanor under Federal or State triable law, means -- so it means a domestic violence. And isn't it prototypical in many of these domestic violence cases where much of the violence employed is not direct violence, not hitting some -- there's a lot of that, but there's an awful lot of the examples I raised of reckless conduct that leads to violence, either from drunkenness or from other conditions. You're using ""use of force"" as it's being defined in other areas. Why does it fit into this domestic violence case? That's the offensive touching prong. That has nothing -- That was the offensive touching prong. I'm talking about, here, the use of physical force prong -- -- that causes injury in some way. Can you please go back to the question Justice Kagan asked you and not using the shaking somebody, because I don't understand how shaking someone doesn't constitute the use of physical force. It may not be great force, but it's -- it's touching. What other example do you have of a reckless act that wouldn't involve the use of physical force? You're -- you're sort of saying -- -- it has to be intentionally offensive. -- as opposed to -- It always involves, however, the touching. And the use of force to constitute the touching. So what difference does it make whether it's intentional or reckless -- -- in terms of the culpability involved? But the -- -- use of force -- and -- and we're giving examples that are not domestic violence examples, but that has caused a sufficiently offensive touching to constitute a crime. So that's going to be prosecuted. ",I be sorry intentionality in my mind be misperceive because you think you be talk about intentionality as the act of cause the injury but i understood common law battery to be the intentional act that cause the injury ie if a husband throw a bottle at a wife do not intend to hit her but the bottle smash against the wall and the glass embed itself in her face under the common law that would have be a battery because the act the intentional act be to throw the bottle it be not it be not to because the injury but the act cause the injury i know if we end up disagreeing because the government point to many example where this be the case how do you win but but the point be that the contact be in be some contact have to have occur the question be whether there be an act that cause that contact regardless of whether it be intentional or reckless well we we be talk about common law battery as it apply to definition as it apply in a domestic setting so I be talk only about a domestic setting which this be do not you have to look at this in the domestic violence context because the definition use of force as put in term of a misdemeanor under federal or state triable law mean so it mean a domestic violence and be not it prototypical in many of these domestic violence case where much of the violence employ be not direct violence not hit some there be a lot of that but there be an awful lot of the example i raise of reckless conduct that lead to violence either from drunkenness or from other condition you be use use of force as it be be define in other area why do it fit into this domestic violence case that be the offensive touching prong that have nothing that be the offensive touching prong I be talk about here the use of physical force prong that cause injury in some way can you please go back to the question justice kagan ask you and not use the shaking somebody because i do not understand how shake someone do not constitute the use of physical force it may not be great force but it be it be touch what other example do you have of a reckless act that would not involve the use of physical force you be you be sort of say it have to be intentionally offensive as oppose to it always involve however the touching and the use of force to constitute the touching so what difference do it make whether it be intentional or reckless in term of the culpability involve but the use of force and and we be give example that be not domestic violence example but that have cause a sufficiently offensive touch to constitute a crime so that be go to be prosecute ,208.71000000000004,Roberts Court,"Feb 29, 2016","Stephen Voisine, et al.",United States,14-10154,"Oct 30, 2015","Jun 27, 2016",113.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2015,"Federal Energy Regulatory Commission v.

It is the people buying from the wholesalers, which are a different entity from the retailers, who are doing it. Where is that -- Where is that in -- written anywhere that that was their goal? That's how you've characterized that goal. But what I've heard them say is, we're trying to lower the price of wholesale to a more just amount. That's what's in anything I've seen written. You've recharacterized it. But in the retail market. They're -- they're generators selling to intermediaries. The intermediaries are the ones who are in the market with the retailers. So what's the horror here of concurrent jurisdiction? You seem to posit that this is horrible, but if, in fact, it's lowering prices, Wal-Mart sees it as a lowering of prices, I -- hard to think of why States would say no, but some of them have. But I'm not sure what the problem is with concurrent jurisdiction. But they all -- each of them affect each other. Well, wait a minute. That's the classic choice that we give agencies. They had expert testimony, Dr. Khan, who was undisputed to be a leading expert in this field, say the opposite. I mean, how do we choose to go into the weeds of something as technical as that? That's been entrusted to the agency. Would you tell me which one? I mean, I looked through everything that the dissenter said, and there is at least one or two or three paragraphs in the FEC's report on this that directly explains why they chose a different route. The -- the court below didn't give us one comment by the dissenter that wasn't addressed by something said in the report. And they -- and they recognized that, and what did they say?

2015,Dietz v. Bouldin,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Am I -- are you confirming that you're not raising a constitutional barrier to the recall of jurors? All right. But not -- not directly. In most fair trial analyses, we look to prejudice. You don't get a fair trial unless there is a likelihood of prejudice. So why is it that we would make an absolute rule barring the recall of the jury, except in the circumstance you're conceding? Why don't we go back to what the Chief Justice said? Why aren't we looking for more specific prejudice? Well, there's no statutory bar. Well, we don't have a specific rule that permits district courts to rescind any order they've issued. But we've routinely, through history, permitted district courts, when they think they've entered an erroneous order, to just rescind it. Why isn't this one of those orders? But those are statutorily barred from happening. Mr. Katyal, my problem is I have problems with his rules; I have problems with yours. (Laughter.) So you've got to -- and -- and I think it's some of what the government is saying. Putting aside the questioning here, which troubles me in its adequacy, okay, it's not uncommon -- it was perhaps uncommon in this case for families to be crying outside of courtrooms, for families to be talking to each other and visibly expressing either their pleasure or displeasure at what a jury did. Not uncommon for court correction officers in the State of New York to get very close to juries -- when they used to sequester them, but even today -- and a corrections officer saying something like, good job, guys, at the end of the verdict, okay, when the jury's discharged. There is expressions in the courtroom. If we do a prejudice test, how are we going to ensure that that concept of a fair trial is wholesome enough to not permit what I consider some -- could be potentially great contamination of the jury and of their emotional state? I mean, there are juries all of the time who have the night to think about a case who change their mind. And the next day, they're reaching out to the court or they're reaching out to one of the party's attorneys and wanting to undo the verdict. But what's the rule that takes care of all of those things? Is -- is it the boundless ability to recall juries? What are the circumstances a court should look at? What's your rule? Give me a rule that -- I know, but you're making that up. And it doesn't take care of the things I talked about. Well, it depends on the courthouse. In most courthouses, certainly the Federal system and a lot of State systems, the jury doesn't get to go out and mix with the public. Do you think -- -- but you're not -- Suppose we tell -- I mean, look at the totality of the circumstances is a great test, but it doesn't give much guidance to courts below. Tell me what the guidance is that we give. I'm thinking of something like, if they've been exposed to any extraneous reactions, words, information, conversation -- I can go on with a list of verbs -- but you can't recall it? Are there any limits to this power? It's certainly not going to help courts if we adopt a Federal rule. I'm looking for a principle that would apply for where this problem occurs the most often, which is State court. So tell me how we rule in a way that, because this is what I mentioned before, how many jurors change their mind? So why can't we recall a jury six months later? Just this case. I mean, they didn't talk about it afterwards. It's not an earth shattering case. Why can't we call them back the next day, the day after, just ask them did you talk to anybody? They say no. Then you go back and resubmit the case now. Why? Give me the limiting prejudice. What prejudice? You haven't shown any prejudice. They didn't with anybody about the case. They didn't -- I'm talking about one to infinity, because if -- presumably I'm interested in some limits to this. ",be i be you confirm that you be not raise a constitutional barrier to the recall of juror all right but not not directly in most fair trial analysis we look to prejudice you do not get a fair trial unless there be a likelihood of prejudice so why be it that we would make an absolute rule bar the recall of the jury except in the circumstance you be concede why do not we go back to what the chief justice say why be not we look for more specific prejudice well there be no statutory bar well we do not have a specific rule that permit district court to rescind any order they have issue but we have routinely through history permit district court when they think they have enter an erroneous order to just rescind it why be not this one of those order but those be statutorily bar from happen mr katyal my problem be i have problem with his rule i have problem with yours laughter so you have get to and and i think it be some of what the government be say put aside the questioning here which trouble me in its adequacy okay it be not uncommon it be perhaps uncommon in this case for family to be cry outside of courtroom for family to be talk to each other and visibly express either their pleasure or displeasure at what a jury do not uncommon for court correction officer in the state of new york to get very close to jury when they use to sequester them but even today and a correction officer say something like good job guy at the end of the verdict okay when the jury s discharge there be expression in the courtroom if we do a prejudice test how be we go to ensure that that concept of a fair trial be wholesome enough to not permit what i consider some could be potentially great contamination of the jury and of their emotional state i mean there be jury all of the time who have the night to think about a case who change their mind and the next day they be reach out to the court or they be reach out to one of the party s attorney and want to undo the verdict but what be the rule that take care of all of those thing be be it the boundless ability to recall jury what be the circumstance a court should look at what be your rule give me a rule that i know but you be make that up and it do not take care of the thing i talk about well it depend on the courthouse in most courthouse certainly the federal system and a lot of state system the jury do not get to go out and mix with the public do you think but you be not suppose we tell i mean look at the totality of the circumstance be a great test but it do not give much guidance to court below tell me what the guidance be that we give I be think of something like if they have be expose to any extraneous reaction word information conversation i can go on with a list of verb but you can not recall it be there any limit to this power it be certainly not go to help court if we adopt a federal rule I be look for a principle that would apply for where this problem occur the most often which be state court so tell me how we rule in a way that because this be what i mention before how many juror change their mind so why can not we recall a jury six month later just this case i mean they do not talk about it afterwards it be not an earth shatter case why can not we call them back the next day the day after just ask them do you talk to anybody they say no then you go back and resubmit the case now why give me the limit prejudice what prejudice you have not show any prejudice they do not with anybody about the case they do not I be talk about one to infinity because if presumably I be interested in some limit to this ,297.21,Roberts Court,"Apr 26, 2016",Rocky Dietz,Hillary Bouldin,15-458,"Jan 19, 2016","Jun 9, 2016",113.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2015,Sturgeon v. Frost,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"So you're claiming a right not merely to use the hovercraft in the nonpublic lands. You're claiming that there's no residual right to control navigable waters in the Federal lands area? So what do you do about the ANILCA provision that says that boating and other water activities within public lands, within Federal public lands can be regulated? That's not what it says. It says any waters in the jurisdiction of the United States. Well, it could apply to both, is what I'm saying. What says it excludes navigable waters? Your reading on a practical basis with respect to the navigable waters makes almost no sense to me. I'm looking at a map attached to the petition of the State of Alaska. It's attached to the end of the brief. And it seems like these national parks are spread along the coast of Alaska in a haphazard way, meaning the national parks have jurisdiction over a small strip along the coast of Alaska. Presumably you're not arguing that this agreement controls the U.S. servitude of navigable waters around those strips. So you're saying that the U.S. can't control the navigable servitude in any part of that coast. Can. And so what do you take the words in -- in 103(c) to mean, the boating exception, when it says ""in the jurisdiction of the United States""? ""Waters in the jurisdiction""? You don't think navigable waters are within the jurisdiction of the United States in Federal lands? Repeat what you said. I didn't quite hear it or understand it. I'm sorry. Say it again. So you're not -- I'm sorry. You're not saying that the Coast Guard couldn't come in and say no hovercrafts around the Alaskan coast. How about if they wanted to say, in this alcove, the Coast Guard, not the Park Service, says you can't have hovercrafts, that would be okay? It's wrong. And -- and -- and walk it through, their argument, and tell me why they are wrong. I think they start with that Federal lands, as defined under the statute, are only lands that the U.S. has title to. Do you take -- do you disagree with that? And if so, why? How? Read the statute -- -- and -- and -- and tell me how -- -- in the statute -- -- you can read it more broadly. I'm going -- I'm in the definition section. I'm with you so far. That gets you to regulating the waters in Federal -- in -- in -- in Federal units, because the U.S. under ANILCA only controls lands within the conservation units that are public lands. In the United States. So -- and does the no-hovercraft rule apply to the nonpublic lands? Is that the position you're taking, that you have the right to regulate that as well? Why? You're -- you're conceding that the waters are outside of that? Can you tell me whether that statute violates this statute? Some might argue that your proposed regulations on oil contravene the intent of this provision. So assuming we do, how do you deal with that? Assuming some people do. I don't -- I don't know that -- Well, the specific would overcome the general. So if Congress passed a new statute, it could limit or expand 103 as it chose, correct? No. That's you winning. (Laughter.) I think Justice Alito has been asking you this question from the beginning. What do you think the Ninth Circuit meant? And do you agree with its interpretation? As he pointed out -- -- you spent 49 pages of your brief arguing other things -- -- putting you to the test. All right. So what do you think it held? Do you think the Ninth Circuit was right? ",so you be claim a right not merely to use the hovercraft in the nonpublic land you be claim that there be no residual right to control navigable water in the federal land area so what do you do about the anilca provision that say that boat and other water activity within public land within federal public land can be regulate that be not what it say it say any water in the jurisdiction of the united state well it could apply to both be what I be say what say it exclude navigable water your reading on a practical basis with respect to the navigable water make almost no sense to me I be look at a map attach to the petition of the state of alaska it be attach to the end of the brief and it seem like these national park be spread along the coast of alaska in a haphazard way mean the national park have jurisdiction over a small strip along the coast of alaska presumably you be not argue that this agreement control the us servitude of navigable water around those strip so you be say that the us can not control the navigable servitude in any part of that coast can and so what do you take the word in in c to mean the boating exception when it say in the jurisdiction of the united state water in the jurisdiction you do not think navigable water be within the jurisdiction of the united state in federal land repeat what you say i do not quite hear it or understand it I be sorry say it again so you be not I be sorry you be not say that the coast guard could not come in and say no hovercraft around the alaskan coast how about if they want to say in this alcove the coast guard not the park service say you can not have hovercraft that would be okay it be wrong and and and walk it through their argument and tell me why they be wrong i think they start with that federal land as define under the statute be only land that the us have title to do you take do you disagree with that and if so why how read the statute and and and tell me how in the statute you can read it more broadly I be go I be in the definition section I be with you so far that get you to regulate the water in federal in in in federal unit because the us under anilca only control land within the conservation unit that be public land in the united state so and do the no hovercraft rule apply to the nonpublic land be that the position you be take that you have the right to regulate that as well why you be you be concede that the water be outside of that can you tell me whether that statute violate this statute some might argue that your propose regulation on oil contravene the intent of this provision so assume we do how do you deal with that assume some people do i do not i do not know that well the specific would overcome the general so if congress pass a new statute it could limit or expand as it choose correct no that be you win laughter i think justice alito have be ask you this question from the beginning what do you think the ninth circuit meant and do you agree with its interpretation as he point out you spend page of your brief argue other thing put you to the test all right so what do you think it hold do you think the ninth circuit be right ,271.63000000000005,Roberts Court,"Jan 20, 2016",John Sturgeon,Bert Frost,14-1209,"Oct 1, 2015","Mar 22, 2016",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

You're a class of people because I say you can't be covered by this. It doesn't make much sense in terms -- can't be covered by this law. What's -- isn't there a simpler way of arguing this, which is that if -- and your co-counsel is -- Petitioner's counsel is suggesting it. If you can be retried under the existing law with a corrective process, that's procedural. If you can't be retried and sentenced that way, that's substance -- substantive. Pretty simple rule. What's wrong with it? Why don't we -- Why did we make Bailey retroactive? Congress could have made mere possession. I think it subsequently did, in some form. It could have changed the law and fixed the problem. How is that different than here? It could make certain class of crimes -- this defendant's particular crime, if it chose, it could take the elements of this crime and say, these are violent crimes. So how are they different? We made Bailey retroactive. But we have excluded particular conduct. We've said the residual clause can't define a violent crime. Whether it's Bailey or here, Congress has to redefine the crime. It has to step in and pass a new statute. So why is it substantive in one respect but not another? Same two things have to be done. The law has to be changed. You said when you started that Congress could change the statute to make nonuse criminal, just possession. And so Congress could change the statute and make this conduct criminal.

2015,Cuozzo Speed Technologies v. Lee,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I might be moved by your argument if Congress had not given any right for the Board to amend, because that would be consistent with practices in the district court, where district court can't amend under any circumstance. But basically, Congress here said you can amend once. I'm not sure that that supports your proposition. I'm sorry. If language is ambiguous, it can't have that plain meaning, can it? How would you have a plain meaning that a district court would apply if language is ambiguous? How could it say that you have a valid property right in something that's ambiguous? Aren't those tools used in determining the broadest -- the broadest reasonable reading, meaning how can the PTO decide what a broad reasonable reading is unless it looks at all of those factors and decides that the specifications and all the other things don't cure, continue to provide ambiguity in the patent? Mr. -- I'm sorry. Mr. Gannon, I'm -- I'm a little bit confused. You bring a patent. You go into the reexamination back and forth, with the Patent Office giving it the broadest reasonable interpretation. And you make amendments until you get to the point where the Patent Office thinks that whatever you have is clear enough to get a patent, correct? All right. So how different at the end of that process is the ordinary meaning from a continuing broad meaning? You've already had all these chances to amend, to make things as precise and as narrow as the Patent Office thinks it needs to be. All right. So when doesn't it end up in the same place? That's what I -- that's what I -- Mr. Gannon, could you give an example? I'm -- so far I'm halfway with you. If the PTO has canceled the patent, the lawsuit in the district court ends. There's nothing else for it to do. But let's assume -- Federal Circuit and -- -- assuming it loses in the Federal Circuit, the district court case has ended, correct? All right. So what does survive? Let's assume the Patent Office decides that the patent's still alive. The loser goes up to the Federal Circuit, and the Federal Circuit says this is still a patent. They've given it a meaning of -- the broadest possible meaning and said it's still valid. Now what happens in the district court? What's still alive? Give a concrete example. What's going to happen with -- in the district court? Or what can happen in the district court? How is it going to end up in a different place? Give me a concrete. Well, it can only make a differences for the district court finding the patent invalid, no? Before you -- -- time runs out -- -- I do want to go back to the appealability issue. Assuming I start from the EEOC, the Mach Mining -- Mach Mining v. EOC, which we don't easily think that Congress is intending to prevent courts from enforcing its directives to Federal agencies, okay? Number two, this is a very specific statute with steps about what -- when and when not the PTO can institute one of these reviews. There's all sorts of provisions that say you can only do it under these circumstances and only after making these findings. Your position now is that that decision is never reviewable. Justice Ginsburg asked a very intelligent question, which is, if we -- what's the purpose of it outside the APA? And your opposing colleague says there's two purposes: It precludes mandamus, and it precludes reviews of the denial to grant such a hearing. Why isn't that -- all of that enough to say there should be some review? Why would Congress tell the PTO don't do it except in these limited circumstances, but nobody's going to ever watch you to make sure that's what you're doing? So what do we do with the Federal Circuit's reading in Portola -- Portola -- Portola where it basically had similar language and said it's appealable only at the end?

Why -- why is there some sort of added burden with respect to automatic that doesn't exist with respect to permissive? Why did they bother? I -- if -- if the only issue is standing, totally different language was used by the rule drafters. And I don't think they track very well, because to require standing, you need immediacy of effect. And in a lot of these intervenor cases, it's very clear that part of the interest in the property is a contingent one. If the person loses the property, my interest will be destroyed. That's very contingent and not likely to permit standing in a lot of situations. But there's -- -- that step that you keep referring to which doesn't make any sense under Article III, which is the one about whether the existing party is adequately protecting your interests. I -- let's assume they've hired the best lawyer in the world, and they've made every conceivable argument, but you're still a contract vendor or -- with the kind of potential injury that the others assume would give you standing. Why is it that we then read Article III into Rule 24? We've said it with respect to union members who we've permitted to intervene, even though the union has all of the claimed contract rights. Yes. Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that -- because I think, as I read the district court's opinion here, they assumed you were asking for judgment in your name, because they were treating you as a contract vendor or vendee, and they were saying, you don't have the right to have a judgment in your name. Would that holding have been wrong, absent your current concession that -- that you are not seeking money in your own name, but just a payment of money? I have asked a different hypothetical. I don't know that the court below understood your claim that way. So when it ruled, it ruled understanding that you were following your complaint and seeking a -- money in your name. You disavow that in the Second Circuit. They accepted that disavowal, and they've ruled a slightly different way. I'm saying, if you hadn't, would this be the same case? And what would happen if it were a different case? So your rule is always on a motion to intervene, there is a standing inquiry. The standing inquiry is whether or not you're asking for relief different from someone with a case or controversy. ",mr katyal i be totally confused with the permissive and or automatic if it be okay to do all of this with permissive intervenor and all of the discovery and other burden that you be talk about why be not it okay to do it with automatic intervenor who be limit to only the claim of relief that the plaintiff have ask for why why be there some sort of added burden with respect to automatic that do not exist with respect to permissive why do they bother i if if the only issue be stand totally different language be use by the rule drafter and i do not think they track very well because to require standing you need immediacy of effect and in a lot of these intervenor case it be very clear that part of the interest in the property be a contingent one if the person lose the property my interest will be destroy that be very contingent and not likely to permit stand in a lot of situation but there be that step that you keep refer to which do not make any sense under article iii which be the one about whether the exist party be adequately protect your interest i let us assume they have hire the best lawyer in the world and they have make every conceivable argument but you be still a contract vendor or with the kind of potential injury that the others assume would give you stand why be it that we then read article iii into rule we have say it with respect to union member who we have permit to intervene even though the union have all of the claim contract right yes let us assume for the sake of argument that because i think as i read the district court s opinion here they assume you we be ask for judgment in your name because they we be treat you as a contract vendor or vendee and they we be say you do not have the right to have a judgment in your name would that hold have be wrong absent your current concession that that you be not seek money in your own name but just a payment of money i have ask a different hypothetical i do not know that the court below understood your claim that way so when it rule it rule understand that you we be follow your complaint and seek a money in your name you disavow that in the second circuit they accept that disavowal and they have rule a slightly different way I be say if you have not would this be the same case and what would happen if it we be a different case so your rule be always on a motion to intervene there be a stand inquiry the stand inquiry be whether or not you be ask for relief different from someone with a case or controversy ,208.68000000000004,Roberts Court,"Apr 17, 2017","Town of Chester, New York","Laroe Estates, Inc.",16-605,"Jan 13, 2017","Jun 5, 2017",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

2016,Venezuela v.

So I don't think that that ruling depended on facts; it depended on a legal conclusion. I'm sorry. What more do you want? I mean, it seems as if you're asking us for an advisory opinion of what the Court's next step should be with respect to what issues of discovery it should have on other legal issues, not on this one. It's already ruled that this complaint is sufficient as a matter of law, that this parent, under international law -- I'm not even questioning whether it's right or wrong. I know you say it's wrong and there's a serious issue of whether it's right or wrong. But are you asking us for an advisory opinion as to what the next steps are for the court below? Because we haven't granted cert on a legal question. I'm sorry. Are you arguing -- what's important? A 12(b)(6) -- -- standard, or are you in agreement with the Petitioner that all of the factual disputes have to be decided? You seem to be saying no to the second. Exactly. Let's go back to Justice Alito's question. Why I'm confused by this case is I think both the State Department and your adversary are upset that the court found that there was a viable legal argument that a parent could have property interests in the -- in the possessions of a subsidiary. Is that your understanding? I agree. What discovery would you need if they brought this as a 12(b)(6)? If they came in and said, there is no customary international property right of a parent in a subsidiary's property? What discovery would you be entitled to if they took -- if they brought a 12(b)(6) motion? I'm asking a different question. What discovery would you seek, or would you be entitled to have, on what disputed issues of fact to determine the legal question? I understand. It's the one that they proposed to the district court, which was whether H&P-IDC has standing to assert a taking in violation of international law on the issue of Venezuela's expropriation of H&-V's property.

So what happens if your initial appeal ends before the restitution order is actually entered? Have you lost your right to appeal that second, that restitution order? So does the Eleventh Circuit routinely hold their appeals until the restitution transcript is available? But it waited here. Why did it wait here? Well, I just asked whether they did it routinely, and you said not post-Dolan. So what do they do now? But they still did. So they don't know whether you're going to challenge it until the brief comes in? But they're holding it anyway. Do they give up holding it if you ask them to give it up? No, no, no. I understand we're in a mine run case. But how about in those cases where restitution orders can take a year, two years, three years? What does the Eleventh Circuit do?

2016,State Farm Fire and Casualty Co. v. U.S. ex rel. Rigsby,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"But the government starts again. The judgment that was entered here would be nullified. So then I do have one fundamental, factual question. As I'm reading the record below, the circuit, the Fifth Circuit, took the position that the only disclosure that would violate the seal requirement is the disclosure of the existence of the lawsuit. It basically said that disclosing the underlying facts is not a violation of the sealing requirement. So how did the mere disclosure of the lawsuit hurt you as opposed to what I think hurts reputation is the nature of the allegations? If the allegations were going to come out no matter what, how and why and when was there an actual disclosure of the existence of the lawsuit as opposed to just sharing with others what I understood to be the evidentiary affidavit which just sets forth allegations? So -- well, let's get to that, okay, because do we look at the situation as it existed at the time of the violation and the risk it created? Or do we look at it ex post facto and decide it didn't, in fact, happen, so there is no harm? Shouldn't the severity be determined at the time it occurred? Giving a complaint to a news media is probably the best way to tip off a defendant. It's actually more likely to do it than failing to serve the government on time for which many circuits automatically dismiss the complaint, even though that could be considered harmless if the government is served late and comes in and asks for an extension.

Hyatt does not -- -- the tribes. You're absolutely true. We haven't extended Hyatt that far yet. Recognizing the broader description of the remedy-sought analysis contained in Maxwell, that if the suit is seeking not just public funds but affects the public administration or requires the tribe to do something, it's still -- Did we reach that question? I'm sorry. What would we write that you think would affect official immunity? As I was reading your brief, I was trying to figure that out. Because you're basically announcing a rule that in individual-capacity suits, sovereign immunity is not implicated unless the remedy sought implicates the tribe directly. What else could we write that would preclude official immunity? Well, Mr. Clarke is arguing that if you're going to go back to the common law official immunity doctrine, that covered, as our Westfall case indicated, even nondiscretionary acts; that it covered every act.

2016,Moore v. Texas,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Sloan, cut to the chase of the underlying question. Was the criminal court of appeals using any clinical standard, any medical clinical standard? It was making up -- Mr. Sloan, can we go -- Can we go to the practical application of what you're saying for a moment? Let's take the decision of the CCA here. All right? They found two prongs that Mr. Moore had not met: That he couldn't prove that he was clinically intellectually disabled, that his IQ was higher than what was generally recognized clinically. What did they do wrong with respect to that prong? And then secondly, with respect to the adaptive-function prong, what did the court below do wrong? Identify the two ways in which what they're doing and how they're applying the standards we're talking about were in error. There is no medical rule to that. No medical support. Well, I thought the most significant part of this alleged error by you in your briefs were that it assumed that things like poverty, poor nutrition, poor performance in school were not attributable to intellectual functioning, but to his lack of a good home, essentially. Why is that clinically wrong? I'm sorry. Go back to Justice Kagan's question. Go ahead, and then I'll -- May I note that, as a footnote only, you can continue, that in Ex parte Sosa, the CCA sent back a case directing the lower court to apply the Briseno factors, even though that court had analyzed the case under the clinical standards. It appears to be acting as if those Briseno factors are the clinical factors and are controlling, even though there are stereotypes built into them. Well, the DMA and all the other clinicians recognized that some mentally disabled people can have some adaptive functioning. Idiot savants, for example. Is it your position that if someone can calculate math in their head they can't be intellectually disabled? How about if that same person has a job in NASA calculating the air space shuttle launches? Is that person not intellectually disabled simply because they can use that particular skill in a way that gains them employment? Mr. General, going -- just -- is it your view that what Texas is trying to do is determine who is truly on the clinical borderline as opposed to trying to determine the type of mentally disabled people that it thinks should be executed -- -- on the latter? All right. So is it fair to say that in Texas, a mildly disabled person is unlikely to be considered disabled by the CCA under the Briseno factors? But you -- according to one of the cases that you've cited to me where someone was clinically diagnosed as mildly disabled, and the CCA said under the Briseno factors that they should not be executed. A lot of the cases that you provided me with, there was clinical evidence of moderate -- and mostly severe -- but moderate to severe disability. But there -- was there anyone with mild disability that the Briseno factors would find sufficiently disabled? Did they find him mildly disabled? So why did it go through so much trouble in saying that it wasn't going to use current standards, that it was only going to use the older standards and the Briseno factors? Well, if we believe that its definition of relatedness has no support anywhere, would that have been a valid reason for discounting the current clinical standards? Well, I'm not sure how I can accept your characterization of the CCA decision when basically it's saying his poor intellectual functioning on IQ tests, which happened when he was younger, were not related to his intellectual abilities; they were related to his poverty, his -- his morbidity factors. If they are saying that, how are you saying they weren't finding that he wasn't intellectually disabled because of those other factors? That's how I read their decision. Well, wait a minute. The testimony of Compton was, having looked at all of the IQ tests, was: I'm not sure. It's probable that he's intellectually disabled by IQ, but he wouldn't qualify in my judgment because of his adaptive skills. But even the State's own expert said that it was probable that he was intellectually disabled. Well, that happened in Atkins, too. Regrettably, until we decided that mental disability was a ground to excuse execution, many mentally disabled defendants were represented by counsel who thought that arguing differently was a better strategy. Well, the problem is that, as I read the CCA opinion, it's looking at adaptive strengths only and not at adaptive deficits and looking at the depth of them or how they form the intellectual disability component. Even Dr. Compton, the State's expert, testified that Mr. Moore could not, from memory, recreate a clock. Now, she says, I don't quite believe that, but she doesn't quite believe that of a person who, at 13's, father threw him out because he was dumb and illiterate: Couldn't tell the days of the week; couldn't tell the months of the year; couldn't tell time; couldn't do anything that one would consider within an average, or even a low average, of intellectual functioning, who is eating out of garbage cans repeatedly and getting sick after each time he did it, but not learning from his mistakes. The -- the State's opinion does very little except say those are products of his poor environment; they're not products of his intellectual disability. The problem with Lennie, who the Briseno factors were -- were fashioned after -- Lennie was working on a farm. How is that different from mowing a lawn? And -- and the State had no problem in saying that Lennie, even though he could work, earn a living, plan his trying to hide the death of the rabbit he killed, that he could do all of those things, and yet he was not just mildly, but severely disabled. Why is the fact that he could mow lawns and play pool indicative of a strength that overcomes all the other deficits? But it informed its view of how to judge the lack or strength of adaptive functions. It used the Lennie standard. ",mr sloan cut to the chase of the underlying question be the criminal court of appeal use any clinical standard any medical clinical standard it be make up mr sloan can we go can we go to the practical application of what you be say for a moment let us take the decision of the cca here all right they find two prong that mr moore have not meet that he could not prove that he be clinically intellectually disabled that his iq be high than what be generally recognize clinically what do they do wrong with respect to that prong and then secondly with respect to the adaptive function prong what do the court below do wrong identify the two way in which what they be do and how they be apply the standard we be talk about we be in error there be no medical rule to that no medical support well i think the most significant part of this allege error by you in your brief we be that it assume that thing like poverty poor nutrition poor performance in school we be not attributable to intellectual functioning but to his lack of a good home essentially why be that clinically wrong I be sorry go back to justice kagan s question go ahead and then I will may i note that as a footnote only you can continue that in ex parte sosa the cca send back a case direct the low court to apply the briseno factor even though that court have analyze the case under the clinical standard it appear to be act as if those briseno factor be the clinical factor and be control even though there be stereotype build into them well the dma and all the other clinician recognize that some mentally disabled people can have some adaptive functioning idiot savant for example be it your position that if someone can calculate math in their head they can not be intellectually disable how about if that same person have a job in nasa calculate the air space shuttle launch be that person not intellectually disable simply because they can use that particular skill in a way that gain them employment mr general go just be it your view that what texas be try to do be determine who be truly on the clinical borderline as oppose to try to determine the type of mentally disabled people that it think should be execute on the latter all right so be it fair to say that in texas a mildly disabled person be unlikely to be consider disabled by the cca under the briseno factor but you accord to one of the case that you have cite to me where someone be clinically diagnose as mildly disabled and the cca say under the briseno factor that they should not be execute a lot of the case that you provide me with there be clinical evidence of moderate and mostly severe but moderate to severe disability but there be there anyone with mild disability that the briseno factor would find sufficiently disable do they find him mildly disable so why do it go through so much trouble in say that it be not go to use current standard that it be only go to use the older standard and the briseno factor well if we believe that its definition of relatedness have no support anywhere would that have be a valid reason for discount the current clinical standard well I be not sure how i can accept your characterization of the cca decision when basically it be say his poor intellectual functioning on iq test which happen when he be young we be not relate to his intellectual ability they we be relate to his poverty his his morbidity factor if they be say that how be you say they be not find that he be not intellectually disabled because of those other factor that be how i read their decision well wait a minute the testimony of compton be have look at all of the iq test be I be not sure it be probable that he be intellectually disable by iq but he would not qualify in my judgment because of his adaptive skill but even the state s own expert say that it be probable that he be intellectually disabled well that happen in atkins too regrettably until we decide that mental disability be a ground to excuse execution many mentally disabled defendant we be represent by counsel who think that argue differently be a good strategy well the problem be that as i read the cca opinion it be look at adaptive strength only and not at adaptive deficit and look at the depth of them or how they form the intellectual disability component even dr compton the state s expert testify that mr moore could not from memory recreate a clock now she say i do not quite believe that but she do not quite believe that of a person who at s father throw him out because he be dumb and illiterate could not tell the day of the week could not tell the month of the year could not tell time could not do anything that one would consider within an average or even a low average of intellectual functioning who be eat out of garbage can repeatedly and get sick after each time he do it but not learn from his mistake the the state s opinion do very little except say those be product of his poor environment they be not product of his intellectual disability the problem with lennie who the briseno factor we be we be fashion after lennie be work on a farm how be that different from mow a lawn and and the state have no problem in say that lennie even though he could work earn a living plan his try to hide the death of the rabbit he kill that he could do all of

2016,"Star Athletica, LLC v. Varsity Brands, Inc.",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"But they have put it on those other items. That's their whole point, that they've taken the pictorial design and applied it not just to a -- by the way, this is not conceding, I think, by them. They'll talk on their own and tell me -- that this isn't obvious and -- and some of your amici brief seemed to take that position, that if all we're looking at is a picture of this color blocks and stripes, that it may be too obvious to qualify for copyright protection, or not original enough, whatever. But my point is that they already have done that. They've taken the designs and not put it on a cheerleading uniform. They've put it on sweats. They've put it on both tops and bottoms. So what does that do for you? How could you copyright anything under your use of ""utility,"" under your definition of ""utility""? Every form -- I suspect in most cases, every form gives something else, an attractiveness, to the purchaser. That's why you have designs of anything, even pictorial designs. So are you suing them just for the pictures that are in their catalogue? Is that what you're suing them for? I'm sorry. You're right. I apologize. So can you get -- you could stop them from using their pictures of their uniforms in their catalogue -- -- but you can't stop them from selling their -- I transposed the two of you. I apologize.

If we don't agree with you, if we agree with them that this is a -- eligible for copyright absent some other disqualification, like obviousness or lack of creativity or whatever else, okay, assume we agree with them; what can they stop you from doing? Okay. Mr. Bursch, I go back to this point, because I'm a little confused. You started by saying to me you don't want to be stopped from manufacturing this particular uniform. What do they -- what do you think they have a copyright in? Or the -- what do you think is eligible for copyright in this picture? Isn't that the government's position too? On that point. So what can't you do, assuming that you accept what they have a copyright in, sort of the -- this thing, but not in stopping the manufacture of the uniform -- -- what do you think their copyright stops you from doing? Does the university that contracts with you know that they have to buy their uniform for you -- from you for 99 years plus whatever? Every university that you sell these cheerleading uniforms to, do they know that under your copyright, they are stuck with you forever? Why not? If you have a copyright on this design, and they have adopted their school colors, orange and black, and I presume some of these are cheerleading uniforms belonging to certain teams, they buy them and they put their names on them, correct? So why aren't they stuck with you being their only supplier of their school colors for the rest of their existence? So I'm right, once a school -- you design a uniform for a school, that's it, forever? You're killing -- you're killing knock-offs with -- with copyright. You haven't been able to do it with trademark law. You haven't been able to do it with patent designs. We are now going to use copyright law to kill the -- the knockoff industry. I don't know that that's bad. I'm just saying. But the colors do. I mean, the colors are just colors. You can -- what he is saying is you can achieve the same thing with probably most colors and stripes and whatever else is in these designs. No, they are not.

2016,Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Superior Court of California,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I'm sorry. How is it unreasonable -- -- to have -- yes. Now, you're not fighting that pending jurisdiction permits a court to take multiple claims of damages nationwide, or even worldwide, and even unrelated causes of action and bring them to a jurisdiction, correct, by one plaintiff? So you're not -- you're not claiming that that offends due process. So how do you deal -- so you're saying that pendent jurisdiction for claims that, in some way, are connected violates due process? Do you go any further? With every single individual action. And so you're destroying pendent jurisdiction on every level. That's assuming I buy your argument. Let's put it aside. But your position right now is that in no suit will one court, State court, ever be able to hear the entire controversy between a plaintiff and a defendant. Only when that's general jurisdiction. What's efficient about having piecemeal litigations across the country? For years we've been approving pendent jurisdiction, or at least not taking any case that disturbed it, and there are cases in which we've just assumed it. What's the efficiency there? And what's the reasonableness there? I'm sorry. Don't all those issues have to be decided in the 600 individual cases anyhow? The question is what's the unfairness of coordinating the common questions in one place when there is so much overlap in the essence of the claim, which is false marketing? I have no idea how you draw that line. If it is due process, then -- and how do you say that it's not due process merely because it's Federal? But that is not a Federal claim in -- that is a State law claim that would be brought in -- in Federal court. Why would due process be different? Can we go to the logic of your position? Assume a foreign corporation. Under your theory, that foreign corporation might be sued in the particular State in which an injury occurred. But since it has no home State in the United States, that means that in that situation, there's no place for plaintiffs to come together and sue that person; correct? Products are sold here across the United States. All the marketing, everything is the same. The theory is the same. But because it's a foreign State, there's no one jurisdiction -- a foreign company, there's no one jurisdiction in the United States now under your theory. There is an amicus brief here that talked about all of the criminal laws that would be subject to questioning under your theory of -- of constitutional due process. What is your response to them? Is it the same as Mr. Katyal's? We'll face that when we get to it? If due process says that you can't hail someone into a court with which they've had no contacts, how do you justify the many criminal statutes we have -- RICO, CERCLA, there's a whole bunch of them -- that permit the joinder of all of these defendants in one indictment? All of them have a civil component. Mr. Goldstein, go back to articulating for me. What is your definition of ""related to""? So is that a yes to Justice Kagan's question about it wouldn't matter if there were no California plaintiffs? Mr. Katyal, assume a set of facts that I know have not been proven. Bristol-Myers sells the drugs to McKesson. McKesson distributes the drugs to all the other States, and all of the plaintiffs have taken McKesson drugs. Under your theory, could they sue McKesson and Bristol-Myer in California? Articulate -- -- your theory in a way that it wouldn't implicate -- articulate your -- -- proximate cause and your causation theories -- -- in a way that wouldn't preclude that suit. But -- but my real problem is that -- following your theory, I'm not sure what Bristol-Myers is doing there in the California case. They -- they -- it was McKesson who sold the drugs to the plaintiffs, not Bristol-Myers directly. ",I be sorry how be it unreasonable to have yes now you be not fight that pending jurisdiction permit a court to take multiple claim of damage nationwide or even worldwide and even unrelated cause of action and bring them to a jurisdiction correct by one plaintiff so you be not you be not claim that that offend due process so how do you deal so you be say that pendent jurisdiction for claim that in some way be connect violates due process do you go any far with every single individual action and so you be destroy pendent jurisdiction on every level that be assume i buy your argument let us put it aside but your position right now be that in no suit will one court state court ever be able to hear the entire controversy between a plaintiff and a defendant only when that be general jurisdiction what be efficient about have piecemeal litigation across the country for year we have be approve pendent jurisdiction or at least not take any case that disturb it and there be case in which we have just assume it what be the efficiency there and what be the reasonableness there I be sorry do not all those issue have to be decide in the individual case anyhow the question be what be the unfairness of coordinate the common question in one place when there be so much overlap in the essence of the claim which be false marketing i have no idea how you draw that line if it be due process then and how do you say that it be not due process merely because it be federal but that be not a federal claim in that be a state law claim that would be bring in in federal court why would due process be different can we go to the logic of your position assume a foreign corporation under your theory that foreign corporation might be sue in the particular state in which an injury occur but since it have no home state in the united state that mean that in that situation there be no place for plaintiff to come together and sue that person correct product be sell here across the united state all the marketing everything be the same the theory be the same but because it be a foreign state there be no one jurisdiction a foreign company there be no one jurisdiction in the united state now under your theory there be an amicus brief here that talk about all of the criminal law that would be subject to question under your theory of of constitutional due process what be your response to them be it the same as mr katyal s we will face that when we get to it if due process say that you can not hail someone into a court with which they have have no contact how do you justify the many criminal statute we have rico cercla there be a whole bunch of them that permit the joinder of all of these defendant in one indictment all of them have a civil component mr goldstein go back to articulate for me what be your definition of related to so be that a yes to justice kagan s question about it would not matter if there we be no california plaintiff mr katyal assume a set of fact that i know have not be proven bristol myers sell the drug to mckesson mckesson distribute the drug to all the other state and all of the plaintiff have take mckesson drug under your theory could they sue mckesson and bristol myer in california articulate your theory in a way that it would not implicate articulate your proximate because and your causation theory in a way that would not preclude that suit but but my real problem be that follow your theory I be not sure what bristol myers be do there in the california case they they it be mckesson who sell the drug to the plaintiff not bristol myers directly ,278.63,Roberts Court,"Apr 25, 2017",Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.,Superior Court of California for the County of San Francisco,16-466,"Jan 19, 2017","Jun 19, 2017",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2016,Nelson v. Colorado,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Make that argument. Make that argument. The dissent here said something quite simple, which was the only entitlement to the money was the conviction. If the conviction has been voided, then what legal right does the State have to retain the money? The Colorado supreme court, on the other hand, said when you paid the money, we were entitled to it. So where -- there's a disconnect there. If they were entitled to it initially, we're still back to the operative question of why are they entitled? What is the constitutional right for you to get it back? I thought -- let's -- let's take the act. What parts of the procedure of the act are you saying violate due process? It would seem to me that if the State had an equitable reason, it should prove it, not you. Do you think the requirement to start a separate civil action comports with due process? I assume you apply the Mathews framework. Do you agree that the court got it right, or do you think even under Mathews the court below got it wrong? Should we be -- Should we be differentiating between some jurisdictions that don't collect the money until the conviction is final and a conviction that's overturned on collateral review where the possibility of money having been collected may exist? Should there be a difference in how we think about those two situations? Well, I have a problem because there are some cases in our jurisprudence -- not in English jurisprudence, but certainly in American jurisprudence where the payment of restitution to a third party would have been good reason, an equitable reason for the State not to have to return that money. So what do we do -- Paying the victim. Are you denying that there were courts -- lower courts that routinely ordered the refund of these monies? I think in the briefing, we're pointed to any number of situations in which lower courts did order -- automatically gave -- ordered the money to go back. That's, to me, a question of labels. And -- and if you have no conviction to justify the -- a payment of money because it's been voided, why is it your money now? Just simply because you collected it beforehand, even though the basis for the collection is wrong? How about if you took his car? Why isn't this comparable to forfeiture? Let's go to the stay. Could you -- can you honestly say to me that if this defendant had moved for a stay, that the trial court would have granted one? In how many cases do you think of the thousands of convictions that Colorado goes through would a court order a stay? What a wonderful procedural quagmire you're throwing on courts below. The number of vacated convictions are tiny. The number of proceedings you want now with stay motions to be determined by trial courts is hundreds, if not thousands. That's what you're advocating. You want every trial court to decide whether a stay is appropriate. For known -- the issue, I've never known us to wonder or call it a substantive due-process right to own money. Money is property. We all have a right to own our property; correct? So I'm a little confused by what you're asking for. They're saying it's my money. Whether I agree with that or don't, if it is their money, then you need to do a procedure that comports with due process; correct? And you don't deny that. How about we borrow from double jeopardy? Once the -- once the judgment is void, you no longer have a basis to that property. It's theirs. They had -- it was their money to begin with. The only basis you had to collect it or keep it was a constitutional conviction. Once it's voided, you have no basis to keep the money. ",make that argument make that argument the dissent here say something quite simple which be the only entitlement to the money be the conviction if the conviction have be void then what legal right do the state have to retain the money the colorado supreme court on the other hand say when you pay the money we we be entitle to it so where there be a disconnect there if they we be entitle to it initially we be still back to the operative question of why be they entitle what be the constitutional right for you to get it back i think let us let us take the act what part of the procedure of the act be you say violate due process it would seem to me that if the state have an equitable reason it should prove it not you do you think the requirement to start a separate civil action comports with due process i assume you apply the mathews framework do you agree that the court get it right or do you think even under mathews the court below get it wrong should we be should we be differentiate between some jurisdiction that do not collect the money until the conviction be final and a conviction that be overturn on collateral review where the possibility of money have be collect may exist should there be a difference in how we think about those two situation well i have a problem because there be some case in our jurisprudence not in english jurisprudence but certainly in american jurisprudence where the payment of restitution to a third party would have be good reason an equitable reason for the state not to have to return that money so what do we do pay the victim be you deny that there we be court low court that routinely order the refund of these monies i think in the briefing we be point to any number of situation in which low court do order automatically give order the money to go back that be to me a question of label and and if you have no conviction to justify the a payment of money because it be be voided why be it your money now just simply because you collect it beforehand even though the basis for the collection be wrong how about if you take his car why be not this comparable to forfeiture let us go to the stay could you can you honestly say to me that if this defendant have move for a stay that the trial court would have grant one in how many case do you think of the thousand of conviction that colorado go through would a court order a stay what a wonderful procedural quagmire you be throw on court below the number of vacated conviction be tiny the number of proceeding you want now with stay motion to be determine by trial court be hundred if not thousand that be what you be advocate you want every trial court to decide whether a stay be appropriate for know the issue I have never know us to wonder or call it a substantive due process right to own money money be property we all have a right to own our property correct so I be a little confused by what you be ask for they be say it be my money whether i agree with that or do not if it be their money then you need to do a procedure that comport with due process correct and you do not deny that how about we borrow from double jeopardy once the once the judgment be void you no longer have a basis to that property it be theirs they have it be their money to begin with the only basis you have to collect it or keep it be a constitutional conviction once it be void you have no basis to keep the money ,267.06,Roberts Court,"Jan 9, 2017",Shannon Nelson and Louis Alonzo Madden,Colorado,15-1256,"Sep 29, 2016","Apr 19, 2017",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

What's the -- What do you think -- I know you say all of those things. Counsel, I mean, one of my problems with all of these sites today is that none of them are purely -- or very few of them are purely anything anymore. Take something like LinkedIn, which many, many people in our society today are looking for jobs there, but high school students are permitted to look for jobs and to post their data, personal data on that site. So, is that traditional social media or not? But that's my point, which is -- I'm -- Facebook, many people, many businesses are using it for commercial advertising. Even if you don't -- Mr. -- Mr. Goldberg, why was your client using an alias? If he -- if he wasn't lurking or otherwise trying to stay hidden? Go back to Justice Kennedy's question, if you would, which is, is there a capacity to determine the age of a user; meaning, is there a way for the State to be able to track whether or not a potential defendant is actually in communication with a minor. Not if it's a Federal crime. It's much longer. I -- I -- I'm still having some difficulty because you're building layer upon layer of speculation or -- or statistical inference. Yes. There's a high statistical inference that recidivism will follow with one sexual crime to another, but then what's the statistical inference I have to draw that people who have abused a neighbor's child but never used the Internet, will now use the Internet to abuse a different child? Because this rule is not being applied to just people who have been found to have enticed a child on Facebook or some form of Internet usage. It's being applied indiscriminately to people who have committed a sexual crime of statutory rape or of -- or even if they're teenagers, more than four years apart, or something else of that nature. What -- what's the inference that every sexual offender is going to use the Internet to lure a child? But that might be true of every criminal today. Or committing almost any crime. Most of them can go onto Facebook and find the location of the bank they want to rob. They can go on the Internet and find out who's employed there. The Internet could be used for almost any crime -- -- by anyone. Can they go on the school website? Why? I got a page here with -- printed from nytimes.com, from the New York Times, where on the side there's commentary by people who have created profiles on themselves having a public discussion between them on a news article that was printed in the New York Times.

See, your way is to say that State legislatures go out and always say it's politics, because it's real easy to say politics, even though there's a lot of direct evidence that it really was race, and put the added burden on a plaintiff now to do a map where you'll come up and say on their map, oh, ah, this takes care of this problem, but there's another political reason for not doing it that way. There's another political reason for not doing it this way. It's impossible to ask a plaintiff to come up with a race-neutral map in light of the entire region.

2016,Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Fisher, why? Why? Why? I mean, you know, the Chief says this is not an equal protection case, but the Sixth Amendment applies to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment; correct? I always thought the most pernicious and odious discrimination in our law is based on race. All right. So why is a rule that says, given the exceptions we've recognized since the 1800s that have said that race is the most pernicious thing in our justice system, why can't we limit this just to race using principles of the Fourteenth Amendment as well? Mr. -- please, please concentrate on the question Justice Breyer -- -- has asked you, which is answer his question, he's talking about the general principle. He says everybody is afraid to open the door. All right? And to the extent that your answer is simply the door is open once you rule for me, because other bias is going to be viewed the same, it's going to hurt you. That's what Justice Breyer said. So tell me why that fear is not valid. And then gender. The second is very different from the first. That second -- I like the second better because what -- otherwise, you're going to have an evidentiary hearing in every allegation, and 20 jurisdictions don't, right? There has to be a test that tells you when, what's the difference between a stray remark -- -- and something that has impact. Do you have any evidence that in the 20 jurisdictions that permit this -- this challenge that they've been overwhelmed with cases? Well, you can't prove a negative. That's -- that's almost impossible. So I want you to tell me the positive. Is there evidence of some run-amuck sort of number of motions filed in any particular case based on racial discrimination, rampant jury harassment, any of the evils that you are predicting in your brief? What -- what exception would you recognize? As far back as Reed we have said -- qualified 606(b)'s -- predecessors in 606(b). Wagner said it: There might be a case so extreme that we would not apply this rule. If race is not so extreme, what, in your judgment, would be? Well, right now, we don't permit or require questioning on bias except for race in voir dire, so where does your exception work? Because things do creep in. We don't make exceptions for those things. The problem is it assumes that if the question is asked that every juror is going to be truthful. You know, different people can have different experiences. But, you know, it is more rare than common that when a question is asked is anyone biased that most jurors won't raise their hand. Well, why? Isn't -- you know, there's a lot of talk about political correctness or not. And some people think it's a negative thing, and others think it's a positive thing. But if an individual is harboring racial bias, isn't it better to harbor it than infect everyone else's deliberations on the basis of it? I mean, if you're not saying every Mexican commits this kind of crime, but you're forced to argue the evidence to convince your jurors, isn't that exactly what we want? Don't we want deliberations on evidence and not deliberations on someone's stereotypes and feelings about the race of a defendant? So why shouldn't we try to drive it underground?

2016,Samsung Electronics Co. v. Apple Inc.,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Ms. Sullivan, you seem to be arguing, as when you opened, that as a matter of law, you were right. And I don't see that as a matter of law. I believe that your basic argument, everyone is in agreement, that the test is an article of manufacture for purposes of sale. But I am like Justice Kennedy, which is, how do we announce the right test for that? Because the phone could be seen by a public -- a purchasing consumer as being just that rounded edge, slim outer shell. That might be what drives the sale. I don't know. Certainly your expert didn't tell me how to figure out the component part. I don't know where in the record you would have enough to survive your argument. Now, I look at this record, and they were claiming the profits on the whole phone. If you read the Federal Circuit's decision, they were saying people buy -- bought this product mostly -- this was their argument to the jury and it sold the Federal Circuit -- because of the look of this phone, that, you know, all smartphones basically function the same. People don't really put much value on the unit. This is what they were arguing, and they put on an expert that gave total profits. If the jury credited them, could you -- and you were properly -- it was a properly instructed jury, could you overturn that finding? I accept that, Miss Sullivan. I'm asking you -- And you're answering ""no"" to my question. You're saying a properly instructed jury on the evidence presented in this case could not have found for Apple. Is that what -- So besides the jury instruction, what was the legal error? I said besides a properly instructed jury, could they have found in favor of Apple on the evidence presented? And so what, besides the jury instruction -- because I'm assuming that a proper instruction was given -- what would have been the legal error? Well, you can't claim the design patent for a Volkswagen doesn't cover the innards, but you just admitted that a jury could find its -- could find that the consumers and others would perceive the Volkswagen to be a Volkswagen by its looks only. I don't disagree with you, but -- What's the first step, and how do you figure it out? But that's the first part of the test. That's the article of manufacture. So now take the second part of the test and apply it to the Bug. Exactly. Mr. Waxman, can we go back to the government's test, because if -- so far your test has a lot of steps, but I don't know what it's going towards. Okay. They suggest two things. Article of manufacture is the article of manufacture. They have a four-part test. Do you agree that that four-part test with respect to identifying just the article of manufacture? Please don't go to the -- to the record. All right. That's the test. So let's assume, because it makes logical sense to me, it may not to anybody else, okay, that the Volkswagen body, not the innards, are the article of manufacture. Now, the government would say, go to the second test, which takes in some of the things that you were talking about, to figure out how much of the profits that VW makes from the Bug are attributable to the shape of the car. Now, as Justice Alito said, some people don't care a wit about the shape of the car. They want just a small car. They want the car that has a certain trunk. People buy cars for a multitude of reasons. Experts would come in and say, but it's 90 percent of the profits. It may be that the body accounts for only 10 percent of the cost of the car, but 90 percent of the profits are attributable to the shape of the car. What's wrong with that analysis? That's what I understand the government's analysis to be. That that's what a jury has to be told to do, to decide how much value the design is to the product being sold. That's the government's test in a nutshell. Please don't get off track. Do you endorse that part of the government's test? How we measure it, you're saying, hasn't been briefed adequately. The government is saying the same thing. But is -- conceptually, is that right? ",ms sullivan you seem to be argue as when you open that as a matter of law you we be right and i do not see that as a matter of law i believe that your basic argument everyone be in agreement that the test be an article of manufacture for purpose of sale but i be like justice kennedy which be how do we announce the right test for that because the phone could be see by a public a purchase consumer as be just that round edge slim outer shell that might be what drive the sale i do not know certainly your expert do not tell me how to figure out the component part i do not know where in the record you would have enough to survive your argument now i look at this record and they we be claim the profit on the whole phone if you read the federal circuit s decision they we be say people buy buy this product mostly this be their argument to the jury and it sell the federal circuit because of the look of this phone that you know all smartphones basically function the same people do not really put much value on the unit this be what they we be argue and they put on an expert that give total profit if the jury credit them could you and you we be properly it be a properly instructed jury could you overturn that find i accept that miss sullivan I be ask you and you be answer no to my question you be say a properly instructed jury on the evidence present in this case could not have find for apple be that what so besides the jury instruction what be the legal error i say besides a properly instructed jury could they have find in favor of apple on the evidence present and so what besides the jury instruction because I be assume that a proper instruction be give what would have be the legal error well you can not claim the design patent for a volkswagen do not cover the innards but you just admit that a jury could find its could find that the consumer and others would perceive the volkswagen to be a volkswagen by its look only i do not disagree with you but what be the first step and how do you figure it out but that be the first part of the test that be the article of manufacture so now take the second part of the test and apply it to the bug exactly mr waxman can we go back to the government s test because if so far your test have a lot of step but i do not know what it be go towards okay they suggest two thing article of manufacture be the article of manufacture they have a four part test do you agree that that four part test with respect to identify just the article of manufacture please do not go to the to the record all right that be the test so let us assume because it make logical sense to me it may not to anybody else okay that the volkswagen body not the innards be the article of manufacture now the government would say go to the second test which take in some of the thing that you we be talk about to figure out how much of the profit that vw make from the bug be attributable to the shape of the car now as justice alito say some people do not care a wit about the shape of the car they want just a small car they want the car that have a certain trunk people buy car for a multitude of reason expert would come in and say but it be percent of the profit it may be that the body account for only percent of the cost of the car but percent of the profit be attributable to the shape of the car what be wrong with that analysis that be what i understand the government s analysis to be that that be what a jury have to be tell to do to decide how much value the design be to the product be sell that be the government s test in a nutshell please do not get off track do you endorse that part of the government s test how we measure it you be say have not be brief adequately the government be say the same thing but be conceptually be that right ,316.23,Roberts Court,"Oct 11, 2016","Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., et al.",Apple Inc.,15-777,"Mar 21, 2016","Dec 6, 2016",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2016,Lightfoot v. Cendant Mortgage Corporation,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Now, is there a difference in a sue-to-be -- a right-to-sue provision from a provision creating a cause of action? Let's do the Age Discrimination and Employment Act, which authorizes suit in any Federal district court of competent jurisdiction. How do you deal with the fact that the ADA generally is viewed as limiting jurisdiction to Federal courts? Well, there, I'm presuming they mean personal jurisdiction. So in context, one would read competent jurisdiction there as personal jurisdiction. Well, that's arguably to keep all suits in D.C. as opposed to somewhere; else. I've done -- or had -- my clerk did a study, and there are, that she has been able to identify, eight other statutes that use the ""incompetent jurisdiction"" language. Are -- are -- A, are you aware of the number of other statutes that are identical to this? And, B, are you troubled by the fact that some of those statutes may not be a private corporation fully the way Fannie Mae is? We are off by one. But tell me what you mean. So a Federal question would be -- So those are five statutes that don't -- is not -- are -- don't involve Federal agency, are similar to the HUD and Veterans, the two -- Have all of them read the statute in the same way you have? What happens to all the judgments that have been entered, reading this the way the Ninth Circuit did, all the past cases, in that split jurisdiction with district courts going other ways? What happens to those old judgments where there wasn't Federal subject-matter jurisdiction? If we read things the way you want us to read them. How could you have res judicata if you never had subject-matter jurisdiction? But why didn't they do the same thing in Ginnie Mae? They chose very different language, so doesn't that show a conscious act. We now have three versions, but that's okay. (Laughter.) So why didn't they do that for Fannie Mae?

Let's say a State has a headquarters in Delaware. It sells 51 percent of its goods in New York and 51 percent -- and 49 percent in California. Almost equal number of employees, a difference of 10 percent, let's say. Same amount of property, whatever. And I'm assuming this railroad could fit that description in a number of States.

2016,Bank of America Corp. v. City of Miami,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I'm sorry. In Havens, the testers were not city employees. In Havens, they were private organizational employees whose job it was to do this. So why are you attributing the testers' work to the City directly? Why is this different than the other allegations in Havens that had to do, like here, with lost revenues, with lost tax base, which the Court cited as well? Here there are direct expenditures in terms of increased monitoring of the area by police and other services. Aren't those City expenditures? I'm sorry. I apologize. I'm sorry, but you're thinking that if banks are forcing people out of a neighborhood, that that's not discrimination? Mr. Katyal, this is not an express -- an express limitation that means we're not -- we're doing away or we are keeping the zone of interest, because Lexmark itself was -- just establishes that rule. There was no explicit statement. What the Court did was look at the statute, the endangered species statute, look at its words, and decide that ""any person"" meant any person and decided it did away with the zone of interests. Here, we have a Congress in 1988 taking the word ""aggrieved,"" which was in the -- in Title VII and many other statutes but undefined. And what it did was take the definition looked at by prior regulations, examined by this Court in its three cases establishing Article III standing, and put in a definition of ""aggrieved"" that is very different from the normal definition. Why is that -- So -- So what do we do with all of the statements in Havens? I'm quoting. ""There is little significance in the difference between direct and indirect injuries for purposes of filing suit under the FHA. Trafficante. While members of minority groups were damaged the most from discrimination, the proponents of the legislation emphasize that those who were not the direct objects of discrimination had an interest in ensuring fair housing."" Well, I mean -- -- we have repeatedly said -- -- the difference between direct and indirect, it has no meaning in the statute. The foreseeability always has meaning. I'm looking at the Joint Appendix, page 186, your opening paragraph where you say, ""BoA's conduct has harmed the residents of Miami and impaired the"" -- ""the City's strong, long-standing, and active commitment to open integrated residential housing patterns and its attendant benefits of creating a stable community -- community."" And then you go on to the specific damages, the loss of tax revenues, and increased expenses. It's those types of allegations in your amended complaint that you're pointing to? This pretty much tracks Havens and Gladstone. Mr. Peck, would you go back to the question the Chief started with, which is, how do you define the limits of your foresee -- foreseeability tests? Clearly less tourism. Less sales tax. Less of a lot of other things can be potentially foreseeable, but you're suggesting they are not recoverable. So is it because they are not foreseeable or is it because they are not measurable? Mr. Gannon, how do -- how do we write it? Let's take the corner grocer who had a running account with that home or the gardener who every week cleaned the property. I doubt someone who is in foreclosure can afford a gardener, but let's assume that possibility. Why -- how do we write that the City has standing and its injuries are proximately caused, but those people don't? The company shareholder. What's -- how do we say it? So your answer -- Your answer, I think, to the question is that it's limited to those cognizable suits contemplated by the statute, and you see contemplated by the statute as having to do with the possession or value of the property? Well, it's hard to think that Congress didn't know that in 1988, when we've already let a village come in, in a municipality.

2016,Buck v. Davis,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"The centers in this case -- -- argue that the Court had improperly denied a COA, and that was their basic position. They didn't really engage the merits; they just engaged the standard of issuance of a COA. We go back to that. Are you satisfied if we say they used the wrong standard for denying the COA, or will you only be satisfied if we say you win? All right. Now let's start with the COA issue. With respect to the COA issue, I read your adversaries who are -- to say Martinez, Trevino could never constitute an exceptional circumstance to -- to justify the issuance of a COA. Basically that's their position, because they weren't made retroactive. So first, what does the retroactivity argument have to do with anything? All right? What does it apply to? And aren't you making Martinez and -- and Trevino retroactive if we recognize it as an exceptional reason to forgive a procedural default. And then second, there's a circuit split on this question, and you recognize it in your brief. You have the Third Circuit using a three-part test that says Martinez and Trevino, under certain circumstances, can be a reason to find exceptional circumstance. The Ninth Circuit has a six- or seven- or eight-part test. They never make it simple. And the Fifth says never. Where do you stand on all these tests? And what's your position with respect to this -- to this retroactivity question? That's the Third Circuit test, isn't it? Counselor, I know that there's been a lot of talk about how small the reference to race was with respect to the questioning at trial on both sides, but how much was it a part of the actual report, because that's what the jury asked for? And they asked for two things: Could they consider life without parole? So they were obviously considering mercy. Somebody was. I don't know if all of them, but someone wanted to talk about it, that's what they told the judge. Can we talk about life without -- life without parole? I don't even know what the answer to that was. I should have checked that -- -- but if you do you, can tell me? But, number two, they asked for the psychiatric report. Does that -- not to have the testimony reread, but for the report. So tell me what -- how that changes the calculus, those two things in any way. How old was Mr. Buck? How old was Mr. Buck at the time? Why does it matter who uses race? I mean, in Batson challenges we don't care if the person exercising a racial challenge is the prosecutor or the defense attorney. We say neither should use race in a negative way against a defendant. So why is it different here? Why is it okay or not okay for the prosecutor to introduce the greater likelihood of a person being dangerous on the basis of race alone? Not okay for the prosecutor, but it's less bad for the defense attorney to do it? Well, the level of prejudice is the reasonable possibility that if one juror, because Texas uses one juror does not agree with death, death is not imposed, correct? So if one -- is it a reasonable possibility that one juror, even the one who sent the note that says is it possible to do parole, life without parole, could have been convinced to exercise mercy if race wasn't used, can you answer that question ""absolutely not""? When, in at least one of the Saldano cases, a man poured gasoline on a woman and watched her die, we had a nation that was mortified, shocked, and completely traumatized by watching a pilot burn to death. So why is that crime any less heinous than this one? I don't say it's not, but why is that heinousness so much greater that no jury could have exercised mercy? No juror. ""Reasonable probability"" is the actual language, not ""substantial."" Oral argument -- oral argument on whether to grant the COA? It doesn't say anything to the Fifth Circuit that three State court judges, two of their colleagues on the Fifth Circuit, two justices of this Court, have said or found Mr. Buck's case debatable, because that's the standard. It's debatable. They don't pause and say, you know, people have some basis for an argument here? This is not frivolous. This is a serious question. That's not the issue. They are supposed to decide whether to grant COA or not on whether the questions are serious or not, debatable, not decide the merits. I know it can appear a fine line in some situations, but how do you justify saying that this is not debatable? ",the center in this case argue that the court have improperly deny a coa and that be their basic position they do not really engage the merit they just engage the standard of issuance of a coa we go back to that be you satisfied if we say they use the wrong standard for deny the coa or will you only be satisfy if we say you win all right now let us start with the coa issue with respect to the coa issue i read your adversary who be to say martinez trevino could never constitute an exceptional circumstance to to justify the issuance of a coa basically that be their position because they be not make retroactive so first what do the retroactivity argument have to do with anything all right what do it apply to and be not you make martinez and and trevino retroactive if we recognize it as an exceptional reason to forgive a procedural default and then second there be a circuit split on this question and you recognize it in your brief you have the third circuit use a three part test that say martinez and trevino under certain circumstance can be a reason to find exceptional circumstance the ninth circuit have a six or seven or eight part test they never make it simple and the fifth say never where do you stand on all these test and what be your position with respect to this to this retroactivity question that be the third circuit test be not it counselor i know that there be be a lot of talk about how small the reference to race be with respect to the question at trial on both side but how much be it a part of the actual report because that be what the jury ask for and they ask for two thing could they consider life without parole so they we be obviously consider mercy somebody be i do not know if all of them but someone want to talk about it that be what they tell the judge can we talk about life without life without parole i do not even know what the answer to that be i should have check that but if you do you can tell me but number two they ask for the psychiatric report do that not to have the testimony reread but for the report so tell me what how that change the calculus those two thing in any way how old be mr buck how old be mr buck at the time why do it matter who use race i mean in batson challenge we do not care if the person exercise a racial challenge be the prosecutor or the defense attorney we say neither should use race in a negative way against a defendant so why be it different here why be it okay or not okay for the prosecutor to introduce the great likelihood of a person be dangerous on the basis of race alone not okay for the prosecutor but it be less bad for the defense attorney to do it well the level of prejudice be the reasonable possibility that if one juror because texas use one juror do not agree with death death be not impose correct so if one be it a reasonable possibility that one juror even the one who send the note that say be it possible to do parole life without parole could have be convince to exercise mercy if race be not use can you answer that question absolutely not when in at least one of the saldano case a man pour gasoline on a woman and watch her die we have a nation that be mortify shock and completely traumatize by watch a pilot burn to death so why be that crime any less heinous than this one i do not say it be not but why be that heinousness so much great that no jury could have exercise mercy no juror reasonable probability be the actual language not substantial oral argument oral argument on whether to grant the coa it do not say anything to the fifth circuit that three state court judge two of their colleague on the fifth circuit two justice of this court have say or find mr buck s case debatable because that be the standard it be debatable they do not pause and say you know people have some basis for an argument here this be not frivolous this be a serious question that be not the issue they be suppose to decide whether to grant coa or not on whether the question be serious or not debatable not decide the merit i know it can appear a fine line in some situation but how do you justify say that this be not debatable ,374.97000000000014,Roberts Court,"Oct 5, 2016",Duane Edward Buck,"Lorie Davis, Director, Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Correctional Institutions Division",15-8049,"Jun 6, 2016","Feb 22, 2017",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

But there are some cases that use the word ""unenforceable"" in that sense. Their timing. I'm sorry, but don't lose the estoppel argument there. I want to hear what you were going to say. So is estoppel an unenforceable -- unenforceable? Render the patent unenforceable? Just like here with laches. But the problem with that argument that you're making is that, yes, that was said. But we don't know what they had in mind. There's nothing to show us directly what they had in mind, other than what they spoke, and they spoke about the traditional conditions like patent misuse and the other things that are specified. I still don't see in the history where the people who were drafting at the time, not two years later or time later, really were thinking of this in the way you're speaking of. You won't get very far with me on that, because I don't know how to import something in that's not stated by Congress in any way. Mr. Waxman, can you get to Justice Breyer's question?

2016,"McLane Company, Inc. v. E.E.O.C",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"So -- Can you clarify for me exactly what's on appeal? There are essentially two rulings by the district court, one on the pedigree information sought -- the name, address, Social Security number, et cetera, of the people who had taken the strength test at issue -- and a second part, a disclosure of the reasons for the termination of the employees who had failed the test. As I read the record below, the district court did not give a reason for denying the second request. And the court of appeals basically said, we can't under any standard of review credit a non-reason for denying something, so we reverse the district court on that. Are you challenging that particular ruling, that reversal of that part of the request? So are you reversing that? Are you -- are you appealing that part of the remand? All right. So the only thing that's at issue here is the district court's failure to order the release of the pedigree, what I'm calling the pedigree information. On the second question. I'm -- I'm sorry. I -- I thought I understood that you disclosed who took the test, who failed it, and whether someone was later terminated. But not the reason for the termination. And so -- So why isn't the reason for termination relevant to the charge? If your terminating keeps only women for failing the test, but keeping men and maybe some terminating later for some other reason, doesn't that show that there's a problem? Now, where do you -- I'll allow on rebuttal. My question was where do you get the undue burden? But you can answer on rebuttal. Could you please tell me -- walk me through exactly what you think, the government thinks, is what the court, district court is doing when it makes a decision to enforce a subpoena? What are the legal steps? What are the factual steps? I'm not quite sure. And -- and then embodied in that is your -- Petitioner says there's an undue burden part of this test as well. I don't know where that comes from because it certainly doesn't come from Morton Salt or Shell Oil. So you tell me what you think is at issue. And -- and tell me where you're getting that from. I mean your standard. Okay? I'm sorry. I -- I -- under 401, which is a discovery rule, we review that for relevance for abuse of discretion. Why is that any different here than it is under Rule 401? So if we take the -- so you don't have a problem in saying that it's within the discretion of the district court reviewing the EEOC -- -- to decide relevancy? And -- and it's only the court of appeals, then, who has to review it as a matter of law? I'm a little -- I'm a little -- It doesn't under 401. Under 401, it resides both in the district court and in -- on the -- in the court of appeals as an abuse-of-discretion standard of review. I'm having a very hard time with your answer. I've never heard of any test that's given that's not in some way job-related. I mean -- You can -- you can basically give a test that says is your hair true blonde or not? And even though it has no relationship to the job, you can give that test and fire people basically because they are not true blonds?

2016,Murr v. Wisconsin,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"So where does regulatory -- a State's regulatory power come in? This -- Justice Kagan put in a hypothetical to -- to this one owner owns two parcels or two different people own two parcels, and they sell it to your one owner. And the one owner knows the regulation says if you have two contiguous land pieces, you can only develop on one, if they're both below an acre or whatever the rule is. Your rule would just do away with your expectations as a buyer. But the parents -- it may have been a taking for the parents, but they never charged it. The children when they took were subject to the regulation, and they knew it. They could have said, no, I don't want two contiguous ones, Dad and Mom. I'll go buy the next-door lot from someone else. They should have known. May I -- May I ask a question? I do think, as I'm reading all of the briefs in this case, that the issue is how much weight should we be giving to the State boundary lines, the State property lines. You say as a denominator on the takings claim, there -- it's fixed. You used the word ""presumption"" in your brief, but you haven't explained to me what overcomes the State boundary line -- property lines, so I don't think the word ""presumption"" has any meaning in your brief. Others, like St. Croix and -- and the government, and embedded in Justice Breyer's question, thinks the denominator should be a more nuanced calculation, although St. Croix, Wisconsin, and the Solicitor General seem to have a different weight to that. So let's start with, is yours a fixed presumption? Does anything ever overcome it? Or is it, under every circumstance, the denominator? What over -- -- comes that? What overcomes that? So what's the difference between that and the factors that the other parties are using that says look at how the property's been used over time. Here, the family has a house on one parcel, a volleyball court and a barbecue storage area on another. They use the other parcel -- house on one side, the other parcel has access to the beach. The house has not had an economic value to the children. It was there. They're using it. So what's the difference -- -- in terms of -- I'm sorry. I've had a problem with the appraisal figures, and it may be a step I'm missing. Why would anybody pay $400,000 for a lot they can't build on? The two values -- your example said the two lots put together are less valuable, or more valuable? Yeah. I know there's only a ten percent difference. But as I understood the appraisal figures, and are now using estimates, each lot was worth about 350 and 400,000 separately, for a value of 750. Together they were valued at 680. So they weren't -- you didn't double the price -- I understand why the combination, but why would anybody buy the lot you can't develop on? The problem I have with your test, which has the -- the three components, is I don't actually see anywhere in there any weight given to the State property lines. You don't explicitly list it among those three items. You don't tell us how you're weighing it or not weighing it, what presumptions you're giving it or not. So where does it fit in to your -- your -- your three factors? If we think there should be more of a role, where would you put it? St. Croix puts it on the second prong. Where would you end up putting it, and why do you disagree with how they use it? Well, I actually think they did it -- the parents did it after the ordinance's, from my timeline, creation. The ordinance was passed in 1976. And in 1982, the parents took the property under common ownership from the Atlantic Plumbing Company. So neither the parents or the children, if they had been paying attention to the regulatory scheme, had a reasonable expectation that the ordinance wouldn't affect them. With the regulations that affect those boundaries. With the regulations that affect those boundaries. Whether it's a title company or anyone else -- -- they look at what the paper talks about as a property line and what regulations do with respect to that line. So what do we do -- -- with the fact as I see it that these properties were bought separately, one by the parents, the other by their company, and that post regulations, knowing exactly what they were doing -- and you say they didn't, but that has to do with their choice, because you buy everything subject to regulation. You may not choose to look at it, but you -- you should. Ignorance of the law is not a defense anywhere. I don't know why it should be in the regulatory context. But putting that aside, they took the title to the property in their own names post regulation. But you get to use everything you own with -- subject to regulatory requirements. I buy a piece of property 10 years ago or 20 years ago, and I didn't know I had to put a sprinkler system in. Today, if you want to do any kind of renovation, you got to put one in. There's lots of regulations that you didn't buy expecting -- -- but they do affect you. They -- They -- They didn't buy them. They got them in 1982 subject to knowing that they could only develop on one. ",so where do regulatory a state s regulatory power come in this justice kagan put in a hypothetical to to this one owner own two parcel or two different people own two parcel and they sell it to your one owner and the one owner know the regulation say if you have two contiguous land piece you can only develop on one if they be both below an acre or whatever the rule be your rule would just do away with your expectation as a buyer but the parent it may have be a take for the parent but they never charge it the child when they take we be subject to the regulation and they know it they could have say no i do not want two contiguous one dad and mom I will go buy the next door lot from someone else they should have know may i may i ask a question i do think as I be read all of the brief in this case that the issue be how much weight should we be give to the state boundary line the state property line you say as a denominator on the taking claim there it be fix you use the word presumption in your brief but you have not explain to me what overcome the state boundary line property line so i do not think the word presumption have any meaning in your brief others like st croix and and the government and embed in justice breyer s question think the denominator should be a more nuanced calculation although st croix wisconsin and the solicitor general seem to have a different weight to that so let us start with be yours a fixed presumption do anything ever overcome it or be it under every circumstance the denominator what over come that what overcome that so what be the difference between that and the factor that the other party be use that say look at how the property s be use over time here the family have a house on one parcel a volleyball court and a barbecue storage area on another they use the other parcel house on one side the other parcel have access to the beach the house have not have an economic value to the child it be there they be use it so what be the difference in term of I be sorry I have have a problem with the appraisal figure and it may be a step I be miss why would anybody pay for a lot they can not build on the two value your example say the two lot put together be less valuable or more valuable yeah i know there be only a ten percent difference but as i understand the appraisal figure and be now use estimate each lot be worth about and separately for a value of together they we be value at so they be not you do not double the price i understand why the combination but why would anybody buy the lot you can not develop on the problem i have with your test which have the the three component be i do not actually see anywhere in there any weight give to the state property line you do not explicitly list it among those three item you do not tell us how you be weigh it or not weigh it what presumptions you be give it or not so where do it fit in to your your your three factor if we think there should be more of a role where would you put it st croix put it on the second prong where would you end up put it and why do you disagree with how they use it well i actually think they do it the parent do it after the ordinance s from my timeline creation the ordinance be pass in and in the parent take the property under common ownership from the atlantic plumbing company so neither the parent or the child if they have be pay attention to the regulatory scheme have a reasonable expectation that the ordinance would not affect them with the regulation that affect those boundary with the regulation that affect those boundary whether it be a title company or anyone else they look at what the paper talk about as a property line and what regulation do with respect to that line so what do we do with the fact as i see it that these property we be buy separately one by the parent the other by their company and that post regulation know exactly what they we be do and you say they do not but that have to do with their choice because you buy everything subject to regulation you may not choose to look at it but you you should ignorance of the law be not a defense anywhere i do not know why it should be in the regulatory context but put that aside they take the title to the property in their own name post regulation but you get to use everything you own with subject to regulatory requirement i buy a piece of property year ago or year ago and i do not know i have to put a sprinkler system in today if you want to do any kind of renovation you get to put one in there have lot of regulation that you do not buy expect but they do affect you they they they do not buy them they get them in subject to know that they could only develop on one ,365.4,Roberts Court,"Mar 20, 2017","Joseph P.

2016,McWilliams v. Dunn,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Bright, that is the essence of this. Another -- there is a lot of talk about independent, neutral, defense expert, but really what's at issue is what kind of aid a defendant is entitled to to mount a viable defense, correct? And so once there is evidence -- and here, there was evidence at the last moment -- that, in fact, as the prior experts have testified that certain tests should be taken, that certain signs of organic brain injury were present, once that was confirmed, what the expert was saying to the Court is now I need help. Because this expert is -- this court-appointed expert is telling us that all these things really are irrelevant to my defense, but I have a viable claim that organic brain injury exists, and that it might have an effect and provide me with a defense. So I need assistance in determining that, correct? In what other area do we permit the State or a court to appoint -- to not fund an expert once there is viable evidence of a potential defense? In the -- in any area. Now, I'm not sure that you've answered Justice Kennedy's question. He started with the observation that there is an argument.

How do you get to the point that this was sufficiently clearly established at the time of this case so that it was an unreasonable application of law by the court below? But, Mr. Bright, why is that wrong? Why -- why is it wrong to ask an expert that's been provided to the defense to do that? -- to say I have to defend this man, give me my best argument. Not lawyers, experts.

Did I not tell Your Honor that?"" And shortly thereafter he says, ""Your Honor gave me no time in which to do that. Your Honor told me to be here at 2:00 this afternoon.

2016,Honeycutt v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I have just a practical question. Would our -- how would our ruling here affect the RICO forfeiture statute, 1963? The language is very similar. So if we rule in your favor, does that mean we undo the RICO statute as well? RICO may be easier to prove the joint-and-several concept because RICO is an enterprise as defined. Mr. -- I'm having trouble with just one component of your argument, many, but one that for the moment, which is the one that led the -- the one court who's against -- -- on this this issue was the courier who receives 50 dollars a week or 50 dollars a trip to deliver drugs. Under your theory that courier who on everyone facts doesn't see more than 50 dollars of whatever the profit is of this drug enterprise, that courier is responsible for a million dollars, 2 million dollars, 3 million dollars criminal conspiracy because he took an undisputedly small part. Now, assume what logic in -- in rem theory would ever make a person who's never obtaining that money, those proceeds responsible for the larger sum? Why should the drug dealer, who in fact got all of the money, minus 50 dollars, why should he be off-the-hook for even a penny less than what he put in his pocket because the courier happened to have a hundred dollars saved? Well -- That's generally what a courier is responsible for that -- the drug deals he or she is involved in. And for those that are reasonably within the scope of the conspiracy. You'll serve a lot of years in jail. But why does that give you, assuming you're a victim, the government. Greater rights against that one individual as opposed to what forfeiture tends to mean against the proceeds of the crime. You're getting a remedy that's literally unheard of in the background principles of forfeiture. In what -- In what other setting other than in RICO and 853? In what other setting of law has a similar concept ever existed? Concept where you're going to be personally liable for something greater than what you directly obtained. ",i have just a practical question would our how would our ruling here affect the rico forfeiture statute the language be very similar so if we rule in your favor do that mean we undo the rico statute as well rico may be easy to prove the joint and several concept because rico be an enterprise as define mr I be have trouble with just one component of your argument many but one that for the moment which be the one that lead the the one court who be against on this this issue be the courier who receive dollar a week or dollar a trip to deliver drug under your theory that courier who on everyone fact do not see more than dollar of whatever the profit be of this drug enterprise that courier be responsible for a million dollar million dollar million dollar criminal conspiracy because he take an undisputedly small part now assume what logic in in rem theory would ever make a person who be never obtain that money those proceeds responsible for the large sum why should the drug dealer who in fact get all of the money minus dollar why should he be off the hook for even a penny less than what he put in his pocket because the courier happen to have a hundred dollar save well that be generally what a courier be responsible for that the drug deal he or she be involve in and for those that be reasonably within the scope of the conspiracy you will serve a lot of year in jail but why do that give you assume you be a victim the government great right against that one individual as oppose to what forfeiture tend to mean against the proceeds of the crime you be get a remedy that be literally unheard of in the background principle of forfeiture in what in what other set other than in rico and in what other setting of law have a similar concept ever exist concept where you be go to be personally liable for something great than what you directly obtain ,158.69000000000003,Roberts Court,"Mar 29, 2017",Terry Michael Honeycutt,United States,16-142,"Dec 9, 2016","Jun 5, 2017",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2016,Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc.,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I'm sorry. Could you clarify? Does that mean that the FDA can't announce its intent to approve on year 12 plus 1 earlier than year 12, or -- I'm not quite sure I understand. How long does it take for the FDA to approve the biosimilar? Assuming you go through Phase I, and there is -- and Phase II has been finished. How long -- those run independent of the FDA approval, correct? So how long -- I want you to go back to Justice Kennedy, but I just want to get a sense of timing. How long does it generally take for the FDA to say, this is okay effective 12 plus 1? No, no. I'm trying to get the process down. It takes them 10 months. Let's assume you put in an application in year 4. Do they have to wait until when to announce that it's okay? When do they tell you that they will? Can I go back to the beginning of Justice Breyer's question. He made an assumption that until the approval of the product, that the other side won't know exactly what it is that's going to be approved, particularly in a situation like this, where you -- you've kept your application from them so they don't have it. Take -- address that issue. In your brief you say they can get it. They can get it from the industry, from the SEC filings, from -- from FDA talk, all of that stuff. But that won't tell them exactly what it is that you're intending to market. So -- or the other side -- how -- how would you know? If you start a declaratory-judgment action, as you're entitled to do, wouldn't you know then? Couldn't you get it in discovery? Could it -- could the company with the product file a declaratory-judgment action when they don't know what you're going to do? Do they have a good-faith basis for believing you're going to infringe if they don't have the application to look at until they get discovery? Tell me how. I'm sorry. If the biosimilar files a notice of intent to file the application and a copy of the application, if it complies with all of the steps in Phase 1, does it estop the bio -- the -- the licensed product holder from seeking a declaratory-judgment action? Well, that's assuming good faith. And that's the next question, which is if you -- if the biosimilar doesn't comply, you're saying the other side can sue. But what happens if you do comply? Can the other side -- and the other side fails to, they -- they don't give you the notice that they're required to. They don't do something that's required on their part in that exchange process. What is your biosimilars remedy in that case? All incentives have a way of failing. Just look at our society. So -- (Laughter.) Mr. Yang, do -- Do we have your assurances that this is the FDA's position? Has it been a consistent position in other situations? I don't know if it gets -- -- opinion letters or -- or -- In any litigation, have they taken a different position? So you're asking us, assuming, just an assumption for the sake of argument, that we rule in your favor and say, as you've asked us to say, that a declaratory judgment is the -- that -- the only remedy available, and there is no Federal injunction that's possible here, do we vacate and remand for the court below to decide whether State law provides -- I'm sorry, so I say the statute says -- we say the statute says that. What are we doing? We're saying the State law is moot? If it's not preempted, how would it be mooted? But that begs the question on the question we're not looking at, but it begs the question on point 2 -- on the first point which is, is it a requirement that the biosimilar applicant give over the application. It is certainly a requirement of the statute, the remedy may be file a declaratory-judgment action. That goes back to preemption. How -- I'll phrase a -- I'll -- I'll put a question before you, okay? As I understand -- I got your position, which is that they have to give notice after the FDA approval, correct? Wouldn't that stop Phase 2 litigation from starting immediately? By your definition, they could go the biosimilar and the license -- -- product could go all through round 1. They've now narrowed their dispute. I thought round 2 involved disputes about other patents, not the ones that they narrowed. And so wouldn't your reading always force round 2 into the post-license 12-year period? I thought the whole purpose of the statute was to get round 1 and round 2 done and done before the 12-year period was finished. No, no, no. You still haven't answered my question. You're assuming -- you're assuming commercial launch has to be 12 years plus 6. I'm assuming that commercial launch should be 12 plus 1 -- -- because you only have an exclusive license for 12 years. That strengthens my argument. Because if the FDA is taking that position, then it's basically kicking off the possibility of round 2 pretty early. That -- that's -- no. It's not quite that. ""Shall"" is if you want to invoke this Federal process, this is what you have to do. All right? So if you don't invoke the Federal process, what remains? That's not a remedy. That's a different Federal process, the declaratory-judgment process. That's what (C) says. Under your reading, (B) and (C) become superfluous, because if you can get a State law information-exchange provision under (C) or -- or under State law, why give the remedy of starting a declaratory-judgment action at all? But that -- -- that -- really, the State law would end up, under your theory, forcing a biosimilar to invoke Phase I. Because at every stage, you -- where they choose to opt out, they -- you will just run to court and say, my State law remedy is force them to take the next step. Give me the application, then identify, then do this. You're going to -- there's no longer a choice. You're -- you're just -- all you're saying to me is that there's built-in incentives -- -- for the applicant to invoke and participate in phase 1. What you're not telling me is, it's no longer a choice -- -- because State law can force them -- -- through you seeking injunctions to participate unwillingly. I'm sorry, Mr. Waxman. Assume that there has been phase I, round one and round two before the approval. The district court has decided one of two things. There is a patent infringement. It's issued an injunction. The FDA has narrowed the scope of things substantially. If the applicant was seeking the world and the FDA is the one who narrowed it, why isn't it fair to the licensed product holder to let that injunction continue until there's now certainty that there isn't? If the -- if the patent infringement process ended up saying no infringement, district court agreed and there is no injunction, so these licensed products is going to deal with goods in the market, but they've gotten a shot at this, and the claims are now even more narrow. They lost on all the wider ones. I -- I'm not sure what unfairness there is to the license. If you -- if you go through the process the way it's anticipated. ",I be sorry could you clarify do that mean that the fda can not announce its intent to approve on year plus early than year or I be not quite sure i understand how long do it take for the fda to approve the biosimilar assume you go through phase i and there be and phase ii have be finish how long those run independent of the fda approval correct so how long i want you to go back to justice kennedy but i just want to get a sense of timing how long do it generally take for the fda to say this be okay effective plus no no I be try to get the process down it take them month let us assume you put in an application in year do they have to wait until when to announce that it be okay when do they tell you that they will can i go back to the beginning of justice breyer s question he make an assumption that until the approval of the product that the other side will not know exactly what it be that be go to be approve particularly in a situation like this where you you have keep your application from them so they do not have it take address that issue in your brief you say they can get it they can get it from the industry from the sec filing from from fda talk all of that stuff but that will not tell them exactly what it be that you be intend to market so or the other side how how would you know if you start a declaratory judgment action as you be entitle to do would not you know then could not you get it in discovery could it could the company with the product file a declaratory judgment action when they do not know what you be go to do do they have a good faith basis for believe you be go to infringe if they do not have the application to look at until they get discovery tell me how I be sorry if the biosimilar file a notice of intent to file the application and a copy of the application if it comply with all of the step in phase do it estop the bio the the licensed product holder from seek a declaratory judgment action well that be assume good faith and that be the next question which be if you if the biosimilar do not comply you be say the other side can sue but what happen if you do comply can the other side and the other side fail to they they do not give you the notice that they be require to they do not do something that be require on their part in that exchange process what be your biosimilars remedy in that case all incentive have a way of fail just look at our society so laughter mr yang do do we have your assurance that this be the fda s position have it be a consistent position in other situation i do not know if it get opinion letter or or in any litigation have they take a different position so you be ask us assume just an assumption for the sake of argument that we rule in your favor and say as you have ask us to say that a declaratory judgment be the that the only remedy available and there be no federal injunction that be possible here do we vacate and remand for the court below to decide whether state law provide I be sorry so i say the statute say we say the statute say that what be we do we be say the state law be moot if it be not preempt how would it be moot but that beg the question on the question we be not look at but it beg the question on point on the first point which be be it a requirement that the biosimilar applicant give over the application it be certainly a requirement of the statute the remedy may be file a declaratory judgment action that go back to preemption how I will phrase a I will I will put a question before you okay as i understand i get your position which be that they have to give notice after the fda approval correct would not that stop phase litigation from start immediately by your definition they could go the biosimilar and the license product could go all through round they have now narrow their dispute i think round involved dispute about other patent not the one that they narrow and so would not your reading always force round into the post license year period i think the whole purpose of the statute be to get round and round do and do before the year period be finish no no no you still have not answer my question you be assume you be assume commercial launch have to be year plus I be assume that commercial launch should be plus because you only have an exclusive license for year that strengthen my argument because if the fda be take that position then it be basically kick off the possibility of round pretty early that that be no it be not quite that shall be if you want to invoke this federal process this be what you have to do all right so if you do not invoke the federal process what remain that be not a remedy that be a different federal process the declaratory judgment process that be what c say under your reading b and c become superfluous because if you can get a state law information exchange provision under c or or under state law why give the remedy of start a declaratory judgment action at all but that that really the state law would end up under your theory force a biosimilar to invoke phase i because at every stage you where they choose to opt out they you will just run to court and say my state law

2016,Expressions Hair Design v. Schneiderman,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I'm sorry. I -- I -- you're two groups of -- of Petitioners. One wants to just give a cash price without any information about the surcharge, and the other, I thought, wanted to give two separate prices. So not everybody doesn't want to give truthful information about the surcharge. That's not what I understood, but your adversary can tell me. Counselor, can I -- I'm -- part of -- I'm a little bit like Justice Alito and less than Justice Kagan. I'm not sure what you or anybody is saying about this statute or what it means, but not because it's necessarily vague. I just don't see anything about speech in the statute. The statute simply says, ""No seller in any sales transaction may impose a surcharge on a holder who elects to use a credit card in lieu of payment by cash, check, or similar means."" To me, it's very simple: One price for everything. You walk in and -- forget about -- I don't know where they get the discount from or that the statute permits that, because what it says on its -- to me, on its plain terms is one price. And you told Justice Breyer that that was okay. Certainly would be -- I'm hard-pressed to see if that's the interpretation given to what I view as the plain meaning of the statute, that that would be unconstitutional. New York didn't. Well, this is a really nice agreement, except the State below had two different interpretations. And you tell me that that's what the State is going to tell me, that if they post credit card price 2.10, cash price $2, that if the cash -- if the person comes to the cashier and gives them a credit card, the cashier is going to say, you know you're paying a surcharge of 10 cents; you're going -- you're going to be prosecuted for that? So you think the Federal law was unconstitutional as well. Mr. Feigin, could you get more concrete for me? Take the list of four ways that they would like to advertise in the reply brief. Which ways do you think -- or would the New York law potentially or actually make any of this conduct illegal? Why? Fine. So look at this -- if that's what this law means, which of these four ways of advertising would be permissible and which would be unpermissible? 10 -- you would have to say $10.20. So that's regulating speech; it's not regulating price, because it's the same price whether -- I can do that math. Finish this -- all right. Is your answer to the reply brief examples the same as the solicitor general's office? And do you have a concern the way it does that the statute could be read more broadly? We're talking -- I can't look at this statute and rely on its words or make a judgment on its words because nothing of what you're saying it applies to is said on the face of this statute. You're asking me to take a lot of steps, which is start with the language of the statute, ignore it, and go to a Federal statute and apply its definitions. How many of them, you haven't quite told me. How you differ, you haven't quite told me. And -- but I'm going to assume the Federal definitions apply, even though none of them are used here. So I'm -- I'm very confused why you're starting your answer to Justice Breyer by saying, look at the statute and see what the words of the statute are doing. No, I don't, because I know I have to pay sales tax. And every -- and every State I have to figure out what that sales tax is and I've got to do the math in my own head. So they hold this in an as-applied a challenge -- I hope your adversary will confirm this -- that they want to do these four things that's in the reply brief, one or the other. If we say these are okay, whatever else the law means we're not reaching because this is an as-applied challenge. If -- if we say they're okay or the New York State court of appeals say it's okay, it's okay; right? But you're saying more than this. You're saying this is how they advertise it, but that there's a further disclosure law that when a customer calls up the gas station, the gas station can't do any one of these four things and potentially other things, too; right? I'm saying if we say it's okay. I know you're not claiming it is. I'm sorry. There is nothing about the scheme that addresses that. The scheme has no disclosure requirement of what was your actual credit card charge versus what you're charging. The scheme does nothing to help that situation.

2016,Fry v. Napoleon Community Schools,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Martinez, that begs the last question that was asked, which is the Payne -- you know the Ninth Circuit Payne decision. It doesn't do just that. It doesn't just look just at the relief. It looks at the nature of the claims and decides whether they are a fact claim or not, whether it is seeking a change in a FAPE or not, in essence in substance. So it's not looking at it technically as we are asking for relief. But it's -- it's looking at whether or not a FAPE claim is the substance of the allegation. You're disagreeing with the Ninth Circuit approach, presumably. No. What they -- what they are saying is, is the nature of the relief that they are asking for, would it require or necessitate a change in the fact? That's one of the three prongs that they look at. Yes, exactly. So let's go to the last argument -- the last question directly, then. Complaint says the FAPE was all wrong; it's hurt my child. And that's the nature of the complaint. The -- and it seeks injunctive relief for the future -- -- not to be hurt. All right. With no change of FAPE -- when -- no other thing is said? It's just, I want compensatory damages? How about no injunctive relief? Past and future damages for emotional distress? Can you tell us what page that's on? No, I know. The Respondents -- appellants -- What -- what allegation says they want reimbursement -- -- for her schooling, et cetera? When I look at the claimed harms, which the only allegations besides the prayer for relief at the end is in response -- Respondent's Appellate 11, 51A through F, every one of those harms alleged is a component of emotional harm. Nowhere are they saying she was harmed by having to pay for -- to pay for a tutoring program, or harmed by her mother losing her job, which is what your brief was talking about. Here, all of the harms alleged are essentially compensatory emotional harms: A, the denial of equal access; B, the denial of the use of Wonder; C, interference to form bonds with other kids; D, denial of an opportunity to interact with other children. And F says it very directly: emotional distress and pain, embarrassment, mental anguish, inconvenience, and loss of enjoyment. Those are -- every one of these are the classic damage harms that are compensatory. So how does the IDEA provide compensatory damages for these injuries? I know, but I was trying to look for it in the complaint, and I couldn't. Mr. Katyal, you're -- you're supposed to look at a complaint as a whole, okay, at the moment it's filed. What's clear in this complaint, because the allegations say it, this is what happened. It didn't have it in the IDEA. We asked them to do it; they didn't do it. They finally agreed to do it, and then we've placed our child in another school. They have a paragraph that says, She is now happily in another school that welcomes her and her dog. Okay? They then talk about all the emotional distress. At that moment, either because of futility, because she can't change the IDEA at a school she no longer attends, the school she is in is already giving her her dog, there is no declaratory relief being sought that her current IDEA is deficient -- forget about the past one -- is deficient. Why in the world, at the moment she filed the complaint, would she have to go back or should have gone to the school earlier? She no longer is seeking anything related to the IDEA facet. We are now getting -- we are now going past where I am, okay, or you're going behind what I'm saying but not getting to the point, Mr. Katyal. Maybe, before she changed schools, she might have been entitled to something related to her IDEA, but at the moment this complaint was filed, on its own face, where is it asking for any change, potentially or otherwise, to the IDEA that is no longer in effect? Would you fit into the Payne three criteria, the Ninth Circuit's three criteria? The Ninth Circuit uses to evaluate -- Mr. Katyal, my problem is, what were they -- is the only argument that you're making is that they are not entitled to their declaratory judgment because they didn't exhaust that? Are they entitled, whether they exhaust it or not, to the ADA claims for monetary compensatory damages for pain and suffering? Well, it's now -- it's now too late to exhaust, right? How about if they just waive all of that and say I want my money? I am -- I am so confused by your position. I'm -- I'm -- I'm so horribly confused. What is the purpose of all of this? Throw this case out now. Let them go back to school they are no longer in. They are going to say to the school, give me money, and what else? The school already admitted that. They let her bring the dog back in. She just said I don't -- I don't feel welcomed here and left. So they already got the relief they wanted. They got an admission by the school that she was entitled to bring the dog there. They have already said that. How about yours is an ideal situation. Conceded for the purposes you're arguing. But how about the mixed complaints, because that's what has been bothering my colleagues from the beginning. Okay? Let's assume that you had brought this case, not after you had moved her, but while she was still in the school. And you didn't say, as you conceded now, that you don't want the -- the FAPE changed. The complaint says they haven't let the service dog in. It's causing and has caused emotional distress. We want damages. It's not clear, but you do want the fact changed. What happens? I -- I just gave you a different hypothetical. Does the Court have the power to stay that until the IDEA claim is exhausted? The government appears to suggest that in their brief. I really -- I appreciate -- -- the nature of your case. All right? But your suggestion is likely to raise -- -- a lot of hesitation in this Court, amongst some, maybe even me. Because if what you're saying is we're going to be on a dual track in every case -- -- it's not going to be very attractive to the Court. ",mr martinez that beg the last question that be ask which be the payne you know the ninth circuit payne decision it do not do just that it do not just look just at the relief it look at the nature of the claim and decides whether they be a fact claim or not whether it be seek a change in a fape or not in essence in substance so it be not look at it technically as we be ask for relief but it be it be look at whether or not a fape claim be the substance of the allegation you be disagree with the ninth circuit approach presumably no what they what they be say be be the nature of the relief that they be ask for would it require or necessitate a change in the fact that be one of the three prong that they look at yes exactly so let us go to the last argument the last question directly then complaint say the fape be all wrong it be hurt my child and that be the nature of the complaint the and it seek injunctive relief for the future not to be hurt all right with no change of fape when no other thing be say it be just i want compensatory damage how about no injunctive relief past and future damage for emotional distress can you tell us what page that be on no i know the respondent appellant what what allegation say they want reimbursement for her schooling et cetera when i look at the claimed harm which the only allegation besides the prayer for relief at the end be in response respondent s appellate a through f every one of those harm allege be a component of emotional harm nowhere be they say she be harm by have to pay for to pay for a tutoring program or harm by her mother lose her job which be what your brief be talk about here all of the harm allege be essentially compensatory emotional harm a the denial of equal access b the denial of the use of wonder c interference to form bond with other kid d denial of an opportunity to interact with other child and f say it very directly emotional distress and pain embarrassment mental anguish inconvenience and loss of enjoyment those be every one of these be the classic damage harm that be compensatory so how do the idea provide compensatory damage for these injury i know but i be try to look for it in the complaint and i could not mr katyal you be you be suppose to look at a complaint as a whole okay at the moment it be file what be clear in this complaint because the allegation say it this be what happen it do not have it in the idea we ask them to do it they do not do it they finally agree to do it and then we have place our child in another school they have a paragraph that say she be now happily in another school that welcome her and her dog okay they then talk about all the emotional distress at that moment either because of futility because she can not change the idea at a school she no longer attend the school she be in be already give her her dog there be no declaratory relief be seek that her current idea be deficient forget about the past one be deficient why in the world at the moment she file the complaint would she have to go back or should have go to the school earlier she no longer be seek anything relate to the idea facet we be now get we be now go past where i be okay or you be go behind what I be say but not get to the point mr katyal maybe before she change school she might have be entitle to something related to her idea but at the moment this complaint be file on its own face where be it ask for any change potentially or otherwise to the idea that be no longer in effect would you fit into the payne three criterion the ninth circuit s three criterion the ninth circuit use to evaluate mr katyal my problem be what we be they be the only argument that you be make be that they be not entitle to their declaratory judgment because they do not exhaust that be they entitle whether they exhaust it or not to the ada claim for monetary compensatory damage for pain and suffering well it be now it be now too late to exhaust right how about if they just waive all of that and say i want my money i be i be so confused by your position I be I be I be so horribly confused what be the purpose of all of this throw this case out now let them go back to school they be no longer in they be go to say to the school give me money and what else the school already admit that they let her bring the dog back in she just say i do not i do not feel welcome here and leave so they already get the relief they want they get an admission by the school that she be entitle to bring the dog there they have already say that how about yours be an ideal situation concede for the purpose you be argue but how about the mixed complaint because that be what have be bother my colleague from the beginning okay let us assume that you have bring this case not after you have move her but while she be still in the school and you do not say as you concede now that you do not want the the fape change the complaint say they have not let the service dog in it have causing and have cause emotional distress we want damage it be not clear but you do want the fact change what happen i i just give you a different hypothetical do the court have the power to stay that until the idea claim be exhaust the government appear to suggest that in their brief i really i appreciate the nature of your case all right but your suggestion be likely to raise a lot of hesitation in this court amongst some maybe even me because if what you be say be we be go to be on a dual track in every case it be not go to be very attractive to the court ,450.46,Roberts Court,"Oct 31,

2016,Midland Funding v. Johnson,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I'm sorry. I'm having a great deal of difficulty with this business model. Completely. You buy old, old debts that you know for certainty are not within any statute of limitations. You buy them and you call up creditors and you say to them, you don't have to pay me. But out of the goodness of your heart, you should? Or do you just call them up and say, you owe me money, and you hope that they'll pay you. And is it the same thing in bankruptcy court? You filed a claim and you hope the trustee doesn't see that it's out of time? And apparently, you collect on millions of dollars of these debts. So is that what you do? Did you have a good-faith basis in this case to believe that the debt was not time-barred -- -- when you filed this claim? Forget about some of the others. Did you have a good-faith basis to believe the statute of limitations was not applicable? So what do you do with the committee notes that say that everyone who files a proof of claim has an obligation to do a good-faith inquiry as to whether it's an enforceable obligation or not? No, no. Not what they did; what they said. I agree with you. But if -- if that is true that you investigated and you had a good-faith basis for believing that it wasn't time-barred, you wouldn't be liable either under the bankruptcy rules or under these debtor rules. So -- but the point is if you were unaware and didn't properly investigate, have you fulfilled your obligations as a lawyer to the bankruptcy court? I'm sorry. I don't remember reading that in these. Could you give me a record cite for that? Or you can do it in your reply. Or -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm a little bit confused. The fact that the code anticipates that some people will file unenforceable claims even though they shouldn't, that that somehow proves that the code invites unenforceable claims? Contingent, unmatured, these are all words that suggest an entitlement to payment. Where in the definition any use of word -- of words talk about a claim that's unenforceable? A contingent claim may not be enforceable today, but it might be in the future. I'm sorry. What do you do with the language of Pennsylvania Public Welfare v. Davenport where we explicitly said that a claim is a right to payment and enforceable obligation? What do you do with that language? So it's a breach of the trustee's duties if he or she lets the claim go through without objecting? Well, that was Justice Kennedy's initial question. What would be the purpose of a trustee permitting a stale claim to go forward? Where -- where would that situation arise? The amount the creditor pays might be -- the debtor pays might be true, but every other creditor loses if an unenforceable debt is paid. So those situations don't account for the $800 million you've collected on these old claims. I'm sorry. You're taking up trustee time, which gets paid by the debtor ultimately and at administrative cost. You are taking up the time of other creditors, because there has to be, when an objection is raised, notice to all the creditors, a hearing date set, all of these procedural steps that are unnecessary because you have no basis to believe that this debt is enforceable. Counsel, I have been able to find only one judge who has been able to get around 911's limitation. 911 is the sanctioning power, right? You have to, like Rule 11, give notice to the other side that they're violating, right? And if they withdraw the claim at that point, there's no sanctions, right? There's only one judge I found in the bankruptcy context who has used his inherent powers. But that's a rare action where a judge resorts to inherent powers. This model -- this model is beautiful. You file a claim you know is old. If you get paid, wonderful. If somebody objects, you withdraw it. There's no sanction that's possible. And it just keeps on going. Why -- ",I be sorry I be have a great deal of difficulty with this business model completely you buy old old debt that you know for certainty be not within any statute of limitation you buy them and you call up creditor and you say to them you do not have to pay me but out of the goodness of your heart you should or do you just call them up and say you owe me money and you hope that they will pay you and be it the same thing in bankruptcy court you file a claim and you hope the trustee do not see that it be out of time and apparently you collect on million of dollar of these debt so be that what you do do you have a good faith basis in this case to believe that the debt be not time bar when you file this claim forget about some of the others do you have a good faith basis to believe the statute of limitation be not applicable so what do you do with the committee note that say that everyone who file a proof of claim have an obligation to do a good faith inquiry as to whether it be an enforceable obligation or not no no not what they do what they say i agree with you but if if that be true that you investigate and you have a good faith basis for believe that it be not time bar you would not be liable either under the bankruptcy rule or under these debtor rule so but the point be if you we be unaware and do not properly investigate have you fulfil your obligation as a lawyer to the bankruptcy court I be sorry i do not remember read that in these could you give me a record cite for that or you can do it in your reply or I be I be I be a little bit confused the fact that the code anticipate that some people will file unenforceable claim even though they should not that that somehow prove that the code invite unenforceable claim contingent unmatured these be all word that suggest an entitlement to payment where in the definition any use of word of word talk about a claim that be unenforceable a contingent claim may not be enforceable today but it might be in the future I be sorry what do you do with the language of pennsylvania public welfare v davenport where we explicitly say that a claim be a right to payment and enforceable obligation what do you do with that language so it be a breach of the trustee s duty if he or she let us the claim go through without object well that be justice kennedy s initial question what would be the purpose of a trustee permit a stale claim to go forward where where would that situation arise the amount the creditor pay might be the debtor pay might be true but every other creditor lose if an unenforceable debt be pay so those situation do not account for the million you have collect on these old claim I be sorry you be take up trustee time which get pay by the debtor ultimately and at administrative cost you be take up the time of other creditor because there have to be when an objection be raise notice to all the creditor a hearing date set all of these procedural step that be unnecessary because you have no basis to believe that this debt be enforceable counsel i have be able to find only one judge who have be able to get around s limitation be the sanction power right you have to like rule give notice to the other side that they be violate right and if they withdraw the claim at that point there be no sanction right there have only one judge i find in the bankruptcy context who have use his inherent power but that be a rare action where a judge resort to inherent power this model this model be beautiful you file a claim you know be old if you get pay wonderful if somebody object you withdraw it there be no sanction that be possible and it just keep on go why ,288.67000000000013,Roberts Court,"Jan 17, 2017","Midland Funding, LLC",Aleida Johnson,16-348,"Oct 11, 2016","May 15, 2017",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2016,Lee v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"What does rationality have to do with this, Mr. Bursch? We often get people who come in and say I wasn't told about a plea, and I would have pled guilty. And judges then look at the facts and find out that the defendant was claiming he was innocent, despite overwhelming evidence that he or she was guilty. Rock solid evidence. I mean, not only is there a video, there's witnesses, there's fingerprints, you name it, they're there, and defendants will come in and say I'm not guilty. And we say, you know, he's foolish, he's irrational. No rational human being would not take this plea, the difference between 50 years and five years, and yet, we deny their motion to undo their plea because we basically say it's subjective. This foolish defendant wanted to go to trial. I'm not quite sure what objectivity has to do with making a judgment whether this particular person, under their particular circumstances, would have or would not have gone to trial. Now, the factors you point to can support that subjective wish. If the difference between going to jail or not is only nine months, I might say: Hmm, hundred percent chance I'm going to be deported. And the only benefit I get is nine months in my plea, which is what happened here. And there's even a one percent chance that I might be found not guilty, or at least found guilty of possession and not something else. I think I'm going to roll the dice. It's not irrational. But I don't know whether -- There's always -- There's always -- there's always a set of degrees. I mean, whether or not we talk about this rational person would have accepted, how much of a defense and how viable is the defense? Would 1 percent defense versus 20 percent defense, 30 percent defense? At some point the district court is going to draw a rationality line that they think is reasonable, correct? So if -- if there -- if there's a defense that has a 1 percent chance, is that okay, versus one that has a 20 percent chance? Or how do you even measure how rational a potential defense may be -- -- if the inquiry is how much do we know he would or would not have taken this plea? There's no question -- I think the district court said here that this defendant would have gone to trial. And what they said was the absolute rule of this circuit is -- -- what led this district court judge to say I believe this person would have gone to trial, but this rule doesn't permit me to rule in his favor. I'm sorry -- I'm sorry -- What's the windfall? You're entitled to a constitutional trial. But putting that aside, you're not entitled to a plea. You're not entitled to a lesser sentence. You're entitled to go to jail if you want to. Isn't that what we said in Dominguez Benitez in a Rule 11 Strickland evaluation? We said that a court should, quote, ""Not second guess a defendant's actual decision if it is reasonably probable he would have gone to trial absent the error, it is no matter that the choice may have been foolish."" Now, that's Strickland under Rule 11, and it's the same inquiry. Would he have pled guilty if he had known this information? And we explicitly said your decision can be foolish. It's not an analogy. It talks about Strickland in the Rule 11 context. So here we have a defense attorney who says: I didn't know the law. I told him he wouldn't be deported. And if I had known the law, I would have told him to go to trial. So this is both prejudice in the advice and prejudice in the decision to go -- move forward. Or not move forward. Wait a minute. He has a constitutional right to effective counsel. And if he has that right, aren't we depriving him of that right and the right to a trial, both of them guaranteed by the Constitution -- as I keep saying, a plea is not -- to have his attorney try everything that is legally permissible to try? None of these attempts -- and your adversary went on for pages of the variety of different ways for him to have achieved a nondeportation plea as a possibility. Doesn't he have a right to have someone try that for him? Mr. Feigin, you know, we're talking about cases like this, the circuits are split. The vast majority of them do the reasonable probability test and don't seem to have the problems you're talking about. Do you know how many of these motions there are? There's not a whole -- I -- I mean, there's not a whole lot of them. There's a handful of them. The vast majority, the motion for relief are denied by the lower courts, not on the Sixth Circuit rule, but on the totality of the circumstances. It -- it doesn't appear as if we're overwhelmed with these. How many of them are being granted? Mr. Feigin -- Mr. Feigin, routinely papers come in from a Petitioner who says, my lawyer didn't do X. Most commonly, the lawyer comes in and says I did do X. And most commonly, the district court says the lawyer told me I did X, and at the pea -- plea colloquy I asked that question and the defendant said yes, I understood that consequence, and the court doesn't have a hearing. A ruling in our case wouldn't change those cases. It wouldn't change the cases where the defendant comes in and says I would have pled guilty, but the lawyer comes in and says he insisted he was innocent. I kept telling him the evidence was overwhelming, that he should take the plea, but he kept telling me I'm innocent. It doesn't require a hearing for a judge to say that defendant would not have pled guilty because he was claiming his innocence. Those cases wouldn't change either. Those are a good majority of the cases that come before district and circuit courts. Well, I still go back to -- to my earlier point, which is the difference between nine years and five and ten years is very big. For nine months and sure banishment? What's so irrational about going to trial? So what do we do -- what do we do with all those defendants who reject pleas with full knowledge and say a rational person must have wanted -- should have taken this case. And so you should vacate because I didn't take my plea. Don't look at all the facts and circumstances. Don't look at any of the arguments because it's only a rationality test. ",what do rationality have to do with this mr bursch we often get people who come in and say i be not tell about a plea and i would have plead guilty and judge then look at the fact and find out that the defendant be claim he be innocent despite overwhelming evidence that he or she be guilty rock solid evidence i mean not only be there a video there have witness there have fingerprint you name it

2016,"Water Splash, Inc. v. Menon",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, your adversary basically starts from the proposition that this text is unambiguous. Do you agree with that proposition? All right. So why do you think the drafters used those two different phrases? What's your best answer? The articles. What are the articles? No, what do they say? Where does the person get to raise the defense that they didn't actually receive notice? I -- I think that leading scholar -- maybe I'm wrong, but I thought I read it, thought that it -- that it may have been the scrivener's mistake, but the intent was clearly to effect service by the -- So this leading scholar calls it a misuse of words, but that the intent was clear in -- for all the reasons everyone else is giving? So why is this clear? Your adversary says isn't the lack of clarity inherent in the question; what do they mean by ""send""? They don't define ""send."" They don't define ""service."" So doesn't that automatically create an ambiguity? And why isn't the ambiguity approached the way the other side says? Well, I'm sorry. Did we give up or do you think they thought we were giving up the right to authorize States to permit service by mail? Or your position is -- is that we did; that in the treaty, we intended, by signing the treaty, to give up the power of States to authorize the service by mail? I'm asking you, do you think it's a fair reading of a treaty for us to read it to constrict the rights of States to effect service consistent with due process? Because there's no doubt that we consider mail service consistent with due process. The United States authorize it, right? All right. I -- I accept that. But many states permit service by mail, correct? I'm sorry. I thought -- I thought I had read this and I'm looking at it. The blue brief at page 9 says, ""Under Texas law, a plaintiff can serve a foreign defendant in several ways, including by certified mail return receipt requested, either by sending it to any defendant directly, or if certain conditions are met, by sending it to the Secretary of State, by complying with the provisions of any applicable treaty, and if certain other conditions are met by other court-ordered means."" So -- and there's a citation to the two sections of the Texas Civil Procedure Act. So it seems to me that Texas law, on its face, authorizes service by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by any other court-ordered means. So why was the service here ineffective under Texas law? Right. So why wasn't the service here pursuant to one of those authorized Texas ways? Mr. Gaston, would you start with the Brockmeyer question? Do you agree with the government on the issue that the treaty only permits, doesn't necessarily authorize? And then your adversary's position that the Texas court has already said that under Texas law, you can't serve this way. ",counsel your adversary basically start from the proposition that this text be unambiguous do you agree with that proposition all right so why do you think the drafter use those two different phrase what be your best answer the article what be the article no what do they say where do the person get to raise the defense that they do not actually receive notice i i think that lead scholar maybe I be wrong but i think i read it think that it that it may have be the scrivener s mistake but the intent be clearly to effect service by the so this lead scholar call it a misuse of word but that the intent be clear in for all the reason everyone else be give so why be this clear your adversary say be not the lack of clarity inherent in the question what do they mean by send they do not define send they do not define service so do not that automatically create an ambiguity and why be not the ambiguity approach the way the other side say well I be sorry do we give up or do you think they think we we be give up the right to authorize state to permit service by mail or your position be be that we do that in the treaty we intend by sign the treaty to give up the power of state to authorize the service by mail I be ask you do you think it be a fair reading of a treaty for us to read it to constrict the right of state to effect service consistent with due process because there be no doubt that we consider mail service consistent with due process the united state authorize it right all right i i accept that but many state permit service by mail correct I be sorry i think i think i have read this and I be look at it the blue brief at page say under texas law a plaintiff can serve a foreign defendant in several way include by certified mail return receipt request either by send it to any defendant directly or if certain condition be meet by send it to the secretary of state by comply with the provision of any applicable treaty and if certain other condition be meet by other court order mean so and there be a citation to the two section of the texas civil procedure act so it seem to me that texas law on its face authorizes service by certified mail return receipt request or by any other court order mean so why be the service here ineffective under texas law right so why be not the service here pursuant to one of those authorize texas way mr gaston would you start with the brockmeyer question do you agree with the government on the issue that the treaty only permit do not necessarily authorize and then your adversary s position that the texas court have already say that under texas law you can not serve this way ,220.84,Roberts Court,"Mar 22, 2017","Water Splash, Inc.",Tara Menon,16-254,"Feb 12, 2016","May 22, 2017",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2016,Hernandez v. Mesa,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Perhaps -- I'm sorry. Why not? If it's a State officer who lives in -- I guess this is Texas, right? Why couldn't the family sue that State officer under the theory that Justice Ginsburg raised, which is if all the acts happened in the United States, but were projected injuries into another State, most States -- I think including Texas, but I could be wrong -- we have counsel for -- for Officer Mesa to tell us -- the family could sue the State officer in Texas. He did the acts in Texas. He lives in Texas. Personal general jurisdiction. That's the first time ever. (Laughter.) He was riding a bike in the culvert there, correct? The wall is on one side, he's on the Mexico side of the wall in the culvert riding his bicycle. That's American territory? And so the dividing line is just the overpass pillar? Was the boy at that pillar? The boy was at the pillar or behind it? On the Mexican side. Why? They wouldn't get any damages for the death of their 15-year-old son for their emotional suffering. But I think I have, following up on what Justice Ginsburg is saying, a more fundamental question, which is I don't think you or the U.S. government is suggesting that anyone is condoning people standing at the border and taking potshots at passing Mexicans. All right. And, yes, there's a remedy -- criminal remedy for the government to vindicate its position, but why should there be -- not be a civil remedy to ensure that border police are complying with the Constitution? The entire -- either under the Fourth or Fifth Amendment? Wouldn't shooting potshots at Mexican citizens be shocking to the conscience? Can we -- -- go back to my hypothetical. Border policemen are shooting indiscriminately from within the United States across the border. This is the allegation in this complaint. And I understand you say the government has investigated and sees the facts differently. Have you seen the -- the film that appeared on the YouTube? I did, and I can't square the police officer's account of this incident with that film. That's fine. I'm just curious. ",perhaps I be sorry why not if it be a state officer who live in i guess this be texas right why could not the family sue that state officer under the theory that justice ginsburg raise which be if all the act happen in the united state but we be project injury into another state most state i think include texas but i could be wrong we have counsel for for officer mesa to tell us the family could sue the state officer in texas he do the act in texas he live in texas personal general jurisdiction that be the first time ever laughter he be rid a bike in the culvert there correct the wall be on one side he be on the mexico side of the wall in the culvert rid his bicycle that be american territory and so the dividing line be just the overpass pillar be the boy at that pillar the boy be at the pillar or behind it on the mexican side why they would not get any damage for the death of their year old son for their emotional suffering but i think i have follow up on what justice ginsburg be say a more fundamental question which be i do not think you or the us government be suggest that anyone be condone people stand at the border and take potshot at pass mexican all right and yes there be a remedy criminal remedy for the government to vindicate its position but why should there be not be a civil remedy to ensure that border police be comply with the constitution the entire either under the fourth or fifth amendment would not shoot potshot at mexican citizen be shock to the conscience can we go back to my hypothetical border policeman be shoot indiscriminately from within the united state across the border this be the allegation in this complaint and i understand you say the government have investigate and see the fact differently have you see the the film that appear on the youtube i do and i can not square the police officer s account of this incident with that film that be fine I be just curious ,170.57,Roberts Court,"Feb 21, 2017","Jesus C.

2016,Weaver v. Massachusetts,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Presumably, lawyers are members of the public. The judge is a member of the public. The bailiff is a member of the public. I'm presuming that once those jury members -- if they were given a choice, would not be there. (Laughter.) And so I think they have stopped being a member of the public as might be understood with respect to access. I think one thinks of members of the public as anyone who might be interested, but not compelled to be in attendance. All right. So I think what Presley said, if I'm not mistaken, is that you can't keep out interested people just because of overcrowding. Could -- could I ask you, though, there is a big difference between the absence of an attorney at trial or a conflict of interest. In both those situations, there's not a possibility of waiver or forfeiture -- the -- knowing waiver or forfeiture because a conflicted counsel has failed to tell someone a truth that they're conflicted and gotten themselves off the case. Absence of counsel is the very essence of the violation. The defendant doesn't know enough to object. But here there are serious questions about waiver and forfeiture. It's -- why wouldn't it be in the best interest of every attorney to say, I didn't know that a closure was a constitutional violation, the way this gentleman did? Isn't that -- No. In every circumstance. In -- in virtually every circumstance, the lawyer knows there's been a closure. There's been plain error in his failure -- his or her failure to object. So how does the judge determine whether that waiver or forfeiture should or should not be held against the defendant? It's available. The question is, wouldn't the judge be doing exactly what's happening here? Wouldn't the judge, under the fourth prong, look at what actually happens, whether the closure was complete, part of the trial, was there a transcript of the voir dire -- -- so that they could measure the possible effects or not, and end up saying that the substantial integrity of the proceedings haven't been violated? Do you think that, as a matter of law, we could overrule a finding of that nature, if it was in direct review under plain error? Oh, that's not the -- the lessons of our case law. I think reverse is true of our case law. All right. So the rule that you're asking us to adopt today, Cronic said an absolute absence of counsel, you presume prejudice. We have further said that a conflict of interest, actual conflict of interest, you can presume prejudice. Would an absolute closure, improper closure of a courtroom for no reason, could we presume prejudice there, or would you require the proof of actual prejudice the way you're advocating here? What's wrong -- wouldn't it be logical to say that there are -- that structural errors on the reliability of a trial are affected by the quality of the violation? A partial closure, improper as it may be, is not the same as a total closure. And in a total situation, the reliability of the trial is put into question in a such a fundamental way that prejudice can be presumed. Otherwise, we're never going to make any meaning of structural error. ",presumably lawyer be member of the public the judge be a member of the public the bailiff be a member of the public I be presume that once those jury member if they we be give a choice would not be there laughter and so i think they have stop be a member of the public as might be understood with respect to access i think one think of member of the public as anyone who might be interested but not compel to be in attendance all right so i think what presley say if I be not mistake be that you can not keep out interested people just because of overcrowding could could i ask you though there be a big difference between the absence of an attorney at trial or a conflict of interest in both those situation there be not a possibility of waiver or forfeiture the knowing waiver or forfeiture because a conflicted counsel have fail to tell someone a truth that they be conflict and get themselves off the case absence of counsel be the very essence of the violation the defendant do not know enough to object but here there be serious question about waiver and forfeiture it be why would not it be in the best interest of every attorney to say i do not know that a closure be a constitutional violation the way this gentleman do be not that no in every circumstance in in virtually every circumstance the lawyer know there be be a closure there have be plain error in his failure his or her failure to object so how do the judge determine whether that waiver or forfeiture should or should not be hold against the defendant it be available the question be would not the judge be do exactly what be happen here would not the judge under the fourth prong look at what actually happen whether the closure be complete part of the trial be there a transcript of the voir dire so that they could measure the possible effect or not and end up say that the substantial integrity of the proceeding have not be violate do you think that as a matter of law we could overrule a finding of that nature if it be in direct review under plain error oh that be not the the lesson of our case law i think reverse be true of our case law all right so the rule that you be ask us to adopt today cronic say an absolute absence of counsel you presume prejudice we have further say that a conflict of interest actual conflict of interest you can presume prejudice would an absolute closure improper closure of a courtroom for no reason could we presume prejudice there or would you require the proof of actual prejudice the way you be advocate here what be wrong would not it be logical to say that there be that structural error on the reliability of a trial be affect by the quality of the violation a partial closure improper as it may be be not the same as a total closure and in a total situation the reliability of the trial be put into question in a such a fundamental way that prejudice can be presume otherwise we be never go to make any meaning of structural error ,242.09,Roberts Court,"Apr 19, 2017",Kentel Myrone Weave,Commonwealth of Massachusetts,16-240,"Jan 13, 2017","Jun 22, 2017",113.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2016,Goodyear Tire v. Haeger,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"How do you -- am I to take that your -- I think what I read from your brief is that we should draw the line that we drew in Bagli between compensatory damages under the contempt inherent power and punishment damages that require criminal civil procedures. Is that the same thing you're asking us to -- So how do you deal with Chambers? That's always a guess-estimate to start with. Guess-estimate, I use it in its colloquial sense of you're -- you're looking at what happened and you're cutting broadly at the lines because you can never set the line precisely. But as Justice -- as the Chief Justice said on the Heat Rise test, there was one expert that was questioned, but would have been questioned in a totally different way if the proper tests had been disclosed. Why was that causal decision by the district court wrong? No, but they -- they -- the district court asked you to tell them what you thought wasn't caused, assuming that you accepted the district court's findings. Am I to understand the question presented -- as presented was whether there is a direct causation standard applicable to an award under a court's inherent powers. And you're now saying we wanted a but-for incremental cost analysis to define direct cause. Then ask your adversary how he would define it if it was going to be applied. But you're also asking us to actually apply it in your case. And to review the district court's findings de novo or on abuse of discretion? When you gave this figure to the district court you said, in your submission, ""Goodyear reviewed plaintiffs' billing entries and created a category of cost."" I'm quoting you. ""Unrelated to the alleged harm and outside the scope of the court's order."" So if that was your definition of what was unrelated to the harm, what's left for the district court to do? Did the other defendants contribute to the settlement that was ultimately reached? Could you describe for me your definition of direct causation or causation? Give me a definition. How is it different than Fox, than the definition and the words Fox used? Assuming the bad faith that the district court found -- not making a judgment, because that hasn't been proffered before us. But if, in fact, you were subjected to the bad faith the Court found, then sending it back just costs you more money; right? There is something -- I -- I do understand that. But one argument they have made that -- that I had not thought of the case in, Justice Breyer said, we don't know what would have happened. That's what the district court said. Could have settled right away. It could have gone to trial for more money. His argument that -- which he was really saying was this was a sham litigation, because with the proper information, everything related to your client, at least, would not have happened the way it did. Things would have been a very different litigation. From that moment on, whether through settlement or not, you wasted their time and the court's time, because everything was infected by the failure to give the Heat Rise test. Why isn't that put forth, if you -- He used the analogy of you derailed the train to take another route it didn't have to travel. So why isn't the travel on that route compensable? ",how do you be i to take that your i think what i read from your brief be that we should draw the line that we draw in bagli between compensatory damage under the contempt inherent power and punishment damage that require criminal civil procedure be that the same thing you be ask us to so how do you deal with chamber that be always a guess estimate to start with guess estimate i use it in its colloquial sense of you be you be look at what happen and you be cut broadly at the line because you can never set the line precisely but as justice as the chief justice say on the heat rise test there be one expert that be question but would have be question in a totally different way if the proper test have be disclose why be that causal decision by the district court wrong no but they they the district court ask you to tell them what you think be not cause assume that you accept the district court s finding be i to understand the question present as present be whether there be a direct causation standard applicable to an award under a court s inherent power and you be now say we want a but for incremental cost analysis to define direct because then ask your adversary how he would define it if it be go to be apply but you be also ask us to actually apply it in your case and to review the district court s finding de novo or on abuse of discretion when you give this figure to the district court you say in your submission goodyear review plaintiff billing entry and create a category of cost I be quote you unrelated to the allege harm and outside the scope of the court s order so if that be your definition of what be unrelated to the harm what be leave for the district court to do do the other defendant contribute to the settlement that be ultimately reach could you describe for me your definition of direct causation or causation give me a definition how be it different than fox than the definition and the word fox use assume the bad faith that the district court find not make a judgment because that have not be proffer before us but if in fact you we be subject to the bad faith the court find then send it back just cost you more money right there be something i i do understand that but one argument they have make that that i have not think of the case in justice breyer say we do not know what would have happen that be what the district court say could have settle right away it could have go to trial for more money his argument that which he be really say be this be a sham litigation because with the proper information everything relate to your client at least would not have happen the way it do thing would have be a very different litigation from that moment on whether through settlement or not you waste their time and the court s time because everything be infect by the failure to give the heat rise test why be not that put forth if you he use the analogy of you derail the train to take another route it do not have to travel so why be not the travel on that route compensable ,255.92,Roberts Court,"Jan 10, 2017",Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company,"Leroy Haeger, et al.",15-1406,"Sep 29, 2016","Apr 18, 2017",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2016,Kindred Nursing Centers Limited Partnership v. Clark,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"So how about a different example, but more related in my mind right now. Under Kentucky law, let's say, the power of attorney requirements are strictly construed. That was one of the principles that the court below used to interpret at least one of the contracts. And as a general matter, it states that the State requires express consent to confer power to waive any fundamental constitutional right. Would this general principle be preempted by the FFA -- by the FAA? Mr. -- Following up on Justice Alito's question, and I know Ping is not before us, but applying your arguments to Ping, because the author of Ping dissented in these two cases, do you think Ping is closer to the neutral application of a contract interpretation? I see -- No, no. I was going to say, Wellner is a little closer. But it seems to me that -- That's a pretty powerful -- That's a pretty weak argument that they've automatically made a special rule for arbitration. They looked at, will the institute settle and conduct litigation with no mention of alternative dispute resolution and conveying personal property, not necessarily contracting. There wasn't a general contracting clause. So I think there's arguments on both sides of that question. If there is, what do you suggest we do?

2016,County of Los Angeles v. Mendez,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"You know, I have a -- it is a very moving statement, and one that I totally agree with, but we're not asking the police officers to make that choice. When they feel in danger, they are going to take the step that's important to them, and I think that's absolutely right. The issue is who's going to suffer that loss? Who's going to take the financial penalty of that loss, not that that's the -- the death of the officer. And so the question to me is not that one. The question is when does the police officer pay the victim who is suffering for that loss if the victim had nothing to do with causing the loss? Or -- or was justified in whatever he or she did to protect themselves. So let's take the situation, which I think you concede in your brief, that of the police officer who, in the dead of night, in -- dressed in casual clothes, breaks a window in someone's home and walks into their home. And we have given them the Second Amendment right to victims, people who own homes, to possess firearms to protect themselves. And the victim sees a stranger breaking in who doesn't announce themselves, doesn't have a uniform, and is standing there breaking in. The victim shoots that police officer, or points a gun at that police officer, and the police officer takes a gun and shoots them and injures them or kills them. Now who bears the financial loss in that situation? The homeowner, who has a right to defend him or herself and say it's my life or yours, or the police officer who has taken unreasonable action in breaking into a home in the middle of the night without announcing him or herself? That's the question for me. Well, let's -- let's break that down, because I see two scenarios in this for which a victim could -- could recover. One is an unconstitutional violation that proximately causes an injury. Okay? That's the theory you come to. And the second is, if there was an unreasonable use of force by the police officer. You're taking out of the equation the second way of -- of recovering? That's where I have -- ' I'm sorry. Go ahead. So, why is it that every Graham case we look at, all the car chase cases, every single one of them, we -- when we're talking about the situation facing the officer, we look at everything the officer and the victim did that led up to the moment of confrontation. Because all of the facts that you point to as the police officer's knowledge of the victim are facts that usually are intertwined with what led up to the incident. So if you look at a car chase, you're looking at a person who, over an extended period of time has driven a car crazily, has put other people at risk, has swerved and missed other cars, done a series of things that the officer is aware of because he participated in the chase, and at the moment that he is looking at what the victim -- what the defendant is doing, he's saying he drove the car and almost hit another car, he's pointing the car at me, he's going to hit me. And -- but you're looking at both sides of that equation. You're not ratcheting it up on one side. But why isn't -- -- how they do their job, because they have to know -- they have to know what reasonable people will do. I mean, if -- if a 1983 claim is a tort claim, and if they jump in front of a car, of a total stranger on the street, and the person is coming at them, should that person behind the wheel bear the brunt of an injury because the police officer says the car was coming towards me, so to save myself, I pulled the gun and shot them, even though this is Joe Blow who's never been arrested, doesn't own a gun, never knew the officer had jumped into the street? If a normal person did that, they'd pay for that victim's injury. Why does a police officer get a pass on that? So is it -- -- for a police officer to pull a gun and shoot a driver that has no guilt associated with him or her? Not an armed felon, just a normal person to stumble into the street and say, I'm a police officer, I'm going to seize that person and stop myself by being injured by shooting that person? Can you repeat that standard? You're making a presumption there that I think you have to address, which is, yes, they entered without a warrant. You're assuming it's unconstitutional. No one's addressed it, and I don't think the Court did below, whether that entry had an exception for unconstitutionality. Was it an exigent circumstance or not? You're assuming that they didn't have a legal motive for entry. I'm willing to start with that assumption, but let's assume that a court below could say that the entry was lawful because it was pursuant to exigent circumstances. What would happen to your argument then? So we're assuming that the entry was unlawful. There were no exceptions to it in this case. Let's go to that superseding cause document. Earlier you said to Justice Alito that if a police officer unlawfully enters your home, announces him or herself, shows you a badge, and you pull out a gun and point it at him or her, that that officer would not be liable for shooting you because, presumably, that person, knowing that you're a police officer, if they pull a gun on you, they are responsible for the consequences, correct? All right. So what's the difference between that scenario and this one? Why aren't -- why isn't Mr. Mendez's -- I don't think there's a dispute that he was moving the gun not because he heard the police officers, but he just wanted to get it out of the way -- that there was no intent on his part? What -- why isn't it just like the other person who points the gun at someone? This is standard tort law, right? Wait a minute. This wasn't in the middle of the day. 1 p.m. in the afternoon? ",you know i have a it be a very moving statement and one that i totally agree with but we be not ask the police officer to make that choice when they feel in danger they be go to take the step that be important to them and i think that be absolutely right the issue be who be go to suffer that loss who be go to take the financial penalty of that loss not that that be the the death of the officer and so the question to me be not that one the question be when do the police officer pay the victim who be suffer for that loss if the victim have nothing to do with cause the loss or or be justify in whatever he or she do to protect themselves so let us take the situation which i think you concede in your brief that of the police officer who in the dead of night in dress in casual clothes break a

officer who have take unreasonable action in break into a home in the middle of the night without announce him or herself that be the question for me well let us let us break that down because i see

injure by shoot that person can you repeat that standard you be make a presumption there that i think you have to address which be yes they enter without a warrant you be assume it be unconstitutional

2016,Kokesh v. SEC,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counselor, before the 1970s -- and you haven't shown me anything to the contrary -- forfeiture was an in rem proceeding where the property was attached; the money, the bank account, a piece of property, a home, whatever, but it was not a personal action against an individual. So how do we get from that traditional understanding which governed this statute to your meaning today? Because there is a vast difference between in rem and in personam actions. A fine has -- I mean, forfeit -- disgorgement is an equitable remedy on getting back money that doesn't belong to you. A fine is a payment in addition to the conduct that you committed. So there is a difference there. That begs the question. Can we go back to the authority? 78u, which is the only authority I can imagine, says, ""A court may grant any equitable relief that may be appropriate or necessary for the benefit of investors."" If they are not doing -- if they're not doing restitution, how could that be the basis of disgorgement? Well, I'll let your adversary tell me what the source of their power is, but I -- I -- it is unusual. Would you tell me why you think this is punitive? What are your best arguments? I've read your brief, but the government responded to some of them in -- in, well, somewhat persuasive ways. So what do you think remains as your strongest argument as to why it's punitive and not restorative? But that's every -- restitution is that way, and you don't think of restitution as punitive. It's a question I'm going to ask your adversary, but what do you see as the difference between -- besides the statute of limitations, what's the difference between restitution and disgorgement? What's the name of that case? Well, I don't know why that proves anything. If I commit a crime and take my proceeds and give half of it to Justice Breyer -- (Laughter.) I don't know what I was buying, but I bought something. I got the benefit just because I was able to direct it. So I don't know that that moves me. It gets more complicated than that, because the money goes to the court -- -- according to the government, and it's the court that decides how the money will be paid out, correct? And then the question becomes what you answered earlier, which is, if it's being paid to the victim, is it really restitution as opposed to disgorgement. And if it's restitution, is it compensatory damages subject to the existing statute of limitations. Could Congress pass a statute giving the SEC the authority to bring these actions for however long a period Congress chooses? Right. So -- So what is the difference from restitution? Why isn't this restitution? So if this is the houseboat, why don't we call this restitution? Now, in forfeiture, you're tracing in some metaphysical way a pot that has been wrongfully taken. And you are in traditional forfeiture saying, give back that pot. In this situation, we're not asking for that pot. We don't care where the money comes from. We're saying you're liable for a fixed money judgment that you're going to give up. So how is that not the same as a penalty? Because a penalty is saying to someone, you've committed a wrong. We don't care what you did with that pot that you got. We're not asking you in a traditional forfeiture sense to turn that pot over. We're asking you to give money from whatever sources you may have, other sources, and pay for the wrong that you did. So isn't it analytically more like a penalty than it is like making someone whole? I think making someone whole is a forfeiture. Give up the illegal gains you got. Doesn't matter. The question -- -- is -- -- if it looks like a forfeiture, why don't we treat it like a forfeiture? ",counselor before the s and you have not show me anything to the contrary forfeiture be an in rem proceeding where the property be attach the money the bank account a piece of property a home whatever but it be not a personal action against an individual so how do we get from that traditional understanding which govern this statute to your mean today because there be a vast difference between in rem and in personam action a fine have i mean forfeit disgorgement be an equitable remedy on get back money that do not belong to you a fine be a payment in addition to the conduct that you commit so there be a difference there that beg the question can we go back to the authority u which be the only authority i can imagine say a court may grant any equitable relief that may be appropriate or necessary for the benefit of investor if they be not do if they be not do restitution how could that be the basis of disgorgement well I will let your adversary tell me what the source of their power be but i i it be unusual would you tell me why you think this be punitive what be your best argument I have read your brief but the government respond to some of them in in well somewhat persuasive way so what do you think remain as your strong argument as to why it be punitive and not restorative but that be every restitution be that way and you do not think of restitution as punitive it be a question I be go to ask your adversary but what do you see as the difference between besides the statute of limitation what be the difference between restitution and disgorgement what be the name of that case well i do not know why that prove anything if i commit a crime and take my proceeds and give half of it to justice breyer laughter i do not know what i be buy but i buy something i get the benefit just because i be able to direct it so i do not know that that move me it get more complicated than that because the money go to the court accord to the government and it be the court that decide how the money will be pay out correct and then the question become what you answer early which be if it be be pay to the victim be it really restitution as oppose to disgorgement and if it be restitution be it compensatory damage subject to the exist statute of limitation could congress pass a statute give the sec the authority to bring these action for however long a period congress chooses right so so what be the difference from restitution why be not this restitution so if this be the houseboat why do not we call this restitution now in forfeiture you be trace in some metaphysical way a pot that have be wrongfully take and you be in traditional forfeiture say give back that pot in this situation we be not ask for that pot we do not care where the money come from we be say you be liable for a fixed money judgment that you be go to give up so how be that not the same as a penalty because a penalty be say to someone you have commit a wrong we do not care what you do with that pot that you get we be not ask you in a traditional forfeiture sense to turn that pot over we be ask you to give money from whatever source you may have other source and pay for the wrong that you do so be not it analytically more like a penalty than it be like make someone whole i think make someone whole be a forfeiture give up the illegal gain you get do not matter the question be if it look like a forfeiture why do not we treat it like a forfeiture ,264.2,Roberts Court,"Apr 18, 2017",Charles R.

2016,Advocate Health Care Network v. Stapleton,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Why? There was a provision that was proposed that would have done very clearly what you think this provision does now. And Congress didn't pass it. So an earlier version did exactly what you wanted. It said you can -- a plan that establishes and/or maintained by a church. The pension plans. A plan established and maintained by a church includes a plan established and maintained by a church-affiliated organization. Who? I'm sorry. A plan established and maintained by a church, so that's any plan established by -- this is the old language, by the way, so -- But that's any church plan. Plus it defined includes a plan established and maintained by a church-affiliated organization. Why is not a pension plan? A plan established and maintained by a church-affiliated organization. So -- Ms. Blatt, I -- putting aside that purpose, do you think Congress had in mind a -- corporations that are essentially like every other corporation except they're not for profit? I mean, these hospitals, some of them, like Dignity, the Catholic church has disavowed any formal affiliation with it. Is that -- is that -- do you think that -- I understand the nuns, but you're talking now about an extreme. The nuns may have, but they're -- no longer are affiliated with the church. I'm not going to fight over -- -- that. I -- but let's go back to my basic question. They're not doing anything different than any other hospital. Or -- or -- or care center. They are competing. They're the fifth largest healthcare provider in the nation. They have 60,000 employees. Do you believe that Congress's vision was to let, what is essentially, a corporate entity opt out of protecting all of those employees? Mr. Feldman, I have a starting question, which is I'm torn. This could be read either way in my mind. If I believe that, what do I go to, to break the tie? Mr. Feldman -- Let's go to that 1982. Tell me how your reading of the statute includes the organizations that were clamoring and for whom the IRS had said were covered by this provision: The pension boards that were separate from the church, and Ms. Blatt pointed to the sisters, the nuns, who were also seeking coverage. How does your reading take care of those two situations facing Congress? Mr. Feldman, why do you think -- I mean, I've -- I have read all your arguments about why the IRS letters are not entitled to deference. But I come at it from a different point, which is it was in part these private organizations, religious organizations, but the IRS, too, who was lobbying Congress to express itself on this issue and take care of what the IRS knew was a problem for all these people. And then all of a sudden, almost immediately after the legislation is passed, the IRS is believing and stating that it's done more than you claim. Isn't that, in itself, evidence -- not the Skidmore deference -- but evidence that the agency believed that the answer was different than you're promoting right now? Except they knew there was a problem. They thought or they assumed -- Rightly or wrongly, they assumed that this language fixed it and fixed it how they were describing it in these letters. ",why there be a provision that be propose that would have do very clearly what you think this provision do now and congress do not pass it so an early version do exactly what you want it say you can a plan that establish andor maintain by a church the pension plan a plan establish and maintain by a church include a plan establish and maintain by a church affiliated organization who I be sorry a plan establish and maintain by a church so that be any plan establish by this be the old language by the way so but that be any church plan plus it define include a plan establish and maintain by a church affiliated organization why be not a pension plan a plan establish and maintain by a church affiliated organization so ms blatt i put aside that purpose do you think congress have in mind a corporation that be essentially like every other corporation except they be not for profit i mean these hospital some of them like dignity the catholic church have disavow any formal affiliation with it be that be that do you think that i understand the nun but you be talk now about an extreme the nun may have but they be no long be affiliate with the church I be not go to fight over that i but let us go back to my basic question they be not do anything different than any other hospital or or or care center they be compete they be the fifth large healthcare provider in the nation they have employee do you believe that congress s vision be to let what be essentially a corporate entity opt out of protect all of those employee mr feldman i have a starting question which be I be torn this could be read either way in my mind if i believe that what do i go to to break the tie mr feldman let us go to that tell me how your reading of the statute include the organization that we be clamor and for whom the irs have say we be cover by this provision the pension board that we be separate from the church and ms blatt point to the sister the nun who we be also seek coverage how do your read take care of those two situation face congress mr feldman why do you think i mean I have i have read all your argument about why the irs letter be not entitle to deference but i come at it from a different point which be it be in part these private organization religious organization but the irs too who be lobby congress to express itself on this issue and take care of what the irs knew be a problem for all these people and then all of a sudden almost immediately after the legislation be pass the irs be believe and state that it be do more than you claim be not that in itself evidence not the skidmore deference but evidence that the agency believe that the answer be different than you be promote right now except they know there be a problem they think or they assume rightly or wrongly they assume that this language fix it and fix it how they we be describe it in these letter ,253.57,Roberts Court,"Mar 27, 2017","Advocate Health Care Network, et al.","Maria Stapleton, et al.",16-74,"Dec 2, 2016","Jun 5, 2017",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

2016,Dean v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, during the time the guidelines were mandatory, but afterwards, many, many court of appeals basically told district courts you can't impose a sentence simply because you disagree with the guideline. You can impose it for independent reasons to ensure a just result, but you can't impose it merely because you don't like the guideline. And they monitored that pretty well. That's basically what -- this district court didn't say it didn't like the mandatory minimum. It said instead that it thought a fair sentence was, and that -- that would have been one day, if it could have done it, given that the rest of the sentence, 30 years, was even further beyond what the judge thought was adequate for punishment, deterrence, and all the other factors under 3553, correct? So it's not negating Congress's purpose if a district court gives one day; correct? And one day is a day of punishment, isn't it? Isn't that your point? This is the -- A circuit court's ruling -- there's at least one, the Tenth, that had ruled in your favor. Had it done so by the time 924(c) was amended? Postdated or predated the changes in 924 -- How old was your defendant? Do you know? So he would be 50-odd something? Now, in terms of that analytical difficulty, there is inherent in this scheme a bit of double -- a lot of double counting, because the substantive crimes almost always, in trying to judge the severity of punishment for that, you're always thinking of the gun, and -- and that always adds to whatever analytically separate punishment you think should be given for the substantive crime. So there is a little bit of twisting of a judge by saying you have to somehow put yourself in the position of punishing this person without knowing that he's going to be punished for the gun anyway for 30 years, and think of what the punishment should be without that punishment. Because the gun is present in both crimes, correct? The identity theft add-ons, one is -- for every crime except terrorism is only two years, correct? And in many ways it's punishing for a separate activity than merely the possession of identity theft items. Exactly. So the five years is for the terrorism. Mr. Yang -- -- I mean, the lack of beauty of the guidelines is they're so artificial on so many levels; all right? What differentiates a normal theft from a robbery is the use of force. And the guidelines, in defining the guidelines range for a theft, starts at a much, much lower base level. Starts at a seven, okay? For a robbery, it starts at a base level of 20. Once you start with that huge difference between the use of force and the nonuse of force, obviously, the robbery guideline is always going to include the use of force. The fact that it might be with a gun as opposed to a knife as opposed to a threat of violence or whatever else you want to define it, the use of force is inherent already in the guideline calculation because, otherwise, that -- there's no reason. They could have just had one table and said, if you rob someone, if it was a pure calculation, as you suggest it, without thinking about the gun, it would have been $20,000 is taken, we're all going to start at a offense level of five years and build up from there. That's not what the guidelines do. So when you're taking discretion away from a judge, I think that's one of the reasons we often require specificity, because the guidelines are artificial in so many different ways. And there are gyrations that we go through as judges to comply with dictates that are not very often very clear. ",counsel during the time the guideline we be mandatory but afterwards many many court of appeal basically tell district court you can not impose a sentence simply because you disagree with the guideline you can impose it for independent reason to ensure a just result but you can not impose it merely because you do not like the guideline and they monitor that pretty well that be basically what this district court do not say it do not like the mandatory minimum it say instead that it think a fair sentence be and that that would have be one day if it could have do it give that the rest of the sentence year be even further beyond what the judge thought be adequate for punishment deterrence and all the other factor under correct so it be not negating congress s purpose if a district court give one day correct and one day be a day of punishment be not it be not that your point this be the a circuit court s ruling there be at least one the tenth that have rule in your favor have it do so by the time c be amend postdate or predate the change in how old be your defendant do you know so he would be odd something now in term of that analytical difficulty there be inherent in this scheme a bit of double a lot of double counting because the substantive crime almost always in try to judge the severity of punishment for that you be always think of the gun and and that always add to whatever analytically separate punishment you think should be give for the substantive crime so there be a little bit of twisting of a judge by say you have to somehow put yourself in the position of punish this person without know that he be go to be punish for the gun anyway for year and think of what the punishment should be without that punishment because the gun be present in both crime correct the identity theft add ons one be for every crime except terrorism be only two year correct and in many way it be punish for a separate activity than merely the possession of identity theft item exactly so the five year be for the terrorism mr yang i mean the lack of beauty of the guideline be they be so artificial on so many level all right what differentiate a normal theft from a robbery be the use of force and the guideline in define the guideline range for a theft start at a much much low base level start at a seven okay for a robbery it start at a base level of once you start with that huge difference between the use of force and the nonuse of force obviously the robbery guideline be always go to include the use of force the fact that it might be with a gun as oppose to a knife as oppose to a threat of violence or whatever else you want to define it the use of force be inherent already in the guideline calculation because otherwise that there be no reason they could have just have one table and say if you rob someone if it be a pure calculation as you suggest it without think about the gun it would have be be take we be all go to start at a offense level of five year and build up from there that be not what the guideline do so when you be take discretion away from a judge i think that be one of the reason we often require specificity because the guideline be artificial in so many different way and there be gyration that we go through as judge to comply with dictate that be not very often very clear ,272.27000000000004,Roberts Court,"Feb 28, 2017","Levon Dean, Jr.",United States,15-9260,"Oct 28, 2016","Apr 3, 2017",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2016,Microsoft v. Baker,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Fisher, you've been arguing this in the alternative, but what do you think is the critical fact for you?

What's your best argument and what's your best critical fact that defines the outcome in this case? Does that mean -- -- that there's no -- I mean, I personally don't like absolutes. And so I haven't been able to imagine a situation in which a case is dismissed with prejudice, but where there may be some issues that should survive.

2016,Shaw v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I'm sorry. Possessory right means I own something. I'm holding it. In most criminal charges for larceny, the issue is whether I have a possessory right, regardless of what I want to do with this property, over you who's taken it from me. So where do you get the next step that possessory right means I have to lose something of value or that I'm going to ultimately bear the loss? Isn't the loss merely the loss of the possessory right? My colleague Justice Alito has written extensively on this issue of intent versus knowledge. All right. Why don't we just, instead of using intent -- All right. You can deceive someone without taking property, right? All right. Someone can open up an account in a false name. They've deceived the bank, but it's not to cheat the bank of anything its holding. But it's to the cheat the wife who he wants to hide money from, right? So nothing of value has been taken. You can cheat the bank in that way, too, out of moving something somewhere, but not to take it. Okay? And you can deprive someone of property without deceiving or cheating them. You can rob them, right? All right. So I thought -- and this is what Justice Kagan was getting to -- it has to be that you deceive or cheat and deprive someone of property, correct? Of defrauding. You -- you defraud someone by deception. That's why you say it's two different elements. So far, I perfectly understand your point. That the defraud element has two prongs to it; deception, for the lack of -- deception is one prong and deprivation is the other. You're taking the money by -- or the possessory interest by deception. And you're saying that by using the disjunctive, the ""or,"" the jury could have convicted merely for deceiving the bank, but didn't find that they deceived ""and"" deprived the bank of a possessory interest, correct? Now, Justice Breyer has asked the operative question. And -- and it's what confused me throughout, both in the discussions below and here. At first, I thought this case was only about reading your brief about whether the deprivation had to be of something the bank owned. As opposed to had a possessory interest in. And Justice Kagan rightly says you seem to have backed off from that claim. You seem to be saying ""owned"" can mean merely a possessory interest. Is that correct, now? All right. So if we disagree with you, if we were to say that this subsection 1 means that you are targeting property that -- depriving any bank of property in which it has a possessory interest -- -- and we say you don't have to prove the bank is going to lose anything of value, that it's going to be reimbursed by insurance or that ultimately the customer is going to receive -- bear the loss, so long as you have defrauded the bank, some deception to the bank, and deprived it of some possessory interest, whether it bears the loss or not, if that's how we rule, do you lose this case? We're disagreeing with you. That's how we're going to say what it means. All right. Do you think -- Don't forget instruction 21. You're cherry-picking. An intent to defraud is an intent to deceive or cheat. Why has -- why has the government forgotten when it's at trial that simplifying things for juries is always the best thing? Do you really think that any juror reading this would parse it with the care that you are? Why can't you just say something like a scheme to defraud a bank is a scheme to -- what was the three words? -- to deceive or cheat the money and to -- to cheat the bank of some interest in money or property? Counselor, assume I agree with you -- -- that there were parts of your argument, both below and here in your brief, that suggested the instructional error. But what I find is that the way you presented the argument was confusing. It took a lot of teasing out. Does -- how does that affect what we do. That -- that you weren't clear in the instruction, don't you forfeit that argument? I -- I know what your two claims are. The question is if I disagree -- -- with your basic premise that you need to prove pecuniary loss to the bank -- I know you want to win that, but please accept my hypothetical. I disagree with you that the only -- that the only issue is that you have to cheat and deprive the bank of a possessory -- of something in a possessory -- in their possessory interest. Okay? Simple as that. It doesn't have to cause -- you don't have to intend to cause pecuniary loss. All right? Where does that leave your instructional error? How about if I find that what you -- that you didn't articulate your argument clearly enough to the court below, or to us? Where does that put you? Have you forfeited? Do you waive? Have you done something?

2016,"Impression Products, Inc. v. Lexmark International, Inc.",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"So it's contributory negligence. What other patent ideas were not codified? Mr. Pincus. I've -- I've heard -- I've read and reread that argument, that the patentholder is not receiving value for its German patent. But the value that you receive I think is in the embodiment of the patent. And the whole concept of the first-sale doctrine, in my mind, is that the value is whatever you get for that product. And whether you have a U.S. patent or a German patent or a whatever patent, you're still getting value for that idea, for that discovery, for that whatever creative moment that you have that results in this final product. So I'm not quite sure I understand the -- the question of this, you know, you haven't received value for the German patent.

Because you can never predict what will actually happen in the end. You can only talk about what might happen. I'm not sure this helps you under our case law under Ginsberg and Ness, and that line of cases -- -- that the government relies on. If it's a prerequisite to getting citizenship, one of the -- their argument is that a prerequisite is not telling a falsehood, an intentional falsehood in your application. So how do you win, and how do you get causation into that? I'm sorry. I don't know how you can do -- that answers only a part of the materiality issue. If she lied to get her husband a benefit, that's an immigration benefit that she was seeking. She had to lie about his military service, otherwise, he would have been disqualified -- -- from naturalization. Is there any way they could have found otherwise? I -- I understand there are case laws. How about -- let me give you another example. One of the requirements is that you list any nickname that you've ever had. All right? When I was a child -- not me, but some imagined applicant -- (Laughter.) I was very slight of built -- I wasn't. (Laughter.) The applicant was. And his buddies were calling him the F word in terms of gender identity. He's not; never was. Or is and disclosed it in another part of the application. But that word embarrassed him, continues to embarrass him, and it has no importance to the decision-making process. Is that failure to disclose the use of a childhood nickname that is embarrassing, that has no relationship to anything whatsoever, could you prosecute that person? Exactly. Exactly. Mr. Parker -- The government -- the Congress doesn't have the power to denaturalize someone. At least so far we haven't let them do that as punishment for a criminal act. So how -- go back to Justice Kagan's question about footnote 4 in your brief, and your adversary's position that if it's a prerequisite to naturalization -- that's what this means -- that that's the only time Congress can deprive you of citizenship is when something actually would have barred you from getting it. I know the point you were trying to make -- -- but answer the point he has made -- -- and the point I have made, which is, if Congress doesn't have the power, ex post facto, to denaturalize you, we're giving them this power, should we be reading it narrowly or broadly? In which of those processes has there ever been the kind of immaterial statement that the Chief Justice gave, lying about a traffic ticket, where there's been no injury to anybody and no claim of reckless driving, other than the speeding?

2016,Howell v. Howell,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"No. I -- I think Justice Ginsburg's question is, the original divorce decree here said Petitioner's entitled to and is awarded as her sole and separate property 50 percent of Respondent's military retirement. If it had read Petitioner's entitled to $250 a month, period, full stop, to ensure that that is received by her, she'll get $250 a month from his Military Retirement Pay. So could she go back to court now and ask for a dollar figure instead? She can't go back into court -- I thought in divorce courts you can go back and change circumstances and seek a modification of the monetary awards. Why can't she do that? So is -- is -- So how could he take any action that impinges on what's her money or her property right? I -- I think that's the U.S.'s position and your adversary's, which is, if, as a result of the original settlement divorce decree, it became her property, what right did he have any -- to take any action that would remove that property or take it away from her? The problem is, really, that when people are getting divorced and they already know they can't divide up the disability pay, that the courts have a full picture and can then determine alimony and child custody with those factors in mind. And we presume that, at the time of their divorce, this woman was relying on a certain amount of income that would be fixed for the rest of her life, and she planned her life around that income. And he has now taken an act independent of her and not just reducing her income, but with her reduction of income, he's also getting a tax benefit. So he's getting, you know, whatever, 20 percent, a third more than she is by this unilateral act. In terms of policy, that is a substantially different impact -- -- and one that, you know, the government is taking the position that if you're doing this post-divorce, you're changing the nature of the policy. No. But what I'm saying to you, as a matter of policy, is that right? I don't -- I mean, I don't know the answer legally, but is -- there is a difference in terms of what Congress might have expected or not expected. Sure. But that goes to the issues of alimony and -- and child support. Those will get made up there. Well -- Well, how do you deal with your adversary's position that her borrowing from our prior case that the only reasonable expectation that the Court or she could have had was that his military pay was always subject to a potential deduction for disability pay? That's basically his argument, that the act tells anyone relying on military pay that it can, as a matter of law, be changed by a disability award. I know you do. The question is how and why. (Laughter.) So the -- the agreement, the court's order I know required him to pay a certain amount. It -- it took care of the Laches question. What happens moving forward? The military pays her 50 percent minus the disability pay and he has to pay separately the difference? Where he gets it from it doesn't matter? And -- and you may not know this, I don't know if it's in the record. Does he have a -- a job after he retired? More curiosity.

2016,"Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"So how is the building separate from the religious exercise therein? I believe that this playground is part of the ministry of this church. And, in fact, I look at its bylaws, I look at its advertisements, and it includes play and conducted in a religiously valuable way. I think that's the materials that you're -- that the church is advertising. How do you separate out its secular function from its religious function? Well, how about if the school does a prayer before the children start playing? Or how about if it chooses on a sunny day to do its religious instruction outside. How does the State know or how can it control without then controlling on the -- on the basis of belief and viewpoint? How could they control against that involvement? I'm sorry -- -- but it does -- Excuse me, but you were talking about Locke -- -- and how this is dissimilar from Locke. Well, there is a tradition. There are 39 States with constitutional amendments like the one Missouri has. That's a history that's even longer than the Locke history. And the essence of that history is, basically, we don't want to, as a country -- well, the vast majority of States, to fund houses of worship. One would think that if there's play in the joints, that that would include the concept that States are free to say we don't want to spend money from the public FIs on houses of worship. Now, you say this affects free exercise. We seem to be confusing money with religious practice. I don't think the two are tied. This church is not going to close its religious practices or its doors because its playground doesn't have these tires. So I'm not sure how this is a free-exercise question, because there is no effect on the religious beliefs. No one is asking the church to change its beliefs. In fact, no one is asking the church as a condition of saying don't use what we give you for religious purposes; they're not even doing that. They're just saying we don't want to be involved with the church. But why is that coercion with respect to your beliefs? But you can have a playground here. You have a playground. No one is taking the playground away from you. No. The priest was being penalized. The priest was being told you can't be a priest or a congressman. So you can't do one or the other. Here, there's nothing being taken away from. What do we do with discrimination for religion under your theory? Because the way you're going in your theory is an expansion of McDaniel; but putting aside that it's an expansion of McDaniel, what are we going to end up with when secular people say religious people are being discriminated in favor of and against us? If status should not be an effect on free exercise, what are we going to do with tax benefits? What are we going to do with all the exemptions that churches receive? Those are benefits. Well, there's plenty of people who would think tax exemption goes too far. But I don't. I'm just saying there are people who make that claim. There is a serious debate about that, isn't there? Mr. Cortman -- I'm sorry. Mr. Layton, I'm -- I'm -- I know the Court is very grateful that you took up the request of the Missouri Attorney General to defend the old position, but I -- I am worried about the, if not the mootness, the adversity in this case. If the Attorney General is in favor of the position that your adversary is taking, isn't his appointment of you creating adversity that doesn't exist? Well, but that's the question. It doesn't appear to be the position of the State right now. Reading through the lines of the Acting Attorney General to us, it doesn't appear that he believes that you're taking the right position. I'm asking a simple question. If she -- if the State and she as the representative of the State are not willing to fight this case, are they manufacturing adversity by appointing you? If we have no adversity, hasn't this case become mooted? All right.

2016,Manuel v. City of Joliet,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Was he subject to legal process?  If legal process is corrupted because there isn't -- I always understood legal process as used in Wallace and earlier of our cases as an independent intermediary, generally a judge or a grand jury or someone who looks at the facts as they exist and independently makes a determination whether probable cause has happened. If you have a corrupted legal process where what the independent adjudicator is looking at is not true because it's based on false information, have you received legal process -- proper legal process? And so I thought you've never received it, then doesn't your time to accrue for the improper detention occur when you're no longer detained?  Here, it was the not guilty; correct? So it's not a of whether -- when it starts.  The question is:  When does the illegal detention finish? And because you have there's been no intermediate force, no intermediary stepping in and breaking the chain of causation; correct? Am I understanding argument correctly? No, but I'm -- I -- I the only way I could think of it was thinking of it in this way, because you're not claiming malicious prosecution or not. So detention probable -- What happens to person who's let out on bail?  Are they out of luck under your theory? Are you defining ""detention"" as broadly as Justice Ginsburg was? Without legal. You're saying improper legal process. Is it a detention you've described this in various ways.  Is it a detention without constitutional probable cause?  Is it a detention with -- with no proper legal process?  Where exactly is the Fourth Amendment violation?  Because in false arrest and false imprisonment claims, according to Wallace, as soon as you get legal process, there's been an intervening end to the false imprisonment because someone else has imprisoned you. So what remains in this case?  How do we define the constitutional violation so -- All right.  So stop.  I understand you so far. The question presented was, I think -- I don't have it -- I do have it here. ""So whether an individual's Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure continues beyond legal process so as to allow a malicious prosecution claim based upon the Fourth Amendment."" The Chief Justice was right.  The question presented is, does the Fourth Amendment consonance house a malicious prosecution claim, which is something very different than what you're describing as a Fourth Amendment seizure and detention without legal process. But are you we have to take every element of the -- whatever the elements are?  Because from what I understand from the briefing, malicious prosecution is defined differently from State to State. So if that's the case, what are the elements that you see for a 1983 claim?  Does it include malice? In a State court proceeding, the State analogue, what would be the rule of accrual ending?  You get convicted; you don't find out about the false testimony until habeas, State or Federal. When, in that situation, would accrual occur? Why do you need to evidence to somebody who's fabricated the reasons why you're in jail?  And -- and I don't know why you would think that it's important to cut off recovery against the police officer who bases an arrest solely on fabrication.  It doesn't seem so horrible to me.  Years later or immediately, if you've done something as untoward as that, as unconstitutional as that, why should it matter? You know, it's not as if most States don't receive that kind of notice in these situations.  The defendants are just not believed in most, until some independent evidence is discovered long after the conviction.  In my experience -- and you can point to one that's different -- I've never come across any of these cases where any defendant falsely accused of a crime hasn't vigorously announced his or her innocence and vigorously tried to tell the authorities this police officer is corrupt. So I'm not -- I don't know what extra notice you need other than that.  The situation is unique. We're talking about total fabrication.  You have so many other ways out of liability, qualified immunity, Franks.

2016,Matal v. Tam,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Isn't it another way to say it's not clear enough for them to get it right? But I have -- Then I have a question for you. This is a bit different than most cases. No one is stopping your client from calling itself The Slants. No one is stopping them from advertising themselves that way, or signing contracts that way, or engaging in any activity, except that stopping someone else from using the same trademark. But even that they could do. Because you don't need a registered trademark to sue under the Lanham Act's entitlement for the confusion of the public in the use of any kind of registered or unregistered mark. If another band called themselves Slants, they would be subject to deceptive advertisements because they wouldn't be this Slants. So there is a big difference. You are asking the government to endorse your name to the extent of protecting it in a way that it chooses not to. So it -- there is a reason why the argument's appealing. And why shouldn't we consider it in those ways when your speech is not being burdened in any traditional way? It doesn't answer my question. You can still use your name. Why is it a burden? He can still sue. He can still compete. He's just not getting as much as he would like, but he's not stopped from doing what he's doing. Excuse me. Let's go back to, if we can, the earlier part of Justice Breyer's question. 1052 has two components. You can't disparage or falsely suggest a connection with a person institution. Are you challenging or saying that the second part of 1052 falsely suggests the connection is unconstitutional as well? I know. But your argument earlier was that if someone slanders or libels an individual by saying -- Trump before he was a public figure -- Trump is a thief and that becomes their trademark, that even if they go to court and prove that that's a libel or a slander, that trademark would still exist and would be capable of use because otherwise canceling it would be an abridgement of the First Amendment? That makes no sense.

2016,Davila v. Davis,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"But I have -- May I ask you, when do you believe that counsel below objected? And your brief seems to assume he did, but as I read the transcript, I can't find where he objected clearly. Assuming he didn't object clearly, can you say under any circumstance that appellate counsel was ineffective for choosing the route he did? Given plain error review, if there was no objection, wasn't the sufficiency of the evidence the best way to approach a forfeited error? He objected to the sequence of what the judge was saying. He didn't argue any transferred intent in the way that the Court later found in Roberts. I think it's Roberts, if I'm -- -- if my memory is correct. He didn't -- I don't see any discussion of the Roberts transferred intent. All he argued was, give the original instruction over again, and then give this new one. Counsel, you're not dealing with the question asked. All right? The question asked has to do with the burden on the courts. Both Justice Kennedy and Justice Roberts are saying, if we recognize this right, the courts are going to be inundated with these kinds of claims because in every State, ineffective assistance of appellate counsel isn't -- can't be, by definition, raised in direct review. It all has to be channelled to collateral review. So in every State, every defendant will be able to raise this claim and it will inundate the -- the system. And you haven't articulated the reasons you don't think so. I could start with how many post-conviction ineffective assistance of appellate counsel cases, the 31 percent that Justice Kennedy was pointing to, in how many of those is relief granted? Infinitesimally small. Ah, but does that -- does that mean that we don't remedy that? Assuming -- because, I agree -- Justice Breyer pointed out, and others have, the number of cases are going to be tiny. And as with all cases, there's an initial uptick of claims until people settle down and realize that it's a small number that are viable, and that happens pretty quickly. Do we ignore that simply because there might be that small uptick at the beginning? You mean the substantial claim of IAC? This is -- no one is going to be looking at an ineffective-assistance-of-appellate-counsel claim, assuming one is viable, unless there's a substantial claim, and no one will otherwise look at it. So let's go through the three pillars here. No one is reviewing whether appellate counsel has been adequate. Do you -- although you're not entitled constitutionally to appellate counsel on direct appeal, I don't know that we haven't, repeatedly, and so has every other court recognized the importance of counsel at the appellate level. I think virtually every State, if not every State, gives you a lawyer. So that prong is, in my mind, equal. The second prong is the -- Yes. I'm sorry. I -- I -- they're only -- they're not asking the question on the trial court whether appellate counsel has erred. They are asking a different question. Not just error, but error likely to result in a different outcome. But we already know that even under plain-error review, because we've done it in -- in a number of different cases, that trial courts err. The question is, did appellate counsel err in failing to raise something that might ultimately go to the Supreme Court, as has happened. They have ruled on -- they've ruled on a question of error below, but not a question of appellate counsel error. How many were granted? I'm sorry. That's not the test -- that's not the test. The test is, would it have resulted in a -- a difference on appellate review, not at trial. There's -- the appellate review is on the basis of the record as it exists, not on one that should have existed. Well, that's an interesting open question. ",but i have may i ask you when do you believe that counsel below object and your brief seem to assume he do but as i read the transcript i can not find where he object clearly assume he do not object clearly can you say under any circumstance that appellate counsel be ineffective for choose the route he do give plain error review if there be no objection be not the sufficiency of the evidence the best way to approach a forfeited error he object to the sequence of what the judge be say he do not argue any transferred intent in the way that the court later find in robert i think it be robert if I be if my memory be correct he do not i do not see any discussion of the robert transfer intent all he argue be give the original instruction over again and then give this new one counsel you be not deal with the question ask all right the question ask have to do with the burden on the court both justice kennedy and justice robert be say if we recognize this right the court be go to be inundate with these kind of claim because in every state ineffective assistance of appellate counsel be not can not be by definition raise in direct review it all have to be channel to collateral review so in every state every defendant will be able to raise this claim and it will inundate the the system and you have not articulate the reason you do not think so i could start with how many post conviction ineffective assistance of appellate counsel case the percent that justice kennedy be point to in how many of those be relief grant infinitesimally small ah but do that do that mean that we do not remedy that assume because i agree justice breyer point out and others have the number of case be go to be tiny and as with all case there be an initial uptick of claim until people settle down and realize that it be a small number that be viable and that happen pretty quickly do we ignore that simply because there might be that small uptick at the beginning you mean the substantial claim of iac this be no one be go to be look at an ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim assume one be viable unless there be a substantial claim and no one will otherwise look at it so let us go through the three pillar here no one be review whether appellate counsel have be adequate do you although you be not entitle constitutionally to appellate counsel on direct appeal i do not know that we have not repeatedly and so have every other court recognize the importance of counsel at the appellate level i think virtually every state if not every state give you a lawyer so that prong be in my mind equal the second prong be the yes I be sorry i i they be only they be not ask the question on the trial court whether appellate counsel have err they be ask a different question not just error but error likely to result in a different outcome but we already know that even under plain error review because we have do it in in a number of different case that trial court err the question be do appellate counsel err in fail to raise something that might ultimately go to the supreme court as have happen they have rule on they have rule on a question of error below but not a question of appellate counsel error how many we be grant I be sorry that be not the test that be not the test the test be would it have result in a a difference on appellate review not at trial there be the appellate review be on the basis of the record as it exist not on one that should have exist well that be an interesting open question ,294.11999999999995,Roberts Court,"Apr 24, 2017",Erick Daniel Davila,"Lorie Davie, Director, Texas Dept. of Criminal Justice, Correctional Institutions Division",16-6219,"Jan 13, 2017","Jun 26, 2017",113.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1

If we leveled up, how would that affect children who were born to an -- to a citizen father, who were previously denied citizenship, could they come in and claim citizenship now? Which means? The answer is yes? The continuous one year. Perhaps you're assuming Justice Ginsburg's point that the father still has to have legitimatized the child without marriage. Because if they married the mother, they would end up having to fulfill the five-year. So it would have to be -- are you accepting her proposition that the father has to legitimatize the child? Well, we aren't leaving children uncovered whose mothers have not had a continuous one-year residency in the United States, even though that mother may be an American citizen. I just said they do. Because the mother can only pass on citizenship if she's been in the United States continuously for one year prior to the birth of the child, correct?

2016,Salman v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Don't you think that his brother's statement -- when he was asked about trading by Maher, the younger brother, he said, I owe somebody money. Isn't that most naturally read to be either give me the money to pay this person back or give me information that lets me pay him back? Isn't that always the quid pro quo of a gift, that you believe that if you give someone a gift, it's going to cost you one way or another? You're going to give them something of value, or you're going to substitute money for the gift, or you're going to do something that saves you money by giving the tip. That's true, but then comes the government's suggestion that the disclosure has to be for a personal benefit or a personal purpose, that there has to be a reason you're doing it, not accidentally, not -- not unknowingly, but something you're doing because you want to receive some benefit from it. Wait a minute. First of all, that's no longer true. There's regulations that stop that, talking to analysts. But talk about the culpability question. Why is it any less culpable to give your close relative, who you've been supporting every month for your entire life, so instead of giving him, one month or two months, that regular one hundred dollar bill, you choose to give him corporate information. That's Justice Kagan's example. Why is that person more culpable than the person who just -- a relative comes and says, it would be nice; I need some money. And you give him a tip instead of the cash. But Congress doesn't define what's deceptive or manipulative or -- what's the third word? -- what defrauds. It has general words. Don't devise a scheme that does these things. The law has for ages said that the failure to -- to speak when you're obligated to; i.e., an insider who doesn't disclose that he's using your information is an omission that's been, classically, a fraud. So I don't understand why you keep saying that the law doesn't define this. Except your defining limit? It has to be tangible? If we disagree with you because of the gift language of Dirks, how else could you suggest to limit liability? What other ways are there to take care of someone who -- closer cases that exist? Lisser has given us one proposal. What's yours? Besides the fact it has to be a tangible benefit. Mr. Dreeben, I'm -- I'm not sure that your solution is going to clarify much of this area, because now I think the fight is going to be over what was the reason that the tipper gave for giving the tip. I mean, in this very case, there were three reasons for breaching the rule of confidentiality. The first, to -- for Maher to become more knowledgeable of the health care industry. Under your reading, if he had no knowledge his brother would trade, that was not actionable; correct? No. I'm talking about that there are three examples of breaching confidentiality. The first was to -- for him to become more knowledgeable of the health industry. The second was to help the father with his medical care. And the third, the one you charged, was the giving of information, knowing that his brother was going to trade on it. How do you draw the line among those three? All three were for personal reasons. So you have -- So if all he did it for was to get information for his father, had no idea that his brother was trading, he would not be liable and his brother wouldn't be liable. So why do you want to put knowledge of the -- knowledge that it will be used for trading as part of the breach of fiduciary duty? If you do that, then you have to prove that the tippee knew that the tipper thought it would be traded. Why can't you put it in the intent to defraud? So why -- why make it part of the breach -- Mr. Dreeben, I think you're taking this way out of existing law. Are you going to suggest that tippees aren't routinely prosecuted when tippers don't know that they are going to trade? I think they are, and most often it's because you claim that they should have known it was confidential information. There's plenty -- there's a legion of cases I read for this -- preparing for this argument where the government has said -- So you're going to let go of the guy that Justice Alito -- the guy on the street who looks dejected is not my friend or a close relative, but I give him a tip and say, go trade on this. It will make you a lot of money. That person -- that tipper would not be liable. So it's irrelevant whether it's a friend or family member? So is there a difference between friend and acquaintance, as you're talking? Tell me. Is recklessness used? ",do not you think that his brother s statement when he be ask about trading by maher the young brother he say i owe somebody money be not that most naturally read to be either give me the money to pay this person back or give me information that let us me pay him back be not that always the quid pro quo of a gift that you believe that if you give someone a gift it be go to cost you one way or another you be go to give them something of value or you be go to substitute money for the gift or you be go to do something that save you money by give the tip that be true but then come the government s suggestion that the disclosure have to be for a personal benefit or a personal purpose that there have to be a reason you be do it not accidentally not not unknowingly but something you be do because you want to receive some benefit from it wait a minute first of all that be no longer true there have regulation that stop that talk to analyst but talk about the culpability question why be it any less culpable to give your close relative who you have be support every month for your entire life so instead of give him one month or two month that regular one hundred dollar bill you choose to give him corporate information that be justice kagan s example why be that person more culpable than the person who just a relative come and say it would be nice i need some money and you give him a tip instead of the cash but congress do not define what be deceptive or manipulative or what be the third word what defrauds it have general word do not devise a scheme that do these thing the law have for age say that the failure to to speak when you be obligate to ie an insider who do not disclose that he be use your information be an omission that be be classically a fraud so i do not understand why you keep say that the law do not define this except your define limit it have to be tangible if we disagree with you because of the gift language of dirk how else could you suggest to limit liability what other way be there to take care of someone who closer case that exist lisser have give us one proposal what have yours besides the fact it have to be a tangible benefit mr dreeben I be I be not sure that your solution be go to clarify much of this area because now i think the fight be go to be over what be the reason that the tipper give for give the tip i mean in this very case there we be three reason for breach the rule of confidentiality the first to for maher to become more knowledgeable of the health care industry under your reading if he have no knowledge his brother would trade that be not actionable correct no I be talk about that there be three example of breach confidentiality the first be to for him to become more knowledgeable of the health industry the second be to help the father with his medical care and the third the one you charge be the give of information know that his brother be go to trade on it how do you draw the line among those three all three we be for personal reason so you have so if all he do it for be to get information for his father have no idea that his brother be trading he would not be liable and his brother would not be liable so why do you want to put knowledge of the knowledge that it will be use for trading as part of the breach of fiduciary duty if you do that then you have to prove that the tippee know that the tipper think it would be trade why can not you put it in the intent to defraud so why why make it part of the breach mr dreeben i think you be take this way out of exist law be you go to suggest that tippees be not routinely prosecute when tipper do not know that they be go to trade i think they be and most often it be because you claim that they should have know it be confidential information there be plenty there have a legion of case i read for this preparing for this argument where the government have say so you be go to let go of the guy that justice alito the guy on the street who look deject be not my friend or a close relative but i give him a tip and say go trade on this it will make you a lot of money that person that tipper would not be liable so it be irrelevant whether it be a friend or family member so be there a difference between friend and acquaintance as you be talk tell me be recklessness use ,339.7199999999999,Roberts Court,"Oct 5, 2016",Bassam Yacoub Salman,United States,15-628,"Jan 19, 2016","Dec 6, 2016",113.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2016,"California Public Employees’ Retirement System v. ANZ Securities, Inc.",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Goldstein, as I understand your adversary, and he'll speak for himself when he gets up, but a motion to intervene doesn't save you. Because according to him, it's only a separately filed complaint that would be a separate action subject to the three-year period of repose, correct? That's why I said -- I'm -- I'm just wondering what happens to American Pipe, in terms of not opting out -- -- meaning that the Court just denies the class certification. What happens to all of those cases? In normal parlance, the one named plaintiff continues, but how about if there's 10 or 20? In that one case -- -- or would they be spun off into their own jurisdictions? If -- if class certification -- Yes, class certification is denied. What I'm asking, would it be the same action or would they be spun off into different cases? Because often, maybe common questions are certified -- -- and the original courts maintain jurisdiction. But did you -- Mr. Clement, I'd like to go through the practical consequences. Okay? So let me start with the simplest one. Okay? A class action motion is filed. The court dismisses it saying, wrong venue. This should have been in California instead of New York. Under your theory, because a new complaint is filed in California, that statute of limitations or that statute of repose starts to run from the filing of the new complaint, not the old one? There is a rule that says if you're in the wrong venue, there's an automatic tolling. But you're saying that that rule would not apply in that circumstance. But so could the judge. You could -- you can ask for it, but it's still within the judge's discretion whether to transfer or dismiss and let you file anew. So answer my question. Under your theory -- under your theory, action means new complaint, new complaint number? Even though it's asking for the same relief? By the same party? All right. So that means motions to intervene won't help -- -- if the class is ultimately denied. So what happens when the complaint is denied? All of those individual complaints -- most of them are not transferred. They're spun off into new complaints in where -- whatever jurisdiction has venue over them. So what's an opt-out? Why couldn't -- -- could the judge have -- or can a judge, who has a class action and tells people, if you opt out, just file a motion to intervene? Under your theory, why can't they do that?

2016,Turner v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counselor? At the trial, the witness, Mr. Freeman, indicated that there were two people acting suspiciously. He raised an objection that those names had not been disclosed. The prosecutor explained his reasons for not disclosing the names, and defense counsel chose to say, I'll get them on the -- I'll call the witness and get the names myself, and then he dropped the ball. What also occurred was that these -- this -- this name was given to him as a -- was given to him and all defense counsel as a possibility within the materials that were disclosed, that Mr. McMillan had been on the scene and no follow-up was done. How can we say that it was undisclosed or not made available in light of those record facts? I'm sorry, but I -- I -- my greatest difficulty with Mr. McMillan is that clearly his '92 crime, which was decades after this crime, suggests a similarity that would have been very potent at a trial. But the disclosure of this Brady, of Mr. McMillan, wouldn't have led to the introduction of that later-committed crime. So what we're left with as an alternative theory is robberies of two women, neither of which were in any way identical to this crime. All of the defendants had crimes of violence and robberies, so their criminal activity was just as bad, if not worse in some cases, than Mr. McMillan, why would he have been a likely source as an alternative perpetrator, particularly as a sole perpetrator, when he was seen with at least one other person? He wasn't alone when he was seen. He was seen with another man. There's no suggestion that the other man was involved. So how -- how does he become such a potent alternative in light of those facts? He's just like the defendants. He is with another person, so being a solo -- a solo perpetrator is not a natural conclusion. So how do we get him to be the other person? Did Mr. Thomas ever recant? Mr. Dreeben, it's a hard case about whether it was one or more perpetrators. More than likely more than one. The question is which ones. We know they acquit two, the jury, and on two of them they deliberate longer, and they, I believe, report not being able to reach a verdict on Overton and Turner. So something was holding them up with respect to those two defendants. If that's the case, why would it take very little to say that at least with those two defendants, all of the cumulative effect of the withheld evidence reasonably could have made a difference? So, Mr. Dreeben, why did it take the jury longer? Mr. Williams could you list for me the legal errors the court made below? I'm sorry go through that one again.

2016,Czyzewski v. Jevic Holding Corp.,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"May I ask you: Did the settlement bar you from suing the debtor for the WARN Act claims? And there was no money left to the debtor. So did it bar you from suing Sun Life for a fraudulent transfer, which -- It did. All right. In the court below, I understand that the -- that you represented that if this settlement went through, that you would have -- I'm sorry -- that if -- without the settlement, you would really have nothing, because there was no money in the estate. So are you representing that your client intends to sue Sun Life? Because that's the only way to get money here. That's fine. Tell me which one you're going to do. All right. So what do you -- are you going to ask them to do? But there is no money in the estate to do that. So how will the trustee do that? If -- Please. Do you believe that the question presented here did not address the issue before us? Do you see a difference between the question presented that talked about the absolute priority rule as it relates to settlement proceeds and the ""structured dismissal"" here. Well, I -- I -- it goes to a more fundamental question, which is, is there a difference or in our ruling whether we say no settlement proceeds can be distributed in violation of the absolute priority rule from a statement that no dismissal, structured dismissal, can be entered in violation of the absolute priority rule. I do think there is a difference. You took away -- you took away a legal right from them. They had a legal right to sue Sun Life. They had a legal right to pursue their other claims. And the settlement extinguished those rights. I don't know why this is a rare case. I mean, every structured settlement of this kind is trying to exclude one set of creditors. And this is exactly what this did, and it did it in collusion among the senior and junior creditors to the exclusion of the disfavored creditor. I'm not -- I'm not -- I'm just trying -- -- to figure out what creates the exception. But I don't understand how you get to an extraordinary circumstance in that -- in this situation. It seems to me that wanting to exclude the claims of one or more creditors is the ordinary situation. Every junior creditor wants money. They're happy to exclude anybody they can -- -- or anybody who will concede to doing it. So how do you protect the excluded creditor from being preyed on by one of the other creditors? We already know the junior creditors have a self-interest. The senior creditors have -- It happens to be one of the biggest senior creditors here is the one who was insisting upon excluding the junior creditor. So where do we go? How do we defined ""extraordinary""? Mr. Landau, is there a difference, in your mind, because there might be in mine, between a settlement that settles an individual claim, the emergency creditor claim that your -- that your opponent spoke about, where there is not a total distribution of the assets of the company, from a plan that's really just an alternative plan, because that's what this structured settlement was? In my mind, something that would be an extraordinary circumstance -- -- would be something that did something like the first thing, and not necessarily the second. So would you tell -- -- me why Sun Life -- Sun Life cared? If it got its settlement -- i.e., it was going to pay $2 million and get all the claims against it released -- what was its reason for not wanting the proceeds to be distributed according to the absolute priority rule? Well, I'm -- I'm sorry. Does this mean that the junior creditors wouldn't have agreed to this settlement because the senior creditors could have? What did the senior creditors, who were in line -- in line care about how much was left over to junior creditors, including Sun Life? But why? Why does it care? Why does Sun Life care? No, the settlement would have been the one that occurred. If it -- So do you think they can still sue you for those fraudulent conveyance claims? Not you; Sun Life. The fraudulent-transfer claim? You don't understand. My basic question was -- -- what did Sun Life care if the fraudulent conveyance claim was going to be resolved and released? Why did it care to exclude these truck drivers from receiving whatever they demanded? But that eventually -- you had already -- Sun Life had already won that. ",may i ask you do the settlement bar you from sue the debtor for the warn act claim and there be no money leave to the debtor so do it bar you from sue sun life for a fraudulent transfer which it do all right in the court below i understand that the that you represent that if this settlement go through that you would have I be sorry that if without the settlement you would really have nothing because there be no money in the estate so be you represent that your client intend to sue sun life because that be the only way to get money here that be fine tell me which one you be go to do all right so what do you be you go to ask them to do but there be no money in the estate to do that so how will the trustee do that if please do you believe that the question present here do not address the issue before us do you see a difference between the question present that talk about the absolute priority rule as it relate to settlement proceeds and the structured dismissal here well i i it go to a more fundamental question which be be there a difference or in our rule whether we say no settlement proceeds can be distribute in violation of the absolute priority rule from a statement that no dismissal structure dismissal can be enter in violation of the absolute priority rule i do think there be a difference you take away you take away a legal right from them they have a legal right to sue sun life they have a legal right to pursue their other claim and the settlement extinguish those right i do not know why this be a rare case i mean every structured settlement of this kind be try to exclude one set of creditor and this be exactly what this do and it do it in collusion among the senior and junior creditor to the exclusion of the disfavored creditor I be not I be not I be just try to figure out what create the exception but i do not understand how you get to an extraordinary circumstance in that in this situation it seem to me that want to exclude the claim of one or more creditor be the ordinary situation every junior creditor want money they be happy to exclude anybody they can or anybody who will concede to do it so how do you protect the excluded creditor from be prey on by one of the other creditor we already know the junior creditor have a self interest the senior creditor have it happen to be one of the big senior creditor here be the one who be insist upon exclude the junior creditor so where do we go how do we define extraordinary mr landau be there a difference in your mind because there might be in mine between a settlement that settle an individual claim the emergency creditor claim that your that your opponent spoke about where there be not a total distribution of the asset of the company from a plan that be really just an alternative plan because that be what this structure settlement be in my mind something that would be an extraordinary circumstance would be something that do something like the first thing and not necessarily the second so would you tell me why sun life sun life care if it get its settlement ie it be go to pay million and get all the claim against it release what be its reason for not want the proceeds to be distribute accord to the absolute priority rule well I be I be sorry do this mean that the junior creditor would not have agree to this settlement because the senior creditor could have what do the senior creditor who we be in line in line care about how much be leave over to junior creditor include sun life but why why do it care why do sun life care no the settlement would have be the one that occur if it so do you think they can still sue you for those fraudulent conveyance claim not you sun life the fraudulent transfer claim you do not understand my basic question be what do sun life care if the fraudulent conveyance claim be go to be resolve and release why do it care to exclude these truck driver from receive whatever they demand but that eventually you have already sun life have already win that ,295.7700000000001,Roberts Court,"Dec 7, 2016","Casimir Czyzewski, et al.","Jevic Holding Corp., et al.",15-649,"Jun 28, 2016","Mar 22, 2017",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2016,Beckles v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Perhaps if we go back to the process here. The Guidelines were passed, including the residual clause at one point in time; correct? Was it the Commission? Aren't those amendments approved by Congress? That's my question. So the commentary is not approved by Congress, and that commentary that added the sawed-off shotgun, was it simultaneous with the adoption of the residual clause to define crime of violence? Wasn't the essence of our ruling in Johnson that it's one thing to ask a judge to apply a determination to existing facts, as opposed to what happens with the residual clause, which is you're asking a judge to basically fantasize about what the average case is like? And so Guidelines that you're being asked to apply to specific facts are reviewable by a court, aren't they? We can look at the facts and say, was the judge right? Was this more than minimal planning or not? Correct? But it's almost impossible, according to Johnson, to find what an ordinary case would look like because there was no standard of comparison of what ordinary meant. There are -- there are circuit courts who already permit vagueness challenges to provisions, right? Was this -- Was this 40 percent normal for this judge? Did he say he was basing it on a percentage? Well, why is this -- I guess the real question on this last point is: If what we're trying to do is to regulate the defendant's conduct, not possessing this thing or not committing a crime of violence, and he knows because the commentary tells him that if he does possess a sawed-off shotgun, he's going to get this enhancement, what's arbitrary at sentencing for imposing what the defendant already knows is illegal or will subject him to the greater enhancement? I buy your argument in terms of it would be arbitrary to the Johnson reasoning to have a judge determine that a sawed-off shotgun -- -- is violent in one situation but not in another. But if the issue of arbitrariness is the arbitrariness and capriciousness of enforcement, here the defendant knew that he was going to be subject to the enhancement at the time he committed the crime. I agree no discretion to apply the Guideline. But -- How is this different from all of the examples the government gave in pages 55 to 57 or the others where we've had a vague statute and the administrative agency has narrowed it, or you have a municipal ordinance that narrows, that the city narrows in its administrative processes? And all of those cases when they are challenged for vagueness, we look at how the statute is applied to the individual. How is this situation any different? If the statute was vague, it's vague. And what we've done instead is say, no, it's not vague, because the agency has narrowed its application. Mr. Dreeben, can we go back to Justice Kennedy's question? In Montgomery, we had a rule that appeared procedural, just like this one. The judge at sentencing could still sentence the defendant to life without parole after a particular finding, i.e., that the individual was irredeemable. Why is that different than here? Meaning, if the Guidelines are procedural in the Montgomery sense because they are an anchor on what a judge does, why isn't there a substantial risk like in Montgomery that a defendant is going to be sentenced because of the Guideline and not because of a finding that he or she is entitled to that sentence? And I take that to be -- that substantial risk to be proven by your own statistic. 80 percent of judges sentence within the Guidelines. But more importantly for those circuits that have permitted or -- or have applied retroactive activity to Johnson and defendants have been resentenced, the vast majority have received a much lower sentence. But doesn't a judge still have to make a finding that there's a reason to give a defendant a higher sentence? There may be some judges who determine the nature of the past conduct qualifies this defendant for career criminal status, but absent that, it seems like the vast majority of those judges who are now resentencing don't believe that those -- that prior criminal history justifies the higher sentence. Could I just ask something? If we rule in your favor and say it's not retroactive, how much is left of the Johnson ruling? What effect would it have? How many cases are there in fact, except the -- I guess it's the felon in possession cases would be the one example that the Guideline -- that the Guidelines haven't already been structured to take care of all career offenders. Outside of felon and possessions -- -- can you think of any other situations? You're not quite answering my question. What other situations besides the felon in possession would Johnson and Welch be operative? Because as I understand it, in virtually all cases, most others, the Guidelines are within the statutory maximum. Mr. Dreeben, what will happen to all those cases that have been resentenced already? Even the -- where the circuits said no retroactivity -- where they have permitted retroactivity? But they've been resentencing? If I were a district court judge and I wasn't going to change the sentence no matter what -- what the reason for the retroactivity ruling, I would have just had the sentence. I was known for that. (Laughter.) I'm sorry. It wasn't arbitrary to the judge at issue -- -- meaning, the judge at issue always had his or her own reasons. What was arbitrary was that one judge could have put different values on a reason in one place and -- in New York and different values in California. That's a very different form of arbitrariness.

That's the line you're drawing? Because someone puts something on instead of handing it around, that's the line you want us to draw? How about issues on the ballot? All right. So let's talk about a fiscal matter. Could someone then wear a button or a shirt or could the state ban a button or a shirt that said ""Restrain Government Spending""? I think your adversary says they can because it's a political issue display. And that's where you say they can't? Even though that's on the ballot? To you. But do you think a reasonable observer would think it's too attenuated? Can you -- You took the position that ""Me Too"" -- ""Please ID Me"" wasn't intimidating. Or that it was free speech that should not be stifled, correct? Are you changing your mind on that now? So there's always line-drawing. Whether you call it intimidating speech or not, someone's going to have to draw a line. So going back to Justice Kennedy's point, why, if this is not a public forum, why can't the state reasonably draw the line at saying political speech of any kind can be potentially intimidating in a voting place and we won't permit it? It does. You can vote. That's the permitted act, political activity. So it's not all that's being -- I mean, I suspect that on a military base we would say it would be okay for the Army to say on military grounds we're not going to permit political speech.

Do you have any proof? You have one person who says that this process delayed him five hours. Any process you institute, there's going to be an aberration. Your adversary says that most of the time this goes by very quickly. Most of the time the -- the election judge or whomever tells the wearer please cover up your button or take it off, and people do that. So do we rule for the aberration or do we rule for the norm?

2017,McCoy v. Louisiana,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. -- Mr. Waxman -- Mr. Waxman, this sounds like a -- my ethics class in law school, and this very hypothetical of what do you do with a lying client? And it was my understanding that every ethics rule requires the lawyer to put the client on the stand but not assist the client in telling the lie by -- you can put him on the stand and say tell your story. And if the judge or someone objects that your -- that this person's rambling on, you say to the judge: I cannot ask questions. My client has directed me to put him or her on the stand. People can walk themselves into jail. They can walk themselves, regrettably, into the gas chamber. But they have a right to tell their story. Absolutely not. But the question -- So let me find -- So may I ask -- may I just -- Excuse me, Mr. Waxman -- Mr. Waxman, can -- Taking Justice Alito's hypothetical, I walk in and say it is the government's burden to prove this case beyond a reasonable doubt. It means that they have to prove each and every element of the offense. The actus reus, the mens rea, whatever other important element there is. If the government were to prove every other element in this case beyond a reasonable doubt, the one they can't prove is that the person who shot this person did it with -- with the right mens rea. That would be okay? Hasn't conceded the person committed the elements and is saying I'm putting your focus just on mens rea. Right? I'm sorry, you started by saying you want a narrow rule. Why is it narrow? It seems to me that it's a rule that you're saying is absolute. Why does it have to be just in death penalty cases? How do you limit your -- why would we limit your rule? Is it the rules of professional conduct or is it the Sixth Amendment? The Sixth Amendment requires you to be represented by counsel, effective counsel, but counsel. Or do you concede that generally or all the time -- let's not say this is a death case, let's just say this was a robbery case, all right? A robbery case. The defendant says: I wasn't the robber. Can the lawyer come in and do what Mr. English did: Yes, he was the robber, but, no, he didn't intend to force -- to use force. So you don't think it's a Sixth Amendment violation? So -- so you're not taking the position when you're saying generally that -- that a client has any right to say I didn't do this in court? I didn't do -- I didn't shoot, I didn't rob, I didn't make that call that that witness says I made, that the witness -- that a -- that a client, once he takes a lawyer, takes -- doesn't have a right to say I didn't do it -- -- at all? One of my former colleagues said this isn't -- one must analogize these things to agency, that the defendant -- the lawyer is the agent of the defendant. And once they disagree, the agency ends. So, if the agency has ended because the client has said: Don't do this, how can it not be a violation of the Sixth Amendment to do it? I'm sorry, I thought it's been not disputed that he thought, quite wrongly, that there was no mens rea for second-degree murder but that it's been conceded that what -- there -- that there was a mens rea both for first and second degree and he was only arguing for second degree? I'm sorry, but there is a mens rea for second degree murder. And so -- -- you concede that there wasn't second degree? So the further -- So the further footnote is it's -- only happens if your client's not rational, that that's where you have the freedom to ignore your client? I'm sorry. I thought -- I'll go back to it, but I thought the essence of his closing statement was he's not deserving of the death penalty because, as you heard him, he's a sick man. ",mr mr waxman mr waxman this sound like a my ethic class in law school and this very hypothetical of what do you do with a lie client and it be my understanding that every ethic rule require the lawyer to put the client on the stand but not assist the client in tell the lie by you can put him on the stand and say tell your story and if the judge or someone object that your that this person s rambling on you say to the judge i can not ask question my client have direct me to put him or her on the stand people can walk themselves into jail they can walk themselves regrettably into the gas chamber but they have a right to tell their story absolutely not but the question so let me find so may i ask may i just excuse me mr waxman mr waxman can take justice alito s hypothetical i walk in and say it be the government s burden to prove this case beyond a reasonable doubt it mean that they have to prove each and every element of the offense the actus reus the men rea whatever other important element there be if the government we be to prove every other element in this case beyond a reasonable doubt the one they can not prove be that the person who shoot this person do it with with the right mens rea that would be okay have not concede the person commit the element and be say I be put your focus just on men rea right I be sorry you start by say you want a narrow rule why be it narrow it seem to me that it be a rule that you be say be absolute why do it have to be just in death penalty case how do you limit your why would we limit your rule be it the rule of professional conduct or be it the sixth amendment the sixth amendment require you to be represent by counsel effective counsel but counsel or do you concede that generally or all the time let us not say this be a death case let us just say this be a robbery case all right a robbery case the defendant say i be not the robber can the lawyer come in and do what mr english do yes he be the robber but no he do not intend to force to use force so you do not think it be a sixth amendment violation so so you be not take the position when you be say generally that that a client have any right to say i do not do this in court i do not do i do not shoot i do not rob i do not make that call that that witness say i make that the witness that a that a client once he take a lawyer take do not have a right to say i do not do it at all one of my former colleague say this be not one must analogize these thing to agency that the defendant the lawyer be the agent of the defendant and once they disagree the agency end so if the agency have end because the client have say do not do this how can it not be a violation of the sixth amendment to do it I be sorry i think it be be not dispute that he think quite wrongly that there be no men rea for second degree murder but that it be be concede that what there that there be a mens rea both for first and second degree and he be only argue for second degree I be sorry but there be a mens rea for second degree murder and so you concede that there be not second degree so the further so the further footnote be it be only happen if your client s not rational that that be where you have the freedom to ignore your client I be sorry i think I will go back to it but i think the essence of his closing statement be he be not deserve of the death penalty because as you hear him he be a sick man ,297.4400000000001,Roberts Court,"Jan 17, 2018",Robert McCoy,State of Louisiana,16-8255,"Sep 28, 2017","May 14, 2018",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2017,Benisek v. Lamone,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Given the equitable principles involved in an injunction, this is -- you waited an awfully long time to bring this suit from the change in 2011, was it? Should that factor into our consideration of whether to uphold or not uphold your request? Let me ask you a practical question. This is a denial of a preliminary injunction. You still have a merits trial to go through or not? Now can you go through that trial without a ruling from us? And, if not, why not? Judge Niemeyer said that there were many open issues in this case, not the least of which was the motivation of the -- of the Governor and his committee for the change at issue. Would that obviate some of the merits questions that are before us if you don't prove that first prong? You have fairly strong evidence to -- to show that. Is your weakness in the other prongs? No, assuming we accept your test. (Laughter.) I -- I agree. But assuming we -- we leave it the way it is, what happens? There's been a lot of -- May I ask you, is this -- is yours the -- is yours the only test you're proposing? In other political gerrymandering cases, do you see other tests being a possibility? Is this the only, versus -- I didn't ask that. In other gerrymandering cases. Do you see the applicability of any other test? You have a lot of amici with different tests, the ACLU. The others have proposed tests that would address some of Justice Kagan's concern, the entrenchment test, the durability test, that sort of thing. Why did you disavow those? Do you lose under those? Or is yours -- do you think yours is just easier? Under your theory, do you think the Democrats in the Eighth District have a complaint? That's not de minimis. You're saying there's no burden at all. You're saying there wasn't an intent to burden their association. All right. So that's different than de minimis. I don't know. He says not at all. He says it -- it's too much if that's all you're doing. That's basically as I read his argument. If that's all you're doing, then it's too much. Now, under that test, he might lose, because you're claiming there were other reasons for this. But that's an issue of fact for the jury, I think. You have some pretty damning evidence that it might not have been. You have your own mayor saying -- your own governor, pardon me -- Yeah, your own governor saying that he felt duty-bound to ensure that his party won. And there are basically statements to that effect here. So that tells -- that gives you a standard. You may not like it, but it does give you a standard. Well, how much is too much is when, I think, balled up in the question of which there -- I -- I grant you they're a little bit equivocal of who bears this burden, but they're -- they are saying that we have to show that there's some form of entrenchment, that the intent is to ensure that only Democrats will be capable of winning in this district for the life of the census or the life of this boundary. So you -- you have a -- you have some form of too much. But we haven't -- We have found standards on things like how many -- what's the burden of treating different political parties to a requirement of signatures to get on the ballot. And we've said in those situations we look to the nature of the burden. We look to the expense. We -- we look to a variety of different factors to inform the seriousness of the burden. The First Amendment has worked well in those cases. Are you just merely suggesting it can't work well here because the redistricting process is so complex? Is that your only reason? Or is it -- what exactly makes it workable in one context but not particularly in this one? But not to discriminate. You -- you answered Justice Kennedy -- -- by saying you don't have a right to discriminate. But the whole -- the whole purpose of a gerrymandering attack is that I am being discriminated against or at least the theory of their case because of the views I have expressed over time, and that those views want to be silenced by the other side. Are you essentially saying -- are you agreeing that gerrymandering is not justiciable? So go back to my question, why? Would you -- do you agree with the court below that it can be made manageable if you introduce the test that it suggests plaintiff has to undertake? So answer why. The court there seemed to agree, certainly the dissent, Judge Niemeyer, thought it was manageable, but -- -- why do you disagree with the majority? The majority is basically saying it could be -- it could be, though, but you have to prove these other things. Counsel, given their evidence, they certainly have enough to go to a jury on that question -- -- whether there really was any legislative intent outside of the gerrymandering.

2017,Ayestas v. Davis,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Do you -- Do you believe that the statute can be read to mean that a district court, even if it finds reasonable necessity, that it has the authority not to award fees? And what would those be and what if a judge exercises that discretion improperly? So you believe it's appealable but under an abuse of discretion standard? Now, do you think that that includes an attorney -- that's not the facts of your case. I -- I know that in your case the defendant himself, to the first investigator who interviewed him, said he had had head traumas and -- and some dependency. And by the time the request for investigative services came about, he had already had a schizophrenic episode. But how about a case where there's no evidence whatsoever of dependency and/or of any mental illness, mental challenges, whatever you want to call it? Can an attorney come in and say it is common practice to do this, so I want to do it anyway? Even though there is no suggestion in the record that this is a fruitful inquiry? So where do you go if a circuit is arbitrarily and capriciously saying, we're not going to give any funds, period. You're going to tell me that won't happen, but during the financial crisis not so long ago, they had a reason, but whether that takes care of your right to counsel and counsel that has the resources to do the work necessary to represent you is a different question, a constitutional question. So what happens in that situation? Where does the defendant go? By the way, in which ways is this outside of the judicial branch? I mean, I understand our prior cases where we were asked to review a claim and it then went to the Secretary of the Treasury, who had absolute discretion to grant the claim or not. That went outside the judiciary. But how does this go outside the judiciary? Well, we also know that those things don't get records made. But here this is required by statute to be put -- to be made a part of the record. Potential what -- you put things to be on the record -- But, I'm sorry, the Fifth Circuit didn't rely on that ground. Neither have you below. So we reach out to a totally new question in which there's no circuit split and answer that question? Well, I'm not sure it's open after Martinez and Trevino given the nature of our language in those decisions. But that's a merits issue on the question. But having said that, why do we reach it? So -- Counsel, he did -- Counsel, how can you justify saying there wasn't deficient trial performance? I mean, I understand all your legal arguments. There were two and a half pages of mitigation evidence. The prosecution gets up and says this is a perfect guy, there's no history of mental health, there's no mitigation on substance abuse. The prosecutor at trial points to the deficits of mitigation investigation that trial counsel has done. We hear from the investigator that he's hired. He's told to investigate. And less than a month before trial, he starts trying to do things and fails completely, as Justice Ginsburg points out, to do even the basics of investigation, trying to get school records, that had nothing to do with not reaching the parents or not; not talking to a witness in California, where this man lived and worked for a long period of time; nowhere in Texas, because he had been there for a period of time. All of those things suggest to me deficient performance. You have a lot of legal defenses, but how can you stand here and say that this kind of investigation meets any constitutional standard? Did we create a meaningless right in Martinez/Trevino? Because that's what you're arguing, which is it's nice to have a hearing and get past the procedural bar, but all of the things that an effective counsel should have done, and we've now found they weren't, no record has been created. Martinez/Trevino, we said that that was the failing that we were remedying, the fact that a defendant has not been given one clear chance to fully develop a record and make his claim. Is that your suggestion? When? Trevino was an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. But isn't Martinez/Trevino suggesting the very essence of the exception to that rule, which is if you've not been given a chance, a fair chance to have some court decide your claim, then you haven't been represented. I don't know what is more attorney abandonment than that. To have one fair chance at having a claim reviewed. ",do you do you believe that the statute can be read to mean that a district court even if it find reasonable necessity that it have the authority not to award fee and what would those be and what if a judge exercise that discretion improperly so you believe it be appealable but under an abuse of discretion standard now do you think that that include an attorney that be not the fact of your case i i know that in your case the defendant himself to the first investigator who interview him say he have have head trauma and and some dependency and by the time the request for investigative service come about he have already have a schizophrenic episode but how about a case where there be no evidence whatsoever of dependency andor of any mental illness mental challenge whatever you want to call it can an attorney come in and say it be common practice to do this so i want to do it anyway even though there be no suggestion in the record that this be a fruitful inquiry so where do you go if a circuit be arbitrarily and capriciously say we be not go to give any fund period you be go to tell me that will not happen but during the financial crisis not so long ago they have a reason but whether that take care of your right to counsel and counsel that have the resource to do the work necessary to represent you be a different question a constitutional question so what happen in that situation where do the defendant go by the way in which way be this outside of the judicial branch i mean i understand our prior case where we we be ask to review a claim and it then go to the secretary of the treasury who have absolute discretion to grant the claim or not that go outside the judiciary but how do this go outside the judiciary well we also know that those thing do not get record make but here this be require by statute to be put to be make a part of the record potential what you put thing to be on the record but I be sorry the fifth circuit do not rely on that ground neither have you below so we reach out to a totally new question in which there be no circuit split and answer that question well I be not sure it be open after martinez and trevino give the nature of our language in those decision but that be a merit issue on the question but have say that why do we reach it so counsel he do counsel how can you justify say there be not deficient trial performance i mean i understand all your legal argument there we be two and a half page of mitigation evidence the prosecution get up and say this be a perfect guy there be no history of mental health there be no mitigation on substance abuse the prosecutor at trial point to the deficit of mitigation investigation that trial counsel have do we hear from the investigator that he have hire he be tell to investigate and less than a month before trial he start try to do thing and fails completely as justice ginsburg point out to do even the basic of investigation try to get school record that have nothing to do with not reach the parent or not not talk to a witness in california where this man live and work for a long period of time nowhere in texas because he have be there for a period of time all of those thing suggest to me deficient performance you have a lot of legal defense but how can you stand here and say that this kind of investigation meet any constitutional standard do we create a meaningless right in martineztrevino because that be what you be argue which be it be nice to have a hearing and get past the procedural bar but all of the thing that an effective counsel should have do and we have now find they be not no record have be create martineztrevino we say that that be the failing that we we be remedy the fact that a defendant have not be give one clear chance to fully develop a record and make his claim be that your suggestion when trevino be an ineffective assistance of counsel claim but be not martineztrevino suggest the very essence of the exception to that rule which be if you have not be give a chance a fair chance to have some court decide your claim then you have not be represent i do not know what be more attorney abandonment than that to have one fair chance at have a claim review ,327.9600000000001,Roberts Court,"Oct 30, 2017",Carlos Manuel Ayestas,"Lorie Davis, Director, Texas Department of Criminal Justice (Institutional Division)",16-6795,"Apr 3, 2017","Mar 21, 2018",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2017,Trump v. Hawaii,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I'm sorry, Mr. -- General. I thought that Congress had looked at the situation and created a statutory system that addressed the very concern the President is expressing. Congress said you can have visa waivers if you -- if you can meet the three criteria that this special committee of the President looked at, and if you don't, you have to have a very heightened, extreme vetting process. And it created that vetting process and suggested its parameters. More importantly, it took terrorist countries and designated which ones supported terrorism and added another layer of review and said, if you're a national from one of those countries or you have visited one of those countries in the recent past, you also have to get the permission of the Attorney General and the Secretary of State to -- to affirm that you are not a danger to the U.S. So I -- but what I see the President doing here is saying, I'm going to add more to the limits that Congress set -- -- and to what Congress said was enough. Where does a President get the authority to do more than Congress has already decided is adequate? But -- it might, but -- -- on the very grounds that Congress has already looked at? Can you represent that no other country that -- that fails all three of the criteria was excluded from this list? So given -- General, the proclamations by Reagan and Carter, however, were not as broad as this one. And -- and -- And more -- and more immigrants, because Carter's only applied to certain immigrants, not to all. Mr. General, you just -- Why not an Establishment Clause claim? No, but the claim is that it -- that the proclamation is in place because of a dislike of a particular religion. And I thought the Establishment Clause at its heart is that we cannot be anything but neutral with respect to religion or its practice. But these people are saying that that negative religious attitude is stopping them -- -- from doing things that they would otherwise be able to do: To associate with scholars from these countries, to bring in students, to have family members join them. Which is one of the purposes of the INS. Well, but I -- General, today, can we go back to something that's been bothering me here, which is -- and it was argued in a case this week about the unitary executive theory, which basically says the President is at the head, I think -- I'm summarizing in an incomplete way -- -- but that the President is the head of the executive branch and that he should have, for those who are in the extreme of this theory or -- or on one end of the theory -- -- not extreme, that he can hire or fire anyone he wants and that he can put in place whatever policy he wants. If we take Justice Kagan's hypothetical President -- -- who basically says to his review committee, I want to keep out Jews -- -- period; find a way. That's their charge. So, in that situation, why would the actions of the committee, whatever this is, Executive Committee, not be subject to great suspicion and to thorough review -- which actually wasn't completely -- -- done here -- given that they are responsible to the executive -- -- and they've been told what the outcome of their deliberations must be? General, the problem is that I don't see that that material was reviewed by the judges below, by the Ninth Circuit or the Fourth Circuit judges. I thought that the government had kept confidential and refused to share, either with the litigants or the courts, exactly what was done, how, what the evaluation and how -- -- it was applied to all those countries in the world. I understand some of the confidentiality that might concern you, but if the backdrop is the way that Justice Kagan described it -- -- that -- that heated -- -- anti-Semitic background, don't you think that once you get through the Mandel preliminary stage, that you need an independent arbiter to look at all of that to ensure the process, in fact, is what is claimed it was? So if another -- Mr. Katyal, you said something earlier, you said you wouldn't be here if all of those statements, the background statements, were not made. Do you mean that on all of your bases? You wouldn't be here on the Establishment Clause claim? So let's -- let's go back to not being here without the statements. Clearly, the statements, even conceded by your adversary, do give you a basis to look behind, all right, the reason. So, if we're looking behind it, how do you deal with the General's suggestion that there was a cleansing that occurred because of all of the agencies and departments who participated in this process? General, could you stop just one second? I for one am, like Justice Breyer, concerned about is this window dressing or not? What's in place to ensure it's not? What are you personally doing to represent to us that it is, in fact, a real waiver process -- Have you bothered -- -- to look to see if there are reasons for all of those people's exclusions? ",I be sorry mr general i think that congress have look at the situation and create a statutory system that address the very concern the president be express congress say you can have visa waiver if you if you can meet the three criterion that this special committee of the president look at and if you do not you have to have a very heighten extreme vet process and it create that vet process and suggest its parameter more importantly it take terrorist country and designate which one support terrorism and add another layer of review and say if you be a national from one of those country or you have visit one of those country in the recent past you also have to get the permission of the attorney general and the secretary of state to to affirm that you be not a danger to the us so i but what i see the president do here be say I be go to add more to the limit that congress set and to what congress say be enough where do a president get the authority to do more than congress have already decide be adequate but it might but on the very ground that congress have already look at can you represent that no other country that that fail all three of the criterion be exclude from this list so give general the proclamation by reagan and carter however we be not as broad as this one and and and more and more immigrant because carter s only apply to certain immigrant not to all mr general you just why not an establishment clause claim no but the claim be that it that the proclamation be in place because of a dislike of a particular religion and i think the establishment clause at its heart be that we can not be anything but neutral with respect to religion or its practice but these people be say that that negative religious attitude be stop them from do thing that they would otherwise be able to do to associate with scholar from these country to bring in student to have family member join them which be one of the purpose of the in well but i general today can we go back to something that be be bother me here which be and it be argue in a case this week about the unitary executive theory which basically say the president be at the head i think I be summarize in an incomplete way but that the president be the head of the executive branch and that he should have for those who be in the extreme of this theory or or on one end of the theory not extreme that he can hire or fire anyone he want and that he can put in place whatever policy he want if we take justice kagan s hypothetical president who basically say to his review committee i want to keep out jew period find a way that be their charge so in that situation why would the action of the committee whatever this be executive committee not be subject to great suspicion and to thorough review which actually be not completely do here give that they be responsible to the executive and they have be tell what the outcome of their deliberation must be general the problem be that i do not see that that material be review by the judge below by the ninth circuit or the fourth circuit judge i think that the government have keep confidential and refuse to share either with the litigant or the court exactly what be do how what the evaluation and how it be apply to all those country in the world i understand some of the confidentiality that might concern you but if the backdrop be the way that justice kagan describe it that that heat anti semitic background do not you think that once you get through the mandel preliminary stage that you need an independent arbiter to look at all of that to ensure the process in fact be what be claim it be so if another mr katyal you say something earlier you say you would not be here if all of those statement the background statement we be not make do you mean that on all of your base you would not be here on the establishment clause claim so let us let us go back to not be here without the statement clearly the statement even concede by your adversary do give you a basis to look behind all right the reason so if we be look behind it how do you deal with the general s suggestion that there be a cleansing that occur because of all of the agency and department who participate in this process general could you stop just one second i for one be like justice breyer concern about be this window dress or not what be in place to ensure it be not what be you personally do to represent to us that it be in fact a real waiver process have you bother to look to see if there be reason for all of those people s exclusion ,394.99000000000007,Roberts Court,"Apr 25, 2018","Donald J.

2017,"Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, Council 31",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I'm sorry, I thought that we had always recognized that the government as employer had a compelling interest in regulating its employment decisions. We permit the government to fire people, deprive them of all money, not just a fair share fee, but deprive them of any income if they speak outside of the government's approved policy messages or messages generally. So, if we can permit the government as employer to have a compelling interest to do something as dramatic as firing someone, why can't that interest in having workplace peace, workplace routine in which issues are decided in a -- in a collective way, why isn't that a compelling interest comparable to the others? But that's no different than forcing student -- student participation in fees to provide a public forum, to have a bar association regulated. These are all forcing the subsidization of private interests for a government purpose. And the government purpose here is labor relations and labor peace. Why isn't -- you still haven't told me why that's not a compelling state interest. Or -- I shouldn't say state. A compelling federal -- government interest. Well, there's another way of doing student fees. You can have students who don't pay not participate in any student activity because the price of -- of being permitted to participate. You can have bar associations that the state runs. You can have alternatives of all kinds, but the question is, is the alternative that the state has chosen one that is well-fitted to the -- to its need? Is it well-tailored, narrowly tailored? I don't see how you can do that given the interests of the government in ensuring that unions represent everybody. Why not? You have free riding. Is it just the collective nature of the union? You're not suggesting that if an employee goes to the state and tries to negotiate his or her wages that that's a First Amendment activity. We've said it's not, right? That employment-related issues are not entitled to First Amendment protection, correct? So, if an employee is disciplined by the state for some malfeasance, that's an employment-related issue not entitled to First Amendment protection? Oftentimes. If employees come to the union -- come to the state and want greater training, employment issue, correct? So why does it transform into some entitlement to First Amendment protection merely because a collective body of employees are coming to the table at once? What -- what's the transformative nature now of making these substantive questions matters of public policy? It's not going to change whether the union asks for it or the employees come -- what you're now saying is if the employees came into an auditorium at a business site of the state and every one of them got up and said, I want higher wages, the scale of that demand makes it protected by the First Amendment? It's still a work-related demand. Well, let's -- let's not -- don't put in facts. They have permission to be in the auditorium. They walk in as a group. Every one of them gets up and says, I want higher wages. Is that an employment issue, or does that now become public policy because, something that every employee wants, they've now articulated? So it's now scale, not subject? Scale -- We also have more benefits that are given without unions. Well, that may be a different one, but doesn't that beg the question, Mr. General, about not having a record here? There's an awful lot of assumptions that have been bandied back and forth by both sides on the actual effects of this. You're saying it's okay because the federal government's the same, the Postal Service is like other jobs, but that -- that's a whole lot of allegations about the reality, factual reality -- -- of things that have not been tested anywhere. How much of the workplace -- How much of the workplace is unionized for the federal government? And how much is their unionization in the general corporate sector? Or private sector? In the mechanical industry, in the printing industry, in -- I know a lot of industries -- -- that are controlled by union. I don't mean that in a negative sense. Meaning that almost all work -- I'm sorry. If we're going to get into scope under the Pickering test, then the employee who, contrary to the chain of command, talks about rampant corruption in a government agency, then we're not going to permit, as we already have, that employee to be fired because the scope of that affects the public fisc in a huge way. I -- I -- I don't understand what you're arguing. This is such a radical new position on your part. Mr. -- Mr. General, by the way, how many times this term already have you flipped positions from prior administrations? This may be -- how many? Counsel, what is there -- what is there about compelled speech? I mean, our line has drawn a big difference between compelled speech and compelled subsidy. And -- and we've compelled people to pay bar associations so long as you're not compelled or stopped from speaking when you disagree. We've said that's a compelled subsidy. Bar members can come out any day they want and say they don't take the same position on a policy question as the bar association. Any union member is free to get up publicly in any setting he or she wants to say they don't agree with the position the union is taking, correct? You're basically arguing do away with unions, because you're really taking, in essence, and saying every single employee decision is really a public policy decision. I have an individual person I want to fire or discipline. You just said it's a public policy question. But grievances don't deal with one issue. Every grievance has a different issue. Some people are disciplined for being late. Some people are disciplined for a workplace disruption. Some for -- -- violating a dozen other workplace rules. As Justice -- -- Breyer said, every single decision affects the public fisc. Every time you lose something, you -- the public fisc is affected. You're talking -- ",I be sorry i think that we have always recognize that the government as employer have a compelling interest in regulate its employment decision we permit the government to fire people deprive them of all money not just a fair share fee but deprive them of any income if they speak outside of the government s approved policy message or message generally so if we can permit the government as employer to have a compelling interest to do something as dramatic as fire someone why can not that interest in have workplace peace workplace routine in which issue be decide in a in a collective way why be not that a compelling interest comparable to the others but that be no different than force student student participation in fee to provide a public forum to have a bar association regulate these be all force the subsidization of private interest for a government purpose and the government purpose here be labor relation and labor peace why be not you still have not tell me why that be not a compelling state interest or i should not say state a compelling federal government interest well there be another way of do student fee you can have student who do not pay not participate in any student activity because the price of of be permit to participate you can have bar association that the state run you can have alternative of all kind but the question be be the alternative that the state have choose one that be well fit to the to its need be it well tailor narrowly tailor i do not see how you can do that give the interest of the government in ensure that union represent everybody why not you have free riding be it just the collective nature of the union you be not suggest that if an employee go to the state and try to negotiate his or her wage that that be a first amendment activity we have say it be not right that employment relate issue be not entitle to first amendment protection correct so if an employee be discipline by the state for some malfeasance that be an employment relate issue not entitle to first amendment protection oftentimes if employee come to the union come to the state and want great training employment issue correct so why do it transform into some entitlement to first amendment protection merely because a collective body of employee be come to the table at once what what be the transformative nature now of make these substantive question matter of public policy it be not go to change whether the union ask for it or the employee come what you be now say be if the employee come into an auditorium at a business site of the state and every one of them get up and say i want high wage the scale of that demand make it protect by the first amendment it be still a work related demand well let us let us not do not put in fact they have permission to be in the auditorium they walk in as a group every one of them get up and say i want high wage be that an employment issue or do that now become public policy because something that every employee want they have now articulate so it be now scale not subject scale we also have more benefit that be give without union well that may be a different one but do not that beg the question mr general about not have a record here there be an awful lot of assumption that have be bandy back and forth by both side on the actual effect of this you be say it be okay because the federal government s the same the postal service be like other job but that that be a whole lot of allegation about the reality factual reality of thing that have not be test anywhere how

2017,"Lozman v. City of Riviera Beach, Florida",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"The -- Do you recommend that? In your case. But is it a good rule? Meaning -- If we do away with Devenpeck, though, as -- if I remember here, the -- the sergeant, I think, or whomever initially looked at the case said there is grounds for probable cause, but we're not going to get a conviction, so that's why we're not going to proceed. Now the judge said there's no probable cause on the facts as they existed, but you can well imagine that officers filled with animus could scour the books at the booking station and they could look for something that might fit the day as well but still not have been something they would have otherwise arrested for. He was on topic. Assume that fact. He started by saying there's been an arrest for corruption, which was true. And then he tried to say: And I've been telling you that other people are corrupt. Why is that off topic? I'm sorry, though, that -- But I'm sorry, we don't -- we don't disagree that police officers shouldn't be arresting for retaliatory intent. All right. Now, if we accept that premise that the First Amendment is valuable enough to us to protect it from government abuse and -- and the facts in this case, that's what they assumed or that's what we're assuming from the facts as alleged, shouldn't we have a remedy and shouldn't we have a remedy that takes care of those arrests that are motivated solely because of animus, because Mt. Healthy says if you would have arrested anyway, you're not liable. But what you're doing is depriving people who would not have been arrested except for their First Amendment speech from having any remedy whatsoever. Now I know you say something else will take care of it, but the reality is something else usually doesn't take care of it. No. I'm not even talking about an epidemic. I'm talking about a constitutional wrong, because either way you're saying we shouldn't create a system for this kind of violation, but why should I create a system to exempt this from our regular First Amendment process, because there might be one or a few cases that fall through the protective barriers that Ms. Karlan pointed to? No, there's no remedy -- Sorry. I did go through the list that the Alaska brief formed and the six that you -- that you listed. It seems to me that having read those cases, that they went to trial not because those limitations failed but because there was other evidence of things that -- that -- that didn't fail but made this triable cases. Many of them involved excessive force claims, which can often be reflective of animus in a different way than a mere arrest is. And as was pointed out by your adversary, of the 26 the Alaska brief pointed to, 12 of them were dismissed at the motion to dismiss stage. So people bring things, but it doesn't mean that they're viable.

2017,Patchak v. Zinke,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counselor -- Counselor, can I -- I want to switch from personal jurisdiction to sovereign immunity, in part for the reasons that the Chief is -- Chief Justice is talking about. Okay? In Patchak I, I took the position that the Court got sovereign immunity wrong, and basically I argued -- the majority disagreed -- that -- that the Quiet Title Act really granted immunity. And the majority disagreed and said this had to do with APA waiver of immunity. I look at statutory history and this new act, the Reaffirmation Act, was in the context of that dispute in that case. And what Congress did was settle the question, which I believe it's entitled to do and is not unconstitutional, it ratified the acts of the Secretary's taking of this land, and by that act, implicated the Quiet Title Act. And so, if it did that, I see this -- and I don't understand why it's not, that waiver of sovereign immunity that the Court did not recognize in Patchak I. And I raise this for two reasons: One, I do think there's a difference between the Congress coming in between two private parties and directing a result in favor of one private party. I think that's a quintessential separation-of-powers question and a very, very serious one. But I think there is something fundamentally different about suits involving the government because sovereign immunity -- or any suit against the government is a matter only of largesse and -- and the government's voluntary choice. We have repeatedly through the centuries said the government can at any moment take away its sovereign immunity. It can take away that niceness of giving you the immunity. So I see the potential of less of a problem with separation of powers if -- if the government has withdrawn sovereign immunity than it directing the outcome between private parties. I would be really frightened if we let the government do that. But -- so, given that statutory history, the only issue that was left alive or was at issue in Patchak I, given that the waiver of sovereign immunity that was taken away tracks the APA language, the APA's language says that a suit can be maintained against the government, why isn't this a sovereign immunity case? Why am I dealing with personal jurisdiction at all or separation-of-powers questions at all? We've never said it had to. All of the statutory history indicia. The whole fight in Patchak I was over the existence or non-existence of sovereign immunity. I'm sorry. Can you tell me what other actions in your judgment, besides this one, could be or would be filed relating to the land? Would a slip-and-fall no longer be permissible? But any suit like that would be way past the statute of limitations. Who -- who could even bring it? ",counselor counselor can i i want to switch from personal jurisdiction to sovereign immunity in part for the reason that the chief be chief justice be talk about okay in patchak i i take the position that the court get sovereign immunity wrong and basically i argue the majority disagree that that the quiet title act really grant immunity and the majority disagreed and say this have to do with apa waiver of immunity i look at statutory history and this new act the reaffirmation act be in the context of that dispute in that case and what congress do be settle the question which i believe it be entitle to do and be not unconstitutional it ratify the act of the secretary s taking of this land and by that act implicate the quiet title act and so if it do that i see this and i do not understand why it be not that waiver of sovereign immunity that the court do not recognize in patchak i and i raise this for two reason one i do think there be a difference between the congress come in between two private party and direct a result in favor of one private party i think that be a quintessential separation of power question and a very very serious one but i think there be something fundamentally different about suit involve the government because sovereign immunity or any suit against the government be a matter only of largesse and and the government s voluntary choice we have repeatedly through the century say the government can at any moment take away its sovereign immunity it can take away that niceness of give you the immunity so i see the potential of less of a problem with separation of power if if the government have withdraw sovereign immunity than it direct the outcome between private party i would be really frightened if we let the government do that but so give that statutory history the only issue that be leave alive or be at issue in patchak i give that the waiver of sovereign immunity that be take away track the apa language the apa s language say that a suit can be maintain against the government why be not this a sovereign immunity case why be i deal with personal jurisdiction at all or separation of power question at all we have never say it have to all of the statutory history indicia the whole fight in patchak i be over the existence or non existence of sovereign immunity I be sorry can you tell me what other action in your judgment besides this one could be or would be file relate to the land would a slip and fall no longer be permissible but any suit like that would be way past the statute of limitation who who could even bring it ,232.48,Roberts Court,"Nov 7, 2017",David Patchak,"Ryan Zinke, Sec. of Interior",16-498,"May 1, 2017","Feb 27, 2018",113.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1

I don't understand the necessity, meaning if we had only (a)(1), the court could do exactly what you're saying as well. It didn't need (a)(2) to accomplish what (a)(1) already says it can. It suggests to me that there's a separate purpose for (a)(2). How is this different from a case in which a plaintiff brings multiple claims, not all of them directly related? And in that situation, if there's a partial entry of judgment on one of the claims, you can't appeal. How is this different? One lawsuit with multiple claims.

For example, one among the many officers said he smelled marijuana, but, as I understand it, no drugs were found, correct? Not marijuana or any other. Why weren't the people who were suspected of engaging in sex arrested? Why weren't the people standing around the strippers arrested for those activities, if they were illegal? But they weren't charged with those crimes. What -- what was that? If all it had, according to you, was a bed and some folding chairs and utilities that worked, nothing had been turned off, what happens during a party? Disarray? So what was different in this disarray from a party? I'm sorry, what's the falsity? Mr. Kim, I don't know if I agree completely with your opposing counsel that the wealth of the neighborhood should make a difference, but I suspect that if police officers arrived at a wealthy home and it was white teenagers having a party, and one of them says, ""my dad just bought this house,"" that it would be very -- and I told the kids they could have a party, and it became, Joe told me to come, and Larry King told me to come, and X King told me to come, that those kids wouldn't be arrested. Maybe the kid who lied might be, but I doubt very much those kids would be arrested. So, how is this case different? Same set of facts: Sparsely furnished, even a little bit dirty, lights are on, that sort of thing. So shouldn't we have a rule that if we're going to require mens rea at all, that police officers should be treating people equally? Twenty one people en masse arrested for trespassing for going to a party. Does that feel right? Peaches had keys. If those partygoers -- well, we know there wasn't forced entry.

2017,Sveen v. Melin,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"On the basis of what? Where in the record? Where in the record is the basis for their empirical finding? Could you just -- Could you tell me, what are the various ways that a -- an insured who wants to keep his former wife as the beneficiary, what would he have to do after the divorce? I know he could -- the divorce decree could say yes or no. What other ways could the insured -- No, let's assume he doesn't want to. How does the insurance company know that there has been a divorce so that they receive the letter and sort of go: Why is he doing this? We already have that beneficiary. So we have a Supreme Court case because there was an ineffective attorney? My problem with the police power argument you're making is that I don't think it stands alone, meaning you can think that the state has a greater interest in certain areas like divorce or others, regulated fields like mineral, et cetera, but I don't think that state police power gives unbounded discretion to the state. To some extent, it's intermixed with what's the state's purpose and is it a legitimate thing it's doing. Well, that goes back to Justice Gorsuch's question, could the state say, upon divorce, I'm giving the money to the state or I'm giving it to a charity, et cetera? And you said yes, but I wasn't quite sure why. It seems to me that, even under state power, you have to be able to articulate some fit between the need and the solution. I'm sorry, judges do what they do as a result of laws, meaning they don't just decide to redistribute insurance proceeds out of the kindness of their heart or -- or -- they do it because there's a specific law that gives them the right to do that. So I'm not sure what the difference is. If the law is compelling it or the law is permitting it, then it's the judge as well as the law. I'm sorry, it takes away an express term of the contract. It does away with the contract. You fail to record, you get no protection. Here, you get a beneficiary, one you've designated as an alternative, so you get somebody. The money's paid. That's a lot better than having your rights revoked completely. But that goes back to Justice Gorsuch's point, which is we look at the nature of the impairment, how difficult is it to do whatever is being changed. And there's a big difference between producing something you may have lost 20 years before and writing a letter to an insurance company or including it in your divorce decree or doing something else. It doesn't cost you much to do.

2017,Upper Skagit Indian Tribe v. Lundgren,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, can I just ask a question about the immovable property argument which was just raised in the merits brief here. If you had more time, what more would you argue to us? What more could you show us to prove that you were right that this is not a part of the common law?

Counsel, I -- I fully accept that they only raise this in their merits brief. I'm asking you a very directed question. What other research would you do that could help you prove your argument? I'm sorry, I'm actually quite interested in that because I went to look. There is a split on Yakima and what Yakima means or doesn't mean. But I don't know that the courts below have been looking at this immovable property theory. So -- -- if we let it go back, it's going to get aired fully and we'll have a split -- -- according to you. Might or might not have a split. That would require us to take the case again on this theory, but it still doesn't explain why we shouldn't follow our normal practice and just say relying on Yakima is wrong, and there might be something else, but, you know, you'll take care of it -- -- in that first instance. Mr. Miller, I -- I -- you argue forcefully and you argue intelligently, but I don't know why if it was so obvious to everyone, and you didn't author the brief in opposition to certiorari, but if it was so obvious that this was the case, why doesn't the brief mention the immovable property exception?

Why would parties run to the courthouse? They would either wait for an enforcement proceeding or wait for a denial of a permit or just wait, and the waiting would then result in the inefficiencies that the Chief Justice just pointed to. Even worse, because we would have a rule being constantly challenged and never truly finalized. Let me ask you something. Is -- I don't think there's any res judicata against the government, or is there? Would a -- would a -- or collateral estoppel, it wouldn't be res judicata, could there be collateral estoppel? So should we make -- Should we make sense of it? Meaning the government's position at least with respect to (E) is very simple. Once you define navigable waters, you say where an effluent limitation applies or doesn't. And so that's an effluent limitation. It's attractive, simple. Certainly no more complex than your position in terms of its consequences. So -- But we have -- But it doesn't swallow up enforcement actions. It doesn't swallow up the Army Corps permitting. There are some very big areas that it doesn't swallow up. Could you just give me one moment, because you just mentioned the limitations. Give me your interpretation of effluent limitation or other limitation. What would other -- give me concrete examples of what would be an other limitation so that the two terms are not redundant? Give me an example, concrete example. So give meaning to the word ""limitation."" Well, because you're basically buying into the government's argument that it's anything related to -- -- effluent limitation. Are -- So, basically, you agree with your adversary that -- that ""other limitation"" means any limitation? Is there any -- otherwise, what limitations don't exist? Of any limitation? All right. So just realistically, is it possible this case would be mooted this term or is this process one that innately will take longer than this term? I -- I'm sorry. Perhaps you can focus in. What would be the difference? Let's assume we say this goes to the court of appeals and the court of appeals says, whatever, the rule is okay. Now an enforcement action comes in and someone, some farmer says I don't -- I shouldn't fit under this rule because this really can't be navigable waters. What happens then? Does the court say, well, that was litigated or should have been litigated before, so we're just not going to pay attention to this challenge? But we do have confusion just in this case. There was a circuit and district court split. So something about our rule is not clear. So tell me what we do to make it clear. How do we -- -- explain this to the courts below so that they have a clearer idea of what it is that's in and what's out? That has to do with whether it imposes a limitation on any of the words of 1311. Because that's how you limited it before. Discharge of any pollutant in navigable waters.

2017,"U.S. Bank National Association v. Village at Lakeridge, LLC",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"It's two prongs, that means -- let's assume the district court had found that this couple was an intimate couple that lived together, exchanged payments of their expenses, were like a married couple. Not like the facts found. But, in fact, they transacted this in an arm's length way. He did due diligence. He -- he thought about it. He talked to investors. They all said this is a great deal; take it. So it has the indicia of arm's length, but it is almost an insider relationship because he's essentially married to this woman. That's fascinating. It seemed -- it's not required with traditional statutory insiders. With statutory insiders, we presume that the transaction is tinged. Why don't we make the same presumption if these -- if these non-statutory insiders are just like insiders? You asked us to take this as a question presented, and we denied it. So why did you think it was important if you're defending the standard now? Why did you ask us to take the question if you think the standard is okay? You're living with it. It -- it's more blunt than that, because the lower court said that there was diligence appropriate to the amount of the investment. So that does sound like a factual finding, which is: it was due under the circumstances. You -- you have an awful lot of strong arguments in this case on the facts, but it still doesn't answer why this is not a finding of fact as opposed to a conclusion of law, because when he says this was diligence enough for a $5,000 investment, to me, that sounds like a quintessential fact finding. How am I supposed to know that as a judge? I think it's better left in the hands of a bankruptcy judge who deals with financial transactions all the time. I don't think he is. He articulated his test very simply. He wants the circuit court to say what the legal standard is. What does closeness mean? And I guess -- I mean, he may add some tweaks to it, but I think he would say closeness is a relationship that is not between strangers, that you have a friendship, a romantic or otherwise, but it's not between two strangers. And arm's length is a transaction in which there hasn't been a market deal, where -- a market deal being supply and demand, and someone's actually done due diligence on what they are demanding. It seems that that seems like pure questions of law to me. And what he's saying is that's what the circuit court didn't do here. It didn't define in any meaningful way what closeness means or what arm's length means. Even as a Black's Law Dictionary definition or as a subsidiary definition, it didn't give any guidance. So why aren't -- why isn't that questions of law? So closeness is irrelevant? It's just whether it's arm's length and the lack of arm's length defines closeness? But you know something -- -- clear error shouldn't be a pass. There are errors. And some of them are clear. And so why isn't this one of those cases? That's what Judge Clifton was saying, which is on these facts you can't sustain a finding of arm's length transaction or a finding that there was a lack of closeness. That -- so even under that standard, there has to be some meaning to what those two things mean and some explanation as to why that -- this fits that. What else? No, they go into a bidding war. I would have been the very first one going back and forth and saying who's going to pay me the highest amount? May -- may I ask you that question? He paid $5,000 with no diligence. He didn't know what the return on that could or could not be. How come it's an arm's length transaction if the only way he makes his money back is voting for the cramdown plan? Meaning, doesn't he -- isn't he self-interested by definition when he's buying something that depends totally on him voting with the company? Because he doesn't get paid at all if he doesn't vote for -- with the company's cramdown.

Its business was to sell products, to sell its services, your point, abroad or anywhere in the world where it could. And it wasn't going to ship the part.

2017,Lagos v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Why not? Meaning, it is a proceeding, bankruptcy. It's related to the offense. The bankruptcy was caused by the offense essentially. And they attended through a representative. So why aren't those recoverable? Is there something -- Are the expenses for bankruptcy here related to the work of the attorneys or the attendance of corporate officers at the hearing? You have to read the investigation or prosecution -- you have to read them together, not singularly. Actually, that does happen the reverse way. There are times the police get information and they go to the company. I think it's a closer call on whether in that situation -- and if they ask the company to look into something it wasn't aware of, whether that's participation. Putting that aside, it doesn't necessarily follow that an investigation by a company always precedes the prosecution. The typical way is the government prosecutes -- investigates. So what do I do with the fact that statutes of restitution passed at an identical time to this statute used your words, used the words: The victim's entitled to the damages proximately caused by the offense. Yet Congress here, instead of using those very simple and direct words that would cover everything that's happened here, decided to break it up into four categories and very specifically told courts what those categories encompass. There's a recent proposal that's being considered now, I think it's by either the Sentencing Commission or some congressional committee, that's saying should we change this statute and all the others to simply say ""make the victim whole."" They would get to where you're going very directly. So what do I do with those differences? I have -- I think I have to give different meaning to different statutory terms that were passed at the identical time. That's what those other statutes said. All right. I -- Let -- let's say we -- I'm sorry. Go ahead. I'm sorry -- -- the fraud here was $25 million? And how much was spent that was awarded by the court below in restitution? Was it 10 or $15 million? But the full amount was, to collect 25, they spent 15. Does the judge decide what's necessary at what point? I see, okay. Which were how much? Together -- -- it's more than that. Maybe my memory has them -- That's what I thought. Is the criminal -- I'm sorry. May I ask you a question about the criminal conviction? Can it be used to prove liability in the -- in a civil suit? All right. So that means that a corporation, which, as Justice Kagan pointed out, corporate losses of these kind are not specified anywhere in this provision. They can go into civil court. Liability is taken as a given. All they have to do is prove their restitution amount. Correct? So tell me why Congress would have been worried about that when it seemed more worried about the individual expenses that people are unlikely to go to civil court for. They're entitled to their losses, but you're asking for something more than what's specified here, according to your adversary. Yes, except that Congress, unlike other provisions that specified attorneys' fees, putting the victim whole, proximate causation, Congress in -- instead chose very specific categories here. This company you told me earlier got $15 million back without the government. It wasn't the government who helped them do that. It was themselves. Did your client point that out to the district court judge here? ",why not meaning it be a proceeding bankruptcy it be relate to the offense the bankruptcy be cause by the offense essentially and they attend through a representative so why be not those recoverable be there something be the expense for bankruptcy here relate to the work of the attorney or the attendance of corporate officer at the hearing you have to read the investigation or prosecution you have to read them together not singularly actually that do happen the reverse way there be time the police get information and they go to the company i think it be a close call on whether in that situation and if they ask the company to look into something it be not aware of whether that be participation put that aside it do not necessarily follow that an investigation by a company always precede the prosecution the typical way be the government prosecute investigates so what do i do with the fact that statute of restitution pass at an identical time to this statute use your word use the word the victim s entitle to the damage proximately cause by the offense yet congress here instead of use those very simple and direct word that would cover everything that be happen here decide to break it up into four category and very specifically tell court what those category encompass there be a recent proposal that be be consider now i think it be by either the sentence commission or some congressional committee that be say should we change this statute and all the others to simply say make the victim whole they would get to where you be go very directly so what do i do with those difference i have i think i have to give different meaning to different statutory term that we be pass at the identical time that be what those other statute say all right i let let us say we I be sorry go ahead I be sorry the fraud here be million and how much be spend that be award by the court below in restitution be it or million but the full amount be to collect they spend do the judge decide what be necessary at what point i see okay which we be how much together it be more than that maybe my memory have them that be what i thought be the criminal I be sorry may i ask you a question about the criminal conviction can it be use to prove liability in the in a civil suit all right so that mean that a corporation which as justice kagan point out corporate loss of these kind be not specify anywhere in this provision they can go into civil court liability be take as a give all they have to do be prove their restitution amount correct so tell me why congress would have be worry about that when it seem more worried about the individual expense that people be unlikely to go to civil court for they be entitle to their loss but you be ask for something more than what be specify here accord to your adversary yes except that congress unlike other provision that specify attorney fee put the victim whole proximate causation congress in instead chose very specific category here this company you tell me early get million back without the government it be not the government who help them do that it be themselves do your client point that out to the district court judge here ,234.79999999999995,Roberts Court,"Apr 18, 2018",Sergio Fernando Lagos,United States,16-1519,"Jan 12, 2018","May 29, 2018",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2017,Rubin v. Islamic Republic of Iran,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Magic words under (a) and (b). In 1610 in (a) and (b), Congress knew how directly to say property is not or is subject, immune from attachment. But it used something very different here. Rather, it says that property is, quote, ""subject to attachment as provided in this section."" Those are two very distinct formulations. I'm sorry. I thought that the University of Chicago had raised an interesting argument, that the definition of foreign state in the statute includes, by definition, an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state, so that the reference to foreign state that you're relying upon does include the concept of piercing the corporate veil in its very definition. Well, that -- not quite, because what -- I mean, this provision deals directly in aid of the plaintiffs in the Bancec case and in the others that had found against plaintiffs. There are at least three cases where a class of plaintiffs were found not to be in a sufficiently tied relationship to the foreign state and the plaintiffs there couldn't recover, so there was a real issue this was addressing, the fact that there were subsidiaries and agencies of foreign state who had commercial property, and it wasn't being made available to plaintiffs. Why? It gave them what those three cases denied them. It gives other plaintiffs with similar claims a lot -- access to a lot of -- of property that they wouldn't have had under Bancec. That just seems like -- -- an issue Congress has to address. And those courts may well be wrong. I don't know. Mr. Strauss, I think you were cut off on three independent reasons.

2017,"Digital Realty Trust, Inc. v. Somers",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"So can you please tell me, under your reading, what we make of subdivision (h)(1)(A)(ii)? It protects from discrimination an employee who's been fired for initiating, testifying in, or assisting in any investigation or judicial or administrative action of the Commission. Under what law is the employee who's called by the SEC after another employee reports the violation and assists the SEC in its investigation, under your reading, that employee is not protected? And I -- and I don't know that that employee is protected under the Sarbanes-Oxley provision either. The only thing that would protect that particular employee is the government's reading. And they wouldn't be covered by this act either? Well, the SC -- SEC has always been arguing -- they'll speak for themselves, but they've always been arguing that ""whistleblower"" should be given a natural reading. I'll question them on where they get that because I'm not sure there's a natural reading. But assuming I accept that proposition, isn't the fact that a natural reading would cover that second employee and potentially the third employee who is required to report internally first, isn't that reason enough because there are two provisions that would be rendered partially nugatory? To read it the government's way? I'm sorry, the -- the employer is rarely knowledgeable about the SEC filing. I believe the SEC rules require confidentiality of the filing. So virtually always an employer is going to fire someone because of internal reporting, not because of SEC reporting. Is every employee obligated by law to report a violation or is it only certain employees, lawyers and accountants and others who are affirmatively obligated to report? All right. So why would Congress want to treat lawyers and accountants to the generous provisions of the whistleblower statute when they have an obligation anyway, they're basically being incentivized to do what they're already legally obligated to do. They've got a protection, Sarbanes-Oxley. Why put them under the whistleblower statute as well? Well, that was Sarbanes-Oxley. And that's the statute Congress provided to incentivize them to do what they were legally obligated to do. Well, I see Dodd-Frank as -- as expanding the category of people, not limiting or -- or expanding it to include people who are already included. Bottom line, are you -- how much are you relying on just Chevron deference here? So why don't you give an award for that? You only give it if they report to the SEC?

2017,Koons v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"The problem really is that the guidelines are a little confusing. They talk about an initial guidelines range, and then they tell the court that the real guideline range is a statutory minimum. So that it's talking about the guidelines doesn't resolve that question because which guideline are they talking about? In my mind, they're told they have to start from the statutory minimum in their departure. So how do we get away from that fact? Yes. So that means the departure is not -- you're suggesting that the departure -- this is the -- the effect of your rule -- -- the departure starts with the lower guideline range, and then the only way they can go is down from that? Mr. Fisher, let's start with that proposition. In my experience, district court judges use a lot of different approaches to sentencing, and I think that many of the surveys and amici brief that you have show that. There are judges who have fixed rules. Perhaps they should or shouldn't. Let's not get into that, okay? But there's a wide berth of them who simply say my rule of thumb is you cooperate 50 percent. And some of them never deviate, 50 percent. How can we say that for those judges, that their sentence was based on the guidelines, so that you're entitled to eligibility? They based it on the statute -- they clearly tell you I'm basing it on the statutory minimum. But it was the -- -- guideline at the time. And -- and they have discretion to say I want to use the statutory minimum. I don't want to use the lower guideline. I'm going to ask the other side about the many judges who do use the guidelines in substantial assistance. They say it. Prosecutors by their own admission have gone in to judges and said, base it on the guidelines. So there are plenty of judges who -- who do depart based on the guidelines because they believe that they're more reflective of the seriousness of the crime and give them a better sense of how much of a departure they should or should not give. So, in those ways, it informs their decision. But we're not in that case. We're in the first type of case. Well, it is a sentencing range. That's the force of their argument, which is the sentencing range was raised to the statutory minimum. So the original judge felt bound by that sentencing range because of the statutory minimum, but that became the new guideline. It misses the next step, which the guidelines say, if you substantially cooperate, the minimum is eliminated. Mr. Feigin, you're just answering the very question, which is, you're right, there's a lot of judges, and I don't know that that's an abuse of discretion. You're already saying it's not a gross abuse of discretion or otherwise you would be appealing. So you're not doing that. It seems to me that the guidelines don't help a judge in their words to determine how much of a departure is just right, and judges have to figure that out by having some basis of comparison with something. What if the -- because they give you five factors to consider. You've got someone who does a lot on Number 1, does a little on Number 2, does a whole lot more on Number 3, and then nothing on 4. The judge mixes that all up and says: How much do I depart? And the next defendant will have a different mix, and the same question comes up. And what I see judges doing is saying the severity of this crime is measured most accurately by the guidelines. It's based on a sampling across the country of how serious this crime is. Now I'm going to take that and compare it to all of those other factors, and I'm going to decide a percentage, both based on the statutory minimum but also on the guideline, of how much seems right to me. So I -- it's not an abuse of discretion in my view. And if it's not, what do we do to ensure the equity that Mr. Fisher is calling for? Yeah, because -- -- there's different ways to get to the same reduction. Mr. Fisher, make the following assumptions. Rejecting your argument that the substantial assistance has to start from the amended guideline down, let's assume we accept the government, and the 11 circuits who have ruled this way, that it has to start from the statutory minimum. But assume further that some of those circuits have said that the court can't even consider the guideline range in determining how much of a discount to give, and that was wrong. That, as with all factors, a district court can consider what it wants in determining, for all the reasons I said earlier, how much of a discount to give can be informed by the guideline range in some way. Where would that put your clients? Because it's -- I'm not clear that -- and to be frank with you, it wasn't something I was paying attention to when I read the sentencing transcripts. A, I'm not clear that the defense attorneys in these cases below actually argued anything different than you did today, which would be rejected. That didn't raise an argument that the guide -- that they properly raised an argument that the guidelines should inform the departure from -- from the maximum. I'm sorry, all of them basically were the first type of judge I mentioned earlier, I thought virtually all of them, except that one, the judge said I give a percentage on. That clearly -- That -- that's what I said earlier -- -- which there has to be a little bit more. The question is: What are you comparing against? And what are the factors you're weighing? Mr. Fisher -- -- go to (f), because that's the strongest argument in my mind that the government has. And I know you counter by saying it's a later provision to this one. But it's a later provision in light of the circuit holding that's close to unanimous, not quite, that (e) starts from the statutory minimum. And if Congress knew enough to change (f) to exclude statutory minimum, it could have, at the very same time, done it to (e) if it disagreed with the majority of circuits. ",the problem really be that the guideline be a little confusing they talk about an initial guideline range and then they tell the court that the real guideline range be a statutory minimum so that it be talk about the guideline do not resolve that question because which guideline be they talk about in my mind they be tell they have to start from the statutory minimum in their departure so how do we get away from that fact yes so that mean the departure be not you be suggest that the departure this be the the effect of your rule the departure start with the low guideline range and then the only way they can go be down from that mr fisher let us start with that proposition in my experience district court judge use a lot of different approach to sentence and i think that many of the survey and amici brief that you have show that there be judge who have fix rule perhaps they should or should not let us not get into that okay but there be a wide berth of them who simply say my rule

want to use the low guideline I be go to ask the other side about the many judge who do use the guideline in substantial assistance they say it prosecutor by their own admission have go in to judge and say base it on the guideline so there be plenty of judge who who do depart base on the guideline because they believe that they be more reflective of the seriousness of the crime and give them a good sense of how much of a departure they should or should not give so in those way it inform their decision but we be not in that case we be in the first type of case well it be a sentencing range that be the force of their argument which be the sentence range be raise to the statutory minimum so the original judge felt bind by that sentence range because of the statutory minimum but that become the new guideline it miss the next step which the guideline say if you substantially cooperate the minimum be eliminate mr feigin you be just answer the very question which be you be right there be a lot of judge and i do not know that that be an abuse of discretion you be already say it be not a gross abuse of discretion or otherwise you would be appeal so you be not do that it seem to me that the guideline do not help a judge in their word to determine how much of a departure be just right and judge have to figure that out by have some basis of comparison with something what if the because they give you five factor to consider you have get someone who do a lot on number do a little on number do a whole lot more on number and then nothing on the judge mix that all up and say how much do i depart and the next defendant will have a different mix and the same question come up and what i see judge do be say the severity of this crime be measure most accurately by the guideline it be base on a sampling across the country of how serious this crime be now I be go to take that and compare it to all of those other factor and I be go to decide a percentage both base on the statutory minimum but also on the guideline of how much seem right to me so i it be not an abuse of discretion in my view and if it be not what do we do to ensure the equity that mr fisher be call for yeah because there have different way to get to the same reduction mr fisher make the following assumption reject your argument that the substantial assistance have to start from the amend guideline down let us assume we accept the government and the circuit who have rule this way that it have to start from the statutory minimum but assume further that some of those circuit have say that the court can

first type of judge i mention earlier i think virtually all of them except that one the judge say i give a percentage on that clearly that that be what i say earlier which there have to be a little bit more the question be what be you compare against and what be the factor you be weigh mr fisher go to f because that be the strong argument in my mind that the government have and i know you

2017,National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Can we separate -- Counsel, can you please explain to me what the difference is between the licensed and unlicensed in terms of the services? And then I have a question based on that. But you seem to be basing your argument on the point that at least the unlicensed people are not providing procedures, correct? Well, they are advertising themselves. I looked at one -- a few of them. An exemplary of this is the Fallbrook Pregnancy Resource Center website. And it's -- I'm fairly sophisticated -- there is a woman on the home page with a uniform that looks like a nurse's uniform in front of an ultrasound machine. It shows an exam room. The text of the page titled ""Abortion"" says Fallbrook will educate clients about different abortion methods available, and describe in medical terms different abortion procedures. The website also says clients will be evaluated by nurses and that they follow all HIPAA regulations, which if they're not a medical provider, they don't have to follow If a reasonable person could look at this website and think that you're giving medical advice, would the unlicensed notice be wrong? But they do provide medical advice? So let me ask you, how's that different from what a doctor does? When you go in for a pregnancy, you see the doctor, and the doctor will describe, hopefully, the benefits of a pregnancy and perhaps its risk because, depending -- not all pregnancies are without complications. So this is consulting about a medical condition. How is that any different than Casey? You come in to talk to an -- a doctor about abortion. The state says you have to tell the person the alternatives. So if you're going to choose to talk to people about -- if you're an unlicensed facility, about pregnancy, why shouldn't you tell people that you're not a doctor? So is it okay for -- is it wrong for a state to tell agencies who give advice on immigration rights -- there's a couple of states like this -- who say if you are going to give advice on immigration matters, you better tell people you're not a lawyer. Those are unconstitutional? Now you're redefining medicine. Medicine is defined by the state. You need a license to practice medicine. So if you're giving people advice about pregnancy when you are not a licensed facility, please explain to me what is both misleading, incorrect, or suggestive in any way that a person has to do something like go to this doc -- to a doctor, how is it doing anything other than telling people that, despite how the picture looks on the website, this is not a medical facility? Mr. Farris -- I'm sorry, but isn't the -- Mr. Wall, how is that different than Casey? In Casey, we require doctors to hand out state-created materials telling the women about what services the state and others provided, adoption centers, fathers had to pay things. Now I think your distinction, and you keep repeating it, is these centers, I'm assuming both the licensed and unlicensed ones, are not doing procedures. But I don't know what an ultrasound is if not a procedure. I don't know what a pregnancy test is if not a procedure. I don't know how counseling on the pregnancy state is not part of medical advice in the same way a doctor gives it when he's considering an abortion procedure. I don't understand the difference. Both of them are doing medical-related procedures, and both are being asked -- the Chief said there's a distinction in not advertising someone else's services, but in Casey, we permitted it. So please explain to me again why there's a difference here. I'm sorry -- Mr. Klein, can we go back to the question Justice Kennedy asked the other side, which was for you to affirm or disaffirm that if one of these facilities wrote an ad that just said pro-life and put their name, it appears as if the law would require them to have the statement ""This is not a medical facility"" in 48-point font? Mr. Klein, can we go back to my question? I have read the law with respect to facility, and it requires a facility to do one of -- two of four things before it qualifies under the law. So abortion -- you appear right that they have to, one, offer ultrasounds, obstetrics, sonograms, or prenatal care, pregnancy -- or pregnancy testing or diagnosis or, three, prenatal monogram tests or pregnancy and, four, collect health data. But they have to do two or more of those things. But let's go back to the question Justice Kennedy asked. One of these medical care facilities says ""pro-life"" and their name. Is that -- are they required to post a notice? And you started by answering the question, and I don't think you finished. Because they're not offering in the advertising one of these services? Would it be fair to say -- and I still don't have a full answer to my question -- all right, pro-life, nothing else, an unlicensed facility, it meets all of the criteria, has an ad that says just ""pro-life"" and puts its name. Does it have to give the notice; yes or no? That seems to me more burdensome and wrong because it's not tied to an advertisement that is promoting medical services. ",can we separate counsel can you please explain to me what the difference be between the licensed and unlicensed in term of the service and then i have a question base on that but you seem to be base your argument on the point that at least the unlicensed people be not provide procedure correct well they be advertise themselves i look at one a few of them an exemplary of this be the fallbrook pregnancy resource center website and it be I be fairly sophisticated there be a woman on the home page with a uniform that look like a nurse s uniform in front of an ultrasound machine it show an exam room the text of the page title abortion say fallbrook will educate client about different abortion method available and describe in medical term different abortion procedure the website also say client will be evaluate by nurse and that they follow all hipaa regulation which if they be not a medical provider they do not have to follow if a reasonable person could look at this website and think that you be give medical advice would the unlicensed notice be wrong but they do provide medical advice so let me ask you how be that different from what a doctor do when you go in for a pregnancy you see the doctor and the doctor will describe hopefully the benefit of a pregnancy and perhaps its risk because depend not all pregnancy be without complication so this be consult about a medical condition how be that any different than casey you come in to talk to an a doctor about abortion the state say you have to tell the person the alternative so if you be go to choose to talk to people about if you be an unlicensed facility about pregnancy why should not you tell people that you be not a doctor so be it okay for be it wrong for a state to tell agency who give advice on immigration right there be a couple of state like this who say if you be go to give advice on immigration matter you better tell people you be not a lawyer those be unconstitutional now you be redefine medicine medicine be define by the state you need a license to practice medicine so if you be give people advice about pregnancy when you be not a licensed facility please explain to me what be both misleading incorrect or suggestive in any way that a person have to do something like go to this doc to a doctor how be it do anything other than tell people that despite how the picture look on the website this be not a medical facility mr farris I be sorry but be not the mr wall how be that different than casey in casey we require doctor to hand out state create material tell the woman about what service the state and others provide adoption center father have to pay thing now i think your distinction and you keep repeat it be these center I be assume both the license and unlicensed one be not do procedure but i do not know what an ultrasound be if not a procedure i do not know what a pregnancy test be if not a procedure i do not know how counseling on the pregnancy state be not part of medical advice in the same way a doctor give it when he be consider an abortion procedure i do not understand the difference both of them be do medical related procedure and both be be ask the chief say there be a distinction in not advertise someone else s service but in casey we permit it so please explain to me again why there be a difference here I be sorry mr klein can we go back to the question justice kennedy ask the other side which be for you to affirm or disaffirm that if one of these facility write an ad that just say pro life and put their name it appear as if the law would require them to have the statement this be not a medical facility in point font mr klein can we go back to my question i have read the law with respect to facility and it require a facility to do one of two of four thing before it qualify under the law so abortion you appear right that they have to one offer ultrasound obstetrics sonogram or prenatal care pregnancy or pregnancy testing or diagnosis or three prenatal monogram test or pregnancy and four collect health data but they have to do two or more of those thing but let us go back to the question justice kennedy ask one of these medical care facility say pro life and their name be that be they require to post a notice and you start by answer the question and i do not think you finish because they be not offer in the advertising one of these service would it be fair to say and i still do not have a full answer to my question all right pro life nothing else an unlicensed facility it meet all of the criterion have an ad that say just pro life and put its name do it have to give the notice yes or no that seem to me more burdensome and wrong because it be not tie to an advertisement that be promote medical service ,410.88,Roberts Court,"Mar 20, 2018","National Institute of Family and Life Advocates, et al.","Xavier Becerra, et al.",16-1140,"Nov 13, 2017","Jun 26, 2018",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2017,Hamer v. Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"But -- but who misled her? Was it the court or was it her own attorney? Was this malpractice on the attorney's part for asking for an extension that exceeded the Federal Rules? Assuming it's non-jurisdictional, that the statute is -- that you're right, that this is a non-jurisdictional barrier, it would still be a statutory barrier, a Federal Rules barrier. Sorry, could you slow down and tell me why not? You were served with notice of the motion, weren't you? Just so we understand the purpose of a docketing statement, I think, unless the Seventh Circuit is different than others, that its intent is for the Court to be able to identify the legal questions that will be implicated by the case, correct? And that also gives the Court the power to decide whether some sort of mediation or some sort of bifurcated briefing or whatever else is necessary, so it serves a function, doesn't it? All right.

Well, there is a problem with that because it did change the rule fundamentally when it permitted the opening of a judgment for six months, if you didn't receive notice of it. That's a fairly radical change from the norm. And so why would it be inappropriate to assume that Congress intended for a district court to exercise its discretion and judgment in deciding how much was a reasonable time for excusable neglect or for good cause?

2017,Wisconsin Central Ltd. v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Why do we have to go that far? Why go that far? Why don't we just take what the Seventh Circuit said, which is this form of compensation is money? I agree with you, a bottle of wine at Christmas is not. I don't think going to a baseball game occasionally would be, because those are not -- I don't think of who's richer or not or who's getting paid more or not by those items. But why do we have to go as far as you're going? So what do we do with history? I -- I wasn't talking about the tax regulation. I was talking about the U.S. Railroad Retirement Board, their opinion that says stock options are likely to be remuneration, money remuneration. You have the 1994 regulation by Treasury, and you have your company and many others paying this tax without saying anything until very recently. At what point do we say that history supports one reading as opposed to another? As the government points out, yes, you can't perhaps change meaning with later regulation, but later regulation can be a reflection of what everyone has understood the meaning to be. I thought -- I thought that the railroad pension system in the 1930s was at risk. That was one of the reasons why this scheme was developed. Why would you base a new scheme completely on the old scheme that was underfunded to start with? It seems counterintuitive to me that Congress would want to copy the old -- the old system, stock and barrel, when it, as you say, already knew that stock options were a part of -- of remuneration. So what's going to happen now? Every railroad is going to not pay -- if we buy your argument, not pay taxes, payroll taxes, on stock options. Why don't railroads move to giving out more stock options and less cash? And wouldn't that put the system into economic difficulty? The pensioners get less, is what you're saying to me? This self-adjusting system means that pensioners will get less. Someone pays no matter -- So who pays is the Joe Blow who gets minimum wage or something close to it, and the people who receive a lot more in stock options pay less? I don't understand that. If you get less money into the system, how are you going to pay out the same benefits? May -- may I ask: Was Mr. Dupree right about the history, that it wasn't -- from 1938 to 1994, railroads were not paying on -- cash on options? Or not paying payroll taxes on cash -- cash options? How -- what do I do with the fact that where I'm having difficulty making the leap in your argument is Congress did use ""money remuneration"" in one statute and ""wages"" defined very broadly in another. That was in 1938. Generally, when you have two different descriptions of words, you have to give them two different meanings of some sort. So what do I do with that? You're now equating money remuneration with wages as it appears in FICA, but there -- why weren't identical words used? I don't know. That doesn't help me because, if you're equating, as the current regulations do, the railroad money remuneration with FICA's wages, what do we do -- FICA requires you to value a hard-to-value stock option, and you're telling me it's not required under money remuneration. So I'm not quite sure how you can equate it when you yourself have recognized the major difference. That's easy because it's publicly traded, it's the known value. But the way the regulation is reading, it seems to be equating money remuneration completely with wages. But you're suggesting -- you're not. How many of those other code provisions use the words ""money remuneration"" as opposed to just ""money""?

2017,Pereira v. Sessions,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"What do you do with the government's position that using the word ""under"" in the notice to appear definitional section is different than what was done in other provisions -- parts of this that said ""in accordance with"" or ""required under""? So there is a difference of usage. So why should we give it this -- ""under"" the same meaning? Doesn't that in -- in and of itself create an ambiguity? If I -- if we were to disagree with you that there -- and -- and say there's ambiguity, where does that leave your argument? Do you lose? Because of Chevron and deference to the government? I think the provision requires in writing a change of date, doesn't it? Can I go back and -- and ask how this works? And I was a little confused by what happened here. They don't give you a date. Then they give you -- they mail something to you, giving you a date, or -- or -- What happened here? They didn't give him a date. They then sent a change of date to -- to the -- to the wrong address, essentially. And so he didn't get notice of the change of -- of address, and he was then deported, correct? Yeah, a final -- -- order of removal. I guess my question is, if you don't show up because you're not told when to show up, do you still have an obligation to tell them where to mail the notice to? So why are we here at all, because -- since they didn't -- I -- I -- I -- I'm just asking as a practical question. Wouldn't the -- the final order have to be vacated because he was never given proper notice of the change of address? I see. Okay. It's just the stop time that's -- Got it. I had forgotten that. Could your client go to immigration court before it's filed in immigration court? Meaning -- so the start of your client's ability to force the government to give it a hearing doesn't start until it's filed in the immigration court? And, in fact, the -- the B -- I call it the BIA; I don't know what it's called today -- -- in Ordaz, said that the notice to appear is not valid until it's actually filed with the immigration court. And so, if an order to show cause is served today but not filed, it's not valid; it doesn't stop the clock, correct, under the BIA's own reading? And a second notice to appear? All right. So, in answer, I'm assuming, to Justice Gorsuch's question is your client can make no choices until the immigration court is notified? We don't know that until it's filed with the immigration court. Because you already -- your agency has already said that in Ordaz. That a notice to appear is invalid unless it's filed with the immigration courts. Mr. Liu, help me. I -- I -- I'm simple-minded. Notice to appear seems to ask me when, where, and why. Those are the three material elements of, to my simplistic way of thinking, of the words notice to appear. When am I appearing, and for what? That -- that -- those seem the two most critical components of that word -- of those words. But not when? Mr. Liu? Mr. Liu, you're not -- Mr. Liu, is it impractical? You just said there was a system; it did have some flaws. Justice Breyer asked you, however, whether alternatives giving the date were considered. That you don't know. Designs were considered that would give the date? I do look at legislative history, and the prior language with respect to order to show cause basically said you can give those dates if practical. I look at that, and Congress knew what the BIA was doing or not doing. And then it defines this notice to appear and drops those ""as practical."" To me, that's a very telling -- that's not -- that's legislative history but not in terms of what members said but what they did. And, to me, that's often fairly convincing. Why isn't the dropping ""as practical"" -- -- inclusive of your argument? Against your argument? ",what do you do with the government s position that use the word under in the notice to appear definitional section be different than what be do in other provision part of this that say in accordance with or require under so there be a difference of usage so why should we give it this under the same meaning do not that in in and of itself create an ambiguity if i if we we be to disagree with you that there and and say there be ambiguity where do that leave your argument do you lose because of chevron and deference to the government i think the provision require in write a change of date do not it can i go back and and ask how this work and i be a little confused by what happen here they do not give you a date then they give you they mail something to you give you a date or or what happen here they do not give him a date they then send a change of date to to the to the wrong address essentially and so he do not get notice of the change of of address and he be then deport correct yeah a final order of removal i guess my question be if you do not show up because you be not tell when to show up do you still have an obligation to tell them where to mail the notice to so why be we here at all because since they do not i i i I be just ask as a practical question would not the the final order have to be vacate because he be never give proper notice of the change of address i see okay it be just the stop time that be get it i have forget that could your client go to immigration court before it be file in immigration court mean so the start of your client s ability to force the government to give it a hearing do not start until it be file in the immigration court and in fact the the b i call it the bia i do not know what it be call today in ordaz say that the notice to appear be not valid until it be actually file with the immigration court and so if an order to show because be serve today but not file it be not valid it do not stop the clock correct under the bia s own reading and a second notice to appear all right so in answer I be assume to justice gorsuch s question be your client can make no choice until the immigration court be notify we do not know that until it be file with the immigration court because you already your agency have already say that in ordaz that a notice to appear be invalid unless it be file with the immigration court mr liu help me i i I be simple mind notice to appear seem to ask me when where and why those be the three material element of to my simplistic way of thinking of the word notice to appear when be i appear and for what that that those seem the two most critical component of that word of those word but not when mr liu mr liu you be not mr liu be it impractical you just say there be a system it do have some flaw justice breyer ask you however whether alternative give the date we be consider that you do not know design we be consider that would give the date i do look at legislative history and the prior language with respect to order to show because basically say you can give those date if practical i look at that and congress know what the bia be do or not do and then it define this notice to appear and drop those as practical to me that be a very telling that be not that be legislative history but not in term of what member say but what they do and to me that be often fairly convince why be not the drop as practical inclusive of your argument against your argument ,257.58,Roberts Court,"Apr 23, 2018",Wescley Fonseca Pereira,"Jefferson B.

2017,Gill v. Whitford,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I'm not -- I'm sorry. They're -- they're estimates where you haven't put any social scientist to say that the estimate's wrong. You've poked holes, but every single social science metric points in the same direction. So there are five of them. Your map drawer is one of them, by the way, the person who actually drew these maps, and what we know is that they started out with the court plan, they created three or four different maps, they weren't partisan enough. They created three or four more maps, they weren't partisan enough. And they finally got to the final map, after maybe 10 different tries of making it more partisan, and they achieved a map that was the most partisan on the S-curve. And it worked. It worked better than they even expected. So the estimate wasn't wrong. The estimate was pretty right. So, if it's the most extreme map they could make, why isn't that enough to prove -- -- partisan asymmetry and unconstitutional gerrymandering? But they kept going back to fix the map to make it more gerrymandered. That's undisputed. The people involved in the process had traditional maps that complied with traditional criteria and then went back and threw out those maps and created more -- some that were more partisan. So why didn't they take one of the earlier maps? That's the point. Could you tell me what the value is to democracy from political gerrymandering? How -- how does that help our system of government? You -- you almost concede that it doesn't when you say if a state filed -- has a constitutional amendment or has a law that says you must comply with traditional criteria, but you must also politically gerrymander, you're saying that might be unconstitutional? I really don't understand how any of that -- what that means.

2017,Hughes v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Shumsky, could you address one issue for me on this question? In a (C) agreement, the government is giving up, often, certain things. Sometimes they dismiss additional charges. Sometimes, as here, they give up filing a persistent felony certificate. Sometimes they agree not to prosecute someone important to the defendant. There are many things that go into that bargain. How is a district court judge to determine whether a departure from the guideline range is justified? In what circumstances is what the government given up valuable enough to keep the original deal and when is it not? Except that -- let's take -- dismissing charges, I -- I think it could be seen as relatively easy. How different were the charges and the exposure from what was kept and what was the strength of the government's evidence? And the government could talk about that at sentencing on those charges. But the persistent felony offender certificate is a different judgment, which is: I, the government, think that a sentence of X amount justifies giving up that certificate. How would a district court make up for the loss of that belief by the government? Okay. When wouldn't any -- what would disqualify a defendant from eligibility? The plurality said this determination has to be made on a case-by-case basis. But as I read your brief, I can't -- what are the scenarios where you think someone would not be eligible? No, I'm saying we read the transcript. Government comes in under a (C) agreement where it says we're not recommending a guideline sentence. We want to deviate from it because we think he cooperated but not enough to be substantial. He has an ill child, whatever the reasons are, we think a lower sentence is appropriate, and this is the sentence we picked. Would that defendant, under your reading, still be eligible to go back to the district court for reconsideration? So are you conceding there's no -- you can't imagine a scenario where someone wouldn't be eligible? That's covered by Marks automatically. Meaning Marks says what's the narrowest holding of a plurality in a concurrence. And under that interpretation, the literal interpretation of Marks, your situation's covered. We're talking about a situation where the reasoning doesn't necessarily overlap completely. Why -- but -- is the confusion -- is the -- why is the confusion necessarily so evil? Meaning, the government makes a counterpoint which says you want something to -- to follow a split decision by the Court. You want some even-handed, predictable, and consistent development of the law, at least on some level. And even if there's some confusion, there is some predictability that's going on. Under the Re test, there isn't any. It's as if the decision was made and nothing has happened because we're still sending it back for the lower courts to be without real guidance. I'm sorry. Why is the development of the law stunted completely? You tell us that there's confusion in a split, which suggests to me that the split is occasioned, likely in part, by the circuit's view of the persuasiveness of the split of some other side's argument on the split. So it's not, I don't think, necessarily that it stifles discussion in any meaningful way. You're just -- you just don't -- you say this kind of confusion, I don't like. May I ask two questions? I don't want you to ignore the third question of the petition. But the first one is, if we are able to reach a majority in the Freeman question, should we reach the Marks inquiry, and, if so, how and why? I mean, we usually -- it would be pure dicta. As -- and what the prosecutors are now doing is making a waiver of any amendment of the guidelines in almost all (C) agreements. Now I have a question on the substance of the -- of the plurality's position. There is some force to the argument that -- and examples provided in the briefing -- where the government goes to sentencing and says we did this in light of the guidelines. And under the concurrence in Freeman, that would not count. Is -- is that right? And why is that right? If -- if the prosecutor is telling the judge, I'm doing this because of the guidelines, what difference does it make that it's in the plea agreement or not? It's still a representation by the government. Except the plurality says there's a player that you're not considering, which is the judge, and the judge accepts the agreement because a prosecutor has gotten up and said we think it should be within the guidelines. It's not in the plea agreement, but the prosecutor is guiding the judge and incentivizing the judge to accept this agreement with that representation. So why shouldn't that be recognized? Well, that's -- that's the way I phrased the question earlier, but really the question is not what will the parties do? The question really is what will I do? I mean, because every (C) agreement before it takes effect has to be approved by the judge. So really it's the judge who has to determine would I have accepted this or not -- -- knowing that the guideline was in error? I -- I'm not in disagreement with that. But the one thing you're -- the Solicitor General's Office said, when a judge rejects a (C) agreement, the parties are put back to their starting point, which means the government keeps its right to file the persistent felony certificate or to prosecute the dismissed charges or the charges it proposed to dismiss. In doing it this way, they don't get that chance anymore. Doing it the way the plurality suggests, they're losing that chance. Well, you're -- -- turning it into a B, instead of a C, is what you're saying. This is like all (B) agreements. ",mr shumsky could you address one issue for me on this question in a c agreement the government be give up often certain thing sometimes they dismiss additional charge sometimes as here they give up

2017,"Animal Science Products, Inc. v. Hebei Welcome Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Gottlieb, could you state -- I read some words in the opinion below that gave me pause. The court below said: ""We reaffirm the principle that when a foreign -- foreign government acting through counsel or otherwise directly participates in U.S. court proceedings by providing a sworn evidentiary proffer regarding the construction and effect of its laws and regulations, which is reasonable under the circumstances presented, a U.S. court is bound to defer to these statements."" I guess, what are you challenging or what -- can you just give me a bullet point listing of where the court erred in that statement? All right. Let's assume the following, which is closer to Pink. Okay? There is a statement by the highest court in Timbuktu, okay, not to denigrate by using that, but in another country, a sworn statement either by the Minister of Justice, who says this is a translation of the Supreme Court decision, our court is the supreme -- comparable to your court. It's the supreme court of our nation. And it addresses this issue. I think, first, you're saying the court has to determine whether the evidentiary proof is based on a statement by someone who can actually say what the law is as a final arbiter in that country, correct? All right. So the first inquiry is, is it a final statement, is it someone who's reliable. What else? Doesn't that go to the merits of the issue here? That I -- I don't know that it answers the legal question we're looking at, which is the court below didn't go through the body of evidence that Rule 44.1 permits and say there's some contradictory evidence, but it doesn't make sense in light of the minister's explanation. Isn't that what the Second Circuit should have done? What it did was look at the minister's explanation without addressing any potential conflicting evidence and saying it really doesn't conflict.

2017,Ohio v. American Express Co.,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Isn't that true, given American Express's tying or -- or restriction that no merchant can offer a consumer a 5 or 10 or other discount for using Visa, MasterCard, or Discover, correct? We have a wonderful amicus brief that explains that when you have exclusive dealing, the competition doesn't become a competition for selling that product but for selling all the competing products, correct? So that if this car dealership raises its prices too high, other car manufacturers are going to be able to give you a lower price car, perhaps of equal quality, correct? I think Justice Kennedy's question was, given the uniqueness of this market where you don't have proof of greater output, does that make the price increase irrelevant? I think that that was the nature of his question. He can correct me if I'm wrong. Mr. Stewart, could I just ask you to finish your second response to Justice Gorsuch? You said the market issue was number 1, that was fundamental. What's the second principle that you think is important? And, number 3, borrowing from Justice -- or going to Justice Breyer's point, I can -- I understand the argument why in this case on step 1 the two markets should not be joined, but I -- it's possible that in some other two-sided market that it might be a step 1. Do we have to rule and say that in no market is it? I'm sorry, what was the second general principle? I -- The court below didn't do step 2 here? You're saying do we have to accept that it's always -- looking at both sides of the market is always appropriate, or is it only in this case that it might be appropriate, and how would it be appropriate if we looked at it under step 2? Isn't that the essence of competition, to have somebody working against you? I mean, I always thought that that was the essence of competition, that someone will come in and -- and offer the people involved in the transaction something better. Better or that they may not know they want but that they may want. I -- I have to say if I go to a cash register and the merchant says to me, I'll give you a 1 percent discount today if you don't use Amex, I sit there and think to myself, do I need the airplane rewards or the train rewards, or do I want the 1 percent? And I do it -- and I choose differently each time depending on the nature of the transaction. But you -- this anti-steering removes that competition. You haven't told me why it doesn't remove competition. But I don't care about the brands. I care about my price. That's what price competition is about. I care about whether today I want to pay the 1 percent more or not. And this vertical restraint is stopping horizontal competition. I don't really care. All I know is that the merchant is offering me this at $90 or $100, and I have a choice between paying $100 or $99. At this moment, I'm paying a higher price to use American Express than I want to pay. No. Only if I'm going to use the rewards. No, because if I'm not going to use the rewards, the $99 is still more valuable to me. You're making my choice for me. You're not giving me the choice. And that's what price competition is about, my choice, not your choice about what's more valuable to me. Some people, it's hard to believe, but there are credit card users who will never use their reward points. Your system depends on that. I'm sorry, the -- the advertising mechanism failed completely. Discover tried it and said I'm just leaving money on the table because the restrictions are not just don't tell them the price difference, but don't steer them away from American Express by giving them a better deal in some other way. So you're not talking about a restriction just on what you tell them, but it's a restriction on what you do. And so that anticompetitive effect is broader than just don't talk. I mean, Discover couldn't tell them to -- or as they tried, very hard, to have the merchant agree to try to pass off the price saving to the customer. They couldn't do it under American Express's conditions. Ah, but we don't know -- But we don't know that because we don't know -- and American Express is the only one who does know. We do know that the entire price increase is not passed on to consumers. So there is a profit margin in there that can be distributed or one profit margin lowered to the benefit of the customers or -- or not, but that's what competition is about. Every competitor will decide what mix of profit, what mix will go to the consumer, won't go to the consumer, and the consumer -- finding of fact by the seven-week trial judge -- will benefit with lower prices. Well, isn't that what the rule of reason does by putting this at step 2? The government's never going to know that. It doesn't know your business model. If you want to argue procompetitive effects, you show it. It's not up to the government to show on a -- in a different market that there's a benefit that outweighs the price stifling in the main market. I mean, I've never heard of such a thing. If you think there's procompetitive effects, you prove it. I thought we had two ways of proving market power, direct and indirect. You need to show a certain control of the market in indirect, but I think case after case have said if you can control prices, you have market power. But every competitor raised their price to match American Express's merchant price. So this vertical restraint had a complete horizontal effect, so it has market power to control the merchant market. Counsel, that's step 2. But we've had two-sided markets -- -- we've had two-sided markets that we've looked at in antitrust law. Justice Breyer just mentioned one. How about the newspaper advertisers and the newspaper readers? Picayune. Oh, yes, they did, because the number of subscribers affected the price that the advertisers were going to use, and their inducement to use the -- to subsidize both morning and afternoon advertisements. This is the Leegin situation. This is a vertical restraint that controls -- that has a horizontal effect? No, not like it, but it was the exception Leegin talked about. ",be not that true give american express s tying or or restriction that no merchant can offer a consumer a or or other discount for use visa mastercard or discover correct we have a wonderful amicus brief that explain that when you have exclusive dealing the competition do not become a competition for sell that product but for sell all the compete product correct so that if this car dealership raise its price too high other car manufacturer be go to be able to give you a low price car perhaps of equal quality correct i think justice kennedy s question be give the uniqueness of this market where you do not have proof of great output do that make the price increase irrelevant i think that that be the nature of his question he can correct me if I be wrong mr stewart could i just ask you to finish your second response to justice gorsuch you say the market issue be number that be fundamental what be the second principle that you think be important and number borrow from justice or go to justice breyer s point i can i understand the argument why in this case on step the two market should not be join but i it be possible that in some other two sided market that it might be a step do we have to rule and say that in no market be it I be sorry what be the second general principle i the court below do not do step here you be say do we have to accept that it be always look at both side of the market be always appropriate or be it only in this case that it might be appropriate and how would it be appropriate if we look at it under step be not that the essence of competition to have somebody work against you i mean i always think that that be the essence of competition that someone will come in and and offer the people involve in the transaction something well well or that they may not know they want but that they may want i i have to say if i go to a cash register and the merchant say to me I will give you a percent discount today if you do not use amex i sit there and think to myself do i need the airplane reward or the train reward or do i want the percent and i do it and i choose differently each time depend on the nature of the transaction but you this anti steer remove that competition you have not tell me why it do not remove competition but i do not care about the brand i care about my price that be what price competition be about i care about whether today i want to pay the percent more or not and this vertical restraint be stop horizontal competition i do not really care all i know be that the merchant be offer me this at or and i have a choice between pay or at this moment I be pay a high price to use american express than i want to pay no only if I be go to use the reward no because if I be not go to use the reward the be still more valuable to me you be make my choice for me you be not give me the choice and that be what price competition be about my choice not your choice about what be more valuable to me some people it be hard to believe but there be credit card user who will never use their reward point your system depend on that I be sorry the the advertising mechanism fail completely discover try it and say I be just leave money on the table because the restriction be not just do not tell them the price difference but do not steer them away from american express by give them a good deal in some other way so you be not talk about a restriction just on what you tell them but it be a restriction on what you do and so that anticompetitive effect be broad than just do not talk i mean discover could not tell them to or as they try very hard to have the merchant agree to try to pass off the price save to the customer they could not do it under american express s condition ah but we do not know but we do not know that because we do not know and american express be the only one who do know we do know that the entire price increase be not pass on to consumer so there be a profit margin in there that can be distribute or one profit margin lower to the benefit of the customer or or not but that be what competition be about every competitor will decide what mix of profit what mix will go to the consumer will not go to the consumer and the consumer finding of fact by the seven week trial judge will benefit with low price well be not that what the rule of reason do by put this at step the government s never go to know that it do not know your business model if you want to argue procompetitive effect you show it it be not up to the government to show on a in a different market that there be a benefit that outweigh the price stifling in the main market i mean I have never hear of such a thing if you think there have procompetitive effect you prove it i think we have two way of prove market power direct and indirect you need to show a certain control of the market in indirect but i think case after case have say if you can control price you have market power but every competitor raise their price to match american express s merchant price so this vertical restraint have a complete horizontal effect so it have market power to control the merchant market counsel that be step but we have have two side market we have have two side market that we have look at in antitrust law justice breyer just mention one how about the newspaper advertiser and the newspaper reader picayune oh yes they do because the number of subscriber affect the price that the advertiser we be go to use and their inducement to use the to subsidize both morning and afternoon advertisement this be the leegin situation this be a vertical restraint that control that have a horizontal effect no not like it but it be the exception leegin talk about ,460.96,Roberts Court,"Feb 26, 2018","State of Ohio, et

2017,Collins v. Virginia,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"How much does your argument depend on us viewing this as two things: One, a trespass on private property, the curtilage, and then a search within that private space? Is your argument hinged on that distinction? So what difference does it make that the tarp was there? Counsel, let's change the hypothetical. Is there still a violation under your theory of law if the motorcycle was in plain view in the curtilage and he just walked on to the curtilage and what -- I don't know where the VIN is on the motorcycle, by the way. I don't -- you know, in a car, it's within the car, not outside the car, so you -- -- have to open the car door. But let's assume that you have to move something on the motorcycle. I don't know. Do you? Let's just assume that. No -- no top on it. Does your argument still stand? Counsel, we permit the police to seize items in plain view in a home. They get a search warrant for the home. They see an item that they have probable cause to believe is incriminating evidence. They can seize it. Justice Breyer said exigent circumstances permit the police to seize items. I think the assumption -- or not the assumption -- the premise of all of those cases is that the police are there legitimately. If you have a warrant, you are permitted to be there. In Jardines, you could -- couldn't seize the incriminating evidence wafting from the house because you didn't have a right to be in the curtilage. And so isn't there a difference when you are in the street, as these police officers were, they have a right to be on the street, they have a right to look at whatever is visible, and they could see the motorcycle from there? So is this a plain view case? Is this a exigent circumstance case? I -- that's why I thought that Justice Breyer was asking whether the search of the tarp was part of this because was this in plain view, in essence? As -- as I understood it, they weren't sure it was the same motorcycle. They thought the wheel was the same, but I'm not sure why they -- they needed that if they knew the motorcycle was stolen, or did they not know yet that it was stolen? I don't remember now. But how do you -- -- address the way I'm looking at this, which is -- -- the police are standing there, they see something and have probable cause to believe that it's incriminating evidence. How is that different than being inside the home with a warrant? And -- and, again, does -- I'm not sure I see the difference, although the tarp is a difference because they are lifting -- they're searching something else besides the motorcycle. Ahh, so -- -- he didn't know this was stolen property yet? The VIN number gave -- this is like Jardines. The VIN number gave him that information? But it's probable cause to arrest the driver. It's not probable cause to arrest the motorcycle. It's the driver that he was -- -- charging with elusive driving or whatever, dangerous driving. In your brief, you seem to say that you're not -- you don't seem to say -- you say you're not taking a position on whether an officer can break into a garage or walk into a garage that's closed but not locked. So you -- you seem to be suggesting that the mobility of the automobile, wherever it is, permits the police to enter. Is that -- by force or without force. Is that a yes to my question? Are you -- are -- because that seemed to be what the Virginia -- what the court below is saying, which is the -- where the item is located is irrelevant. If it's an automobile, whether in a garage or the motorcycle parked inside the living room -- some people park their bikes inside, actually -- doesn't matter where it is, that that gives the police the right to enter and search. Well, you're saying it's not necessary because the facts don't support it, but does the logic of their holding and your position require that outcome? What -- what -- how do we -- and do we basically say, contrary to our rule, that the curtilage is not part of your home? We know it is. That's what we've said in case after case. So we -- do we say now the curtilage is not part of the home for purposes of automobiles? And then how do I fit in the line? All right. Well, then that -- that goes back to my basic question, which is how do I differentiate the -- the car in the garage if -- if -- if -- or the car through a window that you can see? You would say that exigent circumstance -- that's what Virginia Court appeared to say, that it created an absolute rule. The police can break into anything, go anywhere where they see the car, whether they're at that place legitimately or not. And that's the rule you want us to uphold? It's a second. The difference between opening a garage door and just walking out and getting into a car is de minimis. You can -- you can -- you know, it happens just as quickly. So if it -- if it -- if the distinction -- and there is no real distinction -- why, as Justice Gorsuch suggested, you're asking us to expand the automobile exception dramatically and to basically make an all-time exception forever? Even if the driver -- even if the police know that the driver of this car is away on vacation and won't be returning for two weeks, even if they know that, they're not required to go to a magistrate and get a warrant? I'm sorry. I -- I -- You see the problem I have is that the court below didn't do this. It basically said -- the absolute rule, not a balancing test. It said you can search any place where a car is, because that's what the automobile exception permits. But that's a very broad statement that would permit the search of the garage or the automobile inside the house. You have a very strong argument and so would the court below if it had said: Given the nature of this driver's reckless elusion of the police previously, exigent circumstances existed in this case, all right? Or -- or something like we don't know where the owner is and he could come back immediately and get the car. But that's not the analysis the court made. It didn't reach exigency. It said only the automobile exception permits the search of any car, no matter where it is in the home. Yes, but the -- the supreme court -- -- which is the court we're reviewing -- ",how much do your argument depend on us view this as two thing one a trespass on private property the curtilage and then a search within that private space be your argument hinge on that distinction so what difference do it make that the tarp be there counsel let us change the hypothetical be there still a violation

2017,"Oil States Energy Services LLC v. Greene’s Energy Group, LLC",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I'm sorry, there is always inherent a burden of -- of -- of production. You can't write the PTO and say: I think this patent's invalid, period. You have to supply them with a reason for doing what they're doing. So, why is that reason any different than actively participating and pointing the PTO in the right direction? What is so fundamentally Article III that changes this process into an Article III violation? Both of them are just informing the PTO of the nature of its error and giving it an opportunity to correct its error. Well, not quite, because under the rules, if the third party settles with the patent owner, the PTO can still continue the action, can still decide the question, can still participate on appeal. So it is a public issue that is being litigated or discussed or adjudicated, so isn't that quite different than a normal adjudication? If this is a private right, as you claim, what does it matter in terms of whether the process is adjudicatory or not? If I own something, which is what your basic position, I understand, is, that this is a personal right, how can a government agency take that right away without due process of law at all? Isn't that the whole idea of Article III, that only a court can adjudicate that issue? Ms. Ho, I'm sorry, I thought in McCormick, that -- why did the Court even bother looking at the statute? What it did, I understood, was look at the statute and say the statute basically defines the issue of a new patent being issued as one -- before the old patent expires. And so they were really doing a statutory analysis of whether or not, by that process, the old patent was expired, and they were saying, no, if you want it to expire now, you have to go to court, because there's no statutory authority for doing it currently. So I'm not quite sure how -- how you get to the constitutional holding. It's certainly true that it didn't refer to that other statute either. So is your -- is your position that somehow at the founding in 1789, given the replete English history of the Crown and the Privy Council sidestepping -- sidestepping any judicial adjudication of validity, that in 1789 the founders intended to change that system as radically as to say, no, we're not going to permit either the legislature -- the legislature to change the terms of a patent grant? Your amici -- your strongest amici says that it had waned, the Privy Council's adjudications had waned over time and that they could only find 10 times over a 20-year period preceding 1789 in which the Privy Council had acted. But the fact that it waned didn't mean it was eliminated, and it didn't mean that the Privy Council or the Crown thought that it no longer had those rights. That -- that was what troubled me deeply about you telling Justice Kagan that, without judicial review, that this would be adequate. I mean, for me, this -- what saves this, even a patent invalidity finding, can be appealed to a court. There's deference with respect to factual matters, but there is de novo review as to legal matters. So how can you argue that the -- the Crown, the executive, the PTO, here has unfettered discretion to take away that which it's granted? Well, that's what you're saying because, without judicial review, how -- what else is it? Sorry, that only existed as of 1981, correct? So, in your judgment, could Congress permit the PTO to adjudicate infringement actions? Well, there's no historical tradition here, except the interference actions, up until 1981, of the PTO canceling issued patents. ",I be sorry there be always inherent a burden of of of production you can not write the pto and say i think this patent s invalid period you have to supply them with a reason for do what they be do so why be that reason any different than actively participate and point the pto in the right direction what be so fundamentally article iii that change this process into an article iii violation both of them be just inform the pto of the nature of its error and give it an opportunity to correct its error well not quite because under the rule if the third party settle with the patent owner the pto can still continue the action can still decide the question can still participate on appeal so it be a public issue that be be litigate or discuss or adjudicate so be not that quite different than a normal adjudication if this be a private right as you claim what do it matter in term of whether the process be adjudicatory or not if i own something which be what your basic position i understand be that this be a personal right how can a government agency take that right away without due process of law at all be not that the whole idea of article iii that only a court can adjudicate that issue ms ho I be sorry i think in mccormick that why do the court even bother look at the statute what it do i understood be look at the statute and say the statute basically define the issue of a new patent be issue as one before the old patent expire and so they we be really do a statutory analysis of whether or not by that process the old patent be expire and they we be say no if you want it to expire now you have to go to court because there be no statutory authority for do it currently so I be not quite sure how how you get to the constitutional holding it be certainly true that it do not refer to that other statute either so be your be your position that somehow at the founding in give the replete english history of the crown and the privy council sidestep sidestep any judicial adjudication of validity that in the founder intend to change that system as radically as to say no we be not go to permit either the legislature the legislature to change the term of a patent grant your amici your strong amici say that it have wan the privy council s adjudication have wan over time and that they could only find time over a year period precede in which the privy council have act but the fact that it wan do not mean it be eliminate and it do not mean that the privy council or the crown thought that it no longer have those right that that be what trouble me deeply about you tell justice kagan that without judicial review that this would be adequate i mean for me this what save this even a patent invalidity finding can be appeal to a court there be deference with respect to factual matter but there be de novo review as to legal matter so how can you argue that the the crown the executive the pto here have unfettered discretion to take away that which it be grant well that be what you be say because without judicial review how what else be it sorry that only exist as of correct so in your judgment could congress permit the pto to adjudicate infringement action well there be no historical tradition here except the interference action up until of the pto cancel issue patent ,296.12,Roberts Court,"Nov 27, 2017",Oil States Energy Services LLC,"Greene’s Energy Group, LLC",16-712,"Jun 12, 2017","Apr 24, 2018",113.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2017,China Agritech v. Resh,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I'm sorry, that's not -- the statute doesn't talk about the best represent -- best representative in terms of individual members. It says the best representative is who has the greatest financial interest. So if I'm -- if my financial interest is moderately sized or small sized, there's no inducement for me to do anything other than what American tolling tells me to do, which is to wait until the class issues are resolved before stepping forward. It does, but it says how, and that how is based on American tolling, in part, because it's suggesting who should be the lead counsel and the lead plaintiff. So your regime is now encouraging the very thing that American Pipe was trying to avoid, which is to have a multiplicity of suits being filed and encouraging every class member to come forth and file their own suit. That's what you're suggesting has to be done. Please tell me -- I'm sorry, go ahead. Is it -- I'm sorry. My question is, does the reason why the class was denied have any bearing on the rule you're proposing? I mean, I see various different potential kinds of reasons. Let's say that the plaintiff is inadequate, like happened in the second case here, that there was some collusion between plaintiff's counsel -- and I -- I'm using a loaded term, but I'm -- more as a hypothetical -- which is the plaintiff isn't representative of the class. The plaintiff has a special relationship with counsel. Any of those inadequacies of plaintiff's counsel, is that different from a deficiency in pleading in your mind? Well, all right. So are you saying that if that ruling had been that plaintiff's counsel was inadequate, the former -- the Third Circuit rule, let's call it, that that wouldn't bar a subsequent class action? So you don't see the reason for the failure of the class to have any bearing on the right of a subsequent class to be formed? I'm sorry, you're creating that rule. I think the question was, is there any other situation where we have equitably tolled someone's right to bring a suit and deprived them of a -- of a procedural right? Oh, you are, because you're -- by its terms, and we said it in Shady Grove, Rule 23 is a procedural mechanism that -- that is available to everyone who can meet its requirements. So it seems to me that what you're proposing is that we give preclusive effect, something we've said doesn't exist, to bar named plaintiffs in a second suit to whatever the findings of the court -- prior court were with respect to the class. So you're asking us to say: No, no, no, there is a preclusive effect. It stops you from invoking a class act -- your class action rights in a second suit. But I don't understand how it's not. What you're asking us is to write a new American Pipe rule. I'm sorry, you're basically saying there's a statute of limitations to bring a class action. There's no statute of limitations under American Pipe after the statute has expired for bringing an individual claim. So, assuming Justice Kennedy's hypothetical, cases lasted more than the statute of limitations, there's a thousand individual suits that were filed, could the Court then say: Those thousand I'm going to treat as a class? You're saying no. I'm sorry, this makes no sense to me. You just said the statute of limitations would stop it from being a class if it's run. But the court could do it anyway? But not as a class? Mr. Frederick, there's been a circuit split, I see it as three ways. The First, Second, Fifth, and Eleventh Circuits have basically followed your adversary's rule. The Third and Eighth say if there's a deficiency in the plaintiff, they will permit a follow-on class action but otherwise, no. And I'm assuming that that's the rule you should -- you would like here to say: In Smith, it was a timely class action. The only deficiency was in the plaintiff, not in my claim. And so you would win here. And in the Ninth and I think the Ninth and the Sixth, and somebody else has -- have followed the rule you're trying to advocate for. Go back to the Third and Eighth argument a little bit and tell me if we're thinking of doing what your adversary says, why shouldn't we accept that compromise? For you. Yeah. ",I be sorry that be not the statute do not talk about the best represent best representative in term of individual member it say the best representative be who have the great financial interest so if I be if my financial interest be moderately sized or small size there be no inducement for me to do anything other than what american tolling tell me to do which be to wait until the class issue be resolve before step forward it do but it say how and that how be base on american tolling in part because it be suggest who should be the lead counsel and the lead plaintiff so your regime be now encourage the very thing that american pipe be try to avoid which be to have a multiplicity of suit be file and encouraging every class member to come forth and file their own suit that be what you be suggest have to be do please tell me I be sorry go ahead be it I be sorry my question be do the reason why the class be deny have any bearing on the rule you be propose i mean i see various different potential kind of reason let us say that the plaintiff be inadequate like happen in the second case here that there be some collusion between plaintiff s counsel and i I be use a loaded term but I be more as a hypothetical which be the plaintiff be not representative of the class the plaintiff have a special relationship with counsel any of those inadequacy of plaintiff s counsel be that different from a deficiency in plead in your mind well all right so be you say that if that ruling have be that plaintiff s counsel be inadequate the former the third circuit rule let us call it that that would not bar a subsequent class action so you do not see the reason for the failure of the class to have any bearing on the right of a subsequent class to be form I be sorry you be create that rule i think the question be be there any other situation where we have equitably toll someone s right to bring a suit and deprive them of a of a procedural right oh you be because you be by its term and we say it in shady grove rule be a procedural mechanism that that be available to everyone who can meet its requirement so it seem to me that what you be propose be that we give preclusive effect something we have say do not exist to bar name plaintiff in a second suit to whatever the finding of the court prior court we be with respect to the class so you be ask us to say no no no there be a preclusive effect it stop you from invoke a class act your class action right in a second suit but i do not understand how it be not what you be ask us be to write a new american pipe rule I be sorry you be basically say there be a statute of limitation to bring a class action there be no statute of limitation under american pipe after the statute have expire for bring an individual claim so assume justice kennedy s hypothetical case last more than the statute of limitation there be a thousand individual suit that we be file could the court then say those thousand I be go to treat as a class you be say no I be sorry this make no sense to me you just say the statute of limitation would stop it from be a class if it be run but the court could do it anyway but not as a class mr frederick there be be a circuit split i see it as three way the first second fifth and eleventh circuit have basically follow your adversary s rule the third and eighth say if there be a deficiency in the plaintiff they will permit a follow on class action but otherwise no and I be assume that that be the rule you should you would like here to say in smith it be a timely class action the only deficiency be in the plaintiff not in my claim and so you would win here and in the ninth and i think the ninth and the sixth and somebody else have have follow the rule you be try to advocate for go back to the third and eighth argument a little bit and tell me if we be think of do what your adversary say why should not we accept that compromise for you yeah ,337.35000000000014,Roberts Court,"Mar 26, 2018","China Agritech, Inc.","Michael H.

I don't have to file. And the agent closes the investigation -- closes the file and says: I'm not going to investigate this. Under your theory, that direct obstruction would not be actionable? Well, wait a minute, yes, it can do that sometimes. It doesn't other times. So is this one of those other times? Do you think the word ""administration"" -- ""due administration of this title,"" does any work in the interpretation? It seems to me that one could say that the example I gave is an actual affirmative act by the agency. It is -- the agent is calling and doing his work under the Act but that what you do outside of interacting directly with the agency is more omission, which is not the administration of the Act. Could that line be drawn? It's not the line the government's offering -- -- but yours is -- your broadness is sweeping up a lot of conduct that I think could be perceived as active obstruction of the work of -- the direct work of the agency. An agent calls you and you mislead them. There -- there is something to be done about the context that this was drafted in. As I look at the first half of this statute -- -- ""Whoever corruptly or by force or threats of force (including any threatening letter or communication) endeavors to intimidate or impede any officer or employee of the U.S. acting in an official capacity"" -- -- ""... or in any way corruptly or by force or threat of force, (including any threatening letter or communication) obstructs or impedes, or endeavors to obstruct or impede, the due administration of this title."" All of that seems to be geared towards some affirmative act aimed at an agent or the agency. That's where I got my earlier -- -- differentiation between -- -- a affirmative act and an omission act because that doesn't have the flavor of force or threat of force or threatening, all of the sort of active, violent or active, obstructive -- -- behavior that the examples set forth. I have difficulty getting to what you have -- -- because you haven't, as Justice Kagan pointed out, given us anything in the language to anchor this in. At least -- -- Justice -- it appears Justice Gorsuch and I are trying to look at the language. A win is a win is a win. You just helped the government a lot with that statement. So how about the one example he does give? People go into shelters thinking they might be legal, might not. I'm going to role my dice. Would that be a corrupt intent? Why? I know he's not going to report, and he doesn't report. ",my problem be that i have a second question i have a lot of hypothetical under your definition of what this section mean that would not be cover so how about if an individual know that the irs be in the presence of press in the process of assess his tax and he in some way obstruct that process or an agent the agent in call the defendant and say you know I be decide whether to open an investigation i have not but I be just think about it i understand you have this business and i do not see any tax return and your client answer the way he first do i make less than i do not have to file and the agent close the investigation close the file and say I be not go to investigate this under your theory that direct obstruction would not be actionable well wait a minute yes it can do that sometimes it do not other time so be this one of those other time do you think the word administration due administration of this title do any work in the interpretation it seem to me that one could say that the example i give be an actual affirmative act by the agency it be the agent be call and do his work under the act but that what you do outside of interact directly with the agency be more omission which be not the administration of the act could that line be draw it be not the line the government s offering but yours be your broadness be sweep up a lot of conduct that i think could be perceive as active obstruction of the work of the direct work of the agency an agent call you and you mislead them there there be something to be do about the context that this be draft in as i look at the first half of this statute whoever corruptly or by force or threat of force include any threatening letter or communication endeavor to intimidate or impede any officer or employee of the us acting in an official capacity or in any way corruptly or by force or threat of force include any threatening letter or communication obstruct or impedes or endeavor to obstruct or impede the due administration of this title all of that seem to be gear towards some affirmative act aim at an agent or the agency that be where i get my early differentiation between a affirmative act and an omission act because that do not have the flavor of force or threat of force or threatening all of the sort of active violent or active obstructive behavior that the example set forth i have difficulty get to what you have because you have not as justice kagan point out give us anything in the language to anchor this in at least justice it appear justice gorsuch and i be try to look at the language a win be a win be a win you just help the government a lot with that statement so how about the one example he do give people go into shelter think they might be legal might not I be go to role my dice would that be a corrupt intent why i know he be not go to report and he do not report ,262.00000000000006,Roberts Court,"Dec 6, 2017","Carlo J.

2017,Abbott v. Perez,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"General Keller, I know you want to get to the merits, but I don't want to leave the jurisdiction question. And this last point raises it for me in stark relief, which is your -- you just said you can't draw this map. The court below said you can. By not waiting for the remedy in this case, we are not in a position to be fully informed on that question. And so I still don't understand how you distinguish Gunn, that said that in these cases, unless a district court has made clear that it is issuing an injunction or prohibiting you from using your map or some portion of your map, that you can't appeal. So could you address the -- our jurisdiction first? Well, it did at least in one of the challenges, when there were -- I think that's subject to dispute by your adversary, so let -- let's -- but the point still remains, which is every time you're ordered to change one district, it affects other districts. And in the end, the court, in drawing maps, may find that something it concluded initially is proven wrong by the map drawing. So that goes to why finality requires us to often wait for a remedy -- -- before we permit appeal. So tell me why that's not true -- why that's not the case under Gunn. No. It asked the legislator to tell it whether it intended to do redrawing. It didn't order it to do it. It just said, do you intend to? And it hadn't even started the process. But that goes only to one prong of effectively final. The other prong is, could you have gotten relief at the end of this process? You were granted a stay within less than two weeks of your filing -- filing a motion. So, even if you had gone through the remedial stage, you still would have had time to use your maps for the next election. Well, that's quite -- that's quite odd. You always had the choice of not participating and simply letting the court draw the map. You still -- well, it hasn't happened, but you could have had a -- an appeal from that. My point -- My point goes back to -- What you're now saying to us is we have an appeal after the preliminary injunction. Every time a law is declared unconstitutional -- a map is declared unconstitutional, we have an appeal. And then we have a third appeal at the end of a remedy. So automatically, because I don't see how to distinguish this from Gunn still, and I still don't know how to distinguish it from the millions of others -- not millions, I'm exaggerating greatly -- from the hundreds of these that we have received where a court has said something's unconstitutional and we have said that doesn't end the case. What ends the case is the final injunction that imposed -- that stops you from doing something and requires you to do something else. That's in 1291. I'm talking about 1253. What you're saying is automatically -- you're not giving me any way to distinguish any three-court decision on liability that doesn't result in an immediate appeal. You're basically saying every single one of them, where a court says even one district was drawn wrong, that that's immediately appealable. But that goes back to Justice Breyer's question. I don't think that ever ordering someone to come to court and give an explanation has been considered a final order. What is considered a final order is a contempt finding, something else that happens as a result of your failure to act, not the request for you to come to court. But we don't know that -- Mr. General -- General, one of the things in this recitation that you forget is that it wasn't just that court opining on these maps. It was also in August of 2012 the D.C. district court who -- who found these maps and the districts that were left untouched suspicious and who found intentional discrimination with respect to some, that found questionable some of the claims and reasons that were given by the legislature for these districts. There were serious questions raised by the D.C. circuit court. So the -- this Court basically said when it ruled: This is tentative. It's been done hurriedly. You can't rely on these findings until we have a -- a full hearing. But the D.C. district court made findings contrary to your position. So should -- wouldn't -- aren't we obligated to look at the full picture, not just the picture you want us -- the piece of the picture you want us to look at? Mr. Kneedler, what do -- what rule do we set to know how much time is enough time? Meaning, in all of these election cases, it seems to me that every single one of them, even if it's decided today, I'm going to hear that in eight months they have to do something. In three months after that, they have to do something else. In this amount of time after that, they have to do something else. Until it's clear that a district court tells a state: You can't use your map at all, even within 24 hours, this Court could intervene if need be. So I'm not sure in what other setting time constraints are a reason for immediate appeal -- -- if -- if it's not permitted generally under the law. Mr. Kneedler -- So how -- I'm sorry, I thought the -- -- I thought the legislature had its own attorney tell it that the findings of the district court were tentative, preliminary only, and that what -- and went through what the plaintiffs claim and told them that what they were doing would not address the constitutional issues that were raised by plaintiffs. So -- No, I think he said more. This won't resolve the taint that -- I believe he said it won't resolve the -- I -- I -- I -- But may I ask something? There's end of litigation. Are you ending a litigation, or are you ending the possibility of a court stopping you from discriminating? Meaning, if there is a basis, and -- and you're aware that there are claims that you intentionally discriminated, there are findings not just by the 2012 court but by the D.C. circuit court -- district court, that you have intentionally discriminated in drawing a number of lines, intentionally or in results, and you're now saying I don't really care, I want to get the court outside of messing even with my discriminatory lines. It -- I'm sorry, there's -- there's a difference between pulling out Republicans and pulling out Democrats. What shows -- in protecting an incumbent, because, presumably, our law would say you can protect an incumbent if it's race -- if it's based on party lines, but if you're using just race, what findings are there to show that this was race-based as opposed to incumbency-based? I'm sorry. Was 90 a Gingles test, or was it an intentional discrimination finding? And I don't think we need to prove that fact of -- of whether you create a -- a majority or minority; is that correct? So, I guess -- So why don't we remand -- -- then all of this just proves to me that, at best, all you get is a vacate this order and send it back under the right legal test. It's a very simple argument. You know that what you wanted to do, which was to block Hispanic voters or other voters, and -- and get certain candidates elected, that your own counsel is telling you that in those -- in certain of those districts, that's exactly what you got, and you say we want to get the district court not to change these maps, that that's enough for the three-judge panel to conclude that you wanted to put in place the discriminatory intent and effect. That's the simple argument. Well, I have -- -- I have two questions. On racial gerrymandering, I don't think we've ever required a proof of effect. We've only required that you've intentionally gerrymandered -- -- on the basis of race, is that correct? All right, but then -- but that just answer my question. On racial gerrymandering, you don't have to prove it? ",general keller i know you want to get to the merit but i do not want to leave the jurisdiction question and this last point raise it for me in stark relief which be your you just say you can not draw this map the court below say you can by not wait for the remedy in this case we be not in a position to be fully inform on that question and so i still do not understand how you distinguish gunn that say that in these case unless a district court have make clear that it be issue an injunction or prohibit you from use your map or some portion of your map that you can not appeal so could you address the our jurisdiction first well it do at least in one of the challenge when there we be i think that be subject to dispute by your adversary so let let us but the point still remain which be every time you be order to change one district it affect other district and in the end the court in draw map may find that something it conclude initially be prove wrong by the map drawing so that go to why finality require us to often wait for a remedy before we permit appeal so tell me why that be not true why that be not the case under gunn no it ask the legislator to tell it whether it intend to do redrawing it do not order it to do it it just say do you intend to and it have not even start the process but that go only to one prong of effectively final the other prong be could you have get relief at the end of this process you we be grant a stay within less than two week of your file file a motion so even if you have go through the remedial stage you still would have have time to use your map for the next election well that be quite that be quite odd you always have the choice of not participate and simply let the court draw the map you still well it have not happen but you could have have a an appeal from that my point my point go back to what you be now say to us be we have an appeal after the preliminary injunction every time a law be declare unconstitutional a map be declare unconstitutional we have an appeal and then we have a third appeal at the end of a remedy so automatically because i do not see how to distinguish this from gunn still and i still do not know how to distinguish it from the million of others not million I be exaggerate greatly from the hundred of these that we have receive where a court have say something s unconstitutional and we have say that do not end the case what end the case be the final injunction that impose that stop you from do something and require you to do something else that be in I be talk about what you be say be automatically you be not give me any way to distinguish any three court decision on liability that do not result in an immediate appeal you be basically say every single one of them where a court say even one district be draw wrong that that be immediately appealable but that go back to justice breyer s question i do not think that ever order someone to come to court and give an explanation have be consider a final order what be consider a final order be a contempt finding something else that happen as a result of your failure to act not the request for you to come to court but we do not know that mr general general one of the thing in this recitation that you forget be that it be not just that court opine on these map it be also in august of the dc district court who who find these map and the district that we be leave untouched suspicious and who find intentional discrimination with respect to some that find questionable some of the claim and reason that we be give by the legislature for these district there we be serious question raise by the dc circuit court so the this court basically say when it rule this be tentative it be be do hurriedly you can not rely on these finding until we have a a full hearing but the dc district court make finding contrary to your position so should would not be not we obligate to look at the full picture not just the picture you want us the piece of the picture you want us to look at mr kneedler what do what rule do we set to know how much time be enough time meaning in all of these election case it seem to me that every single one of them even if it be decide today I be go to hear that in eight month they have to do something in three month after that they have to do something else in this amount of time after that they have to do something else until it be clear that a district court tell a state you can not use your map at all even within hour this court could intervene if need be so I be not sure in what other set time constraint be a reason for immediate appeal if if it be not permit generally under the law mr kneedler so how I be sorry i think the i think the legislature have its own attorney tell it that the finding of the district court we be tentative preliminary only and that what and go through what the plaintiff claim and tell them that what they we be do would not address the constitutional issue that we be raise by plaintiff so no i think he say more this will not resolve the taint that i believe he say it will not resolve the i i i but may i ask something there be end of litigation be you end a litigation or be you end the possibility of a court stop you from discriminate meaning if there be a basis and and you be aware that there be claim that you intentionally discriminate there be finding not just by the court but by the dc circuit court district court that you have intentionally discriminate in draw a number of line intentionally or in result and you be now say i do not really care i want to get the court outside of mess even with my discriminatory line it I be sorry there be there be a difference between pull out republican and pull out democrat what show in protect an incumbent because presumably our law would say you can protect an incumbent if it be race if it be base on party line but if you be use just race what finding be there to show that this be race base as oppose to incumbency base I be sorry be a gingles test or be it an intentional discrimination finding and i do not think we need to prove that fact of of whether you create a a majority or minority be that correct so i guess so why do not we remand then all of this just prove to me that at best all you get be a vacate this order and send it back under the right legal test it be a very simple argument you know that what you want to do which be to block hispanic voter or other voter and and get certain candidate elect that your own counsel be tell you that in those in certain of those

2017,Dahda v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I thought the circuit split that we had granted on was whether the core concern analysis applied to subdivisions ii and iii, three. Isn't that the circuit split? Well, it wasn't the question presented, but that seemed to be the focus of the entire briefing in this case, with the exception of the government's new argument that this wasn't insufficient, but -- -- putting that aside, I thought that we granted cert on that. I'm sorry, let's go back to that point. Justice Breyer is correct. I don't find in this order saying you can intercept in Kansas. It doesn't say it directly, all right? So how is that sufficient? Is it your position that every order does not have to say it's limited to Kansas? Forgetting that it says you can go outside. 25 -- yes, and I was reading that. It's actually in subdivision (3). And it says ""may enter an ex parte order as requested or as modified,"" et cetera, ""within the territorial jurisdiction of the court in which the judge is sitting."" You take that ""within"" to mean that the judge has to be within that jurisdiction? Or that the order has to be within that jurisdiction? I -- I -- I'm sorry. Do you agree that the order has to be within the -- for interceptions within the jurisdiction? Except for a mobile device, and you agree this is not a mobile -- All right. Are you taking the position that the order does not have to say at all that it's within the jurisdiction? That's your position? All right. So you're saying only a violation of those four, of -- of subparagraph (4), even though the whole process of ordering is premised on it being an order within the jurisdiction of the Court? That's such a strange position, though, that you would have an order that wouldn't tell you where you could do this. What did it do with the requirement of every warrant that you have to give a time, place? We know the rule requires a time, a place. But there's no place here. How about if the judge fails to make the required findings under (3)? Would the order be insufficient if he didn't do what subparagraph (3) requires? Uh-huh. So that's your position. Your position is, if the jurisdiction is missing, it falls under prong 1? i, I should say, not 1, under -- This is a more interesting argument -- -- what you're -- because I can't figure out how you could have an order that doesn't have jurisdiction. It seems to me that that's a requirement of every warrant. So, if it's not correctable somewhere, it makes no sense to me. Mr. Cox (sic), just so I understand your argument, your argument really is that the core -- the court's approach was right, that the core concern analysis applies to (ii) and (iii), that what we announced in Giordano and -- and -- was it Chavez? -- that that inquiry applies to those two subdivisions. So let -- let's assume for the sake of argument, because I understand you're saying the only thing needed by the order is subparagraph (iv), that if it misses any one of these four things, we apply the core concerns analysis. So what is your -- your -- your -- your point? No, I don't want to know those terms. I want what the circuit split is. The D.C. Circuit has said -- taken a position contrary to yours in this case, but the D.C. Circuit has said that the core concerns analysis that we used for subdivision (i) doesn't apply to (ii) and (iii). Do you disagree with that? No, just answer my question. Your point is that this is not insufficient? ",i think the circuit split that we have grant on be whether the core concern analysis apply to subdivision ii and iii three be not that the circuit split well it be not the question present but that seem to be the focus of the entire briefing in this case with the exception of the government s new argument that this be not insufficient but put that aside i think that we grant cert on that I be sorry let us go back to that point justice breyer be correct i do not find in this order say you can intercept in kansa it do not say it directly all right so how be that sufficient be it your position that every order do not have to say it be limit to kansas forget that it say you can go outside yes and i be read that it be actually in subdivision and it say may enter an ex parte order as request or as modify et cetera within the territorial jurisdiction of the court in which the judge be sit you take that within to mean that the judge have to be within that jurisdiction or that the order have to be within that jurisdiction i i I be sorry do you agree that the order have to be within the for interception within the jurisdiction except for a mobile device and you agree this be not a mobile all right be you take the position that the order do not have to say at all that it be within the jurisdiction that be your position all right so you be say only a violation of those four of of subparagraph even though the whole process of order be premise on it be an order within the jurisdiction of the court that be such a strange position though that you would have an order that would not tell you where you could do this what do it do with the requirement of every warrant that you have to give a time place we know the rule require a time a place but there be no place here how about if the judge fail to make the required finding under would the order be insufficient if he do not do what subparagraph require uh huh so that be your position your position be if the jurisdiction be miss it fall under prong i i should say not under this be a more interesting argument what you be because i can not figure out how you could have an order that do not have jurisdiction it seem to me that that be a requirement of every warrant so if it be not correctable somewhere it make no sense to me mr cox sic just so i understand your argument your argument really be that the core the court s approach be right that the core concern analysis applies to ii and iii that what we announce in giordano and and be it chavez that that inquiry apply to those two subdivision so let let us assume for the sake of argument because i understand you be say the only thing need by the order be subparagraph iv that if it miss any one of these four thing we apply the core concern analysis so what be your your your your point no i do not want to know those term i want what the circuit split be the dc circuit have say take a position contrary to yours in this case but the dc circuit have say that the core concern analysis that we use for subdivision i do not apply to ii and iii do you disagree with that no just answer my question your point be that this be not insufficient ,246.76,Roberts Court,"Feb 21, 2018","Los Rovell Dahda, et al.",United States of America,17-43,"Oct 16, 2017","May 14, 2018",113.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2017,Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I'm sorry, but why -- Mr. Clement -- Mr. Clement -- But that's not true, Mr. Clement. Your -- your adversaries are taking the position, logically so, that, if a union wants to enter arbitration, we've already heard the Court speak on this issue, the union can substitute arbitration for a judicial forum because then the collective body of workers has acted together and contracted together on an equal footing with the employer for that term. Now, the problem that I have with this bilateral issue is you seem to be thinking that somehow the NLRB can't invalidate a contractual term, just as state law concepts like fraud, duress, the normal contract terms that invalidate contracts, Section 7 and Section 8 of the NLRB basically declare a contract -- a contract illegal if it does a certain thing. And that is if it stops an individual from concerted activities. So what that starts with is this contract's no longer valid. There's nothing to take to the courthouse -- Well, this issue wasn't raised there. Is this contract -- Mr. Wall, we didn't have in those cases a third -- or raised a third statutory provision that protects a particular action, in any type of action in mutual aid or concerted activity like the NLRB or the Norris-LaGuardia Act. But putting that aside, I'm not sure that the FAA is now a rule of statutory construction. Basically, what you're saying is the FAA trumps the NLRB's concerted activity statement and its broadness, that somehow it stops, you say, at the courtroom door. So does your colleague. I don't know how you do that when at least one of these agreements, if not all three, have confidentiality agreements that prohibit the employers from talking to other employers, from combining with other employers. If it does that and it stops them from going to the courtroom door, is that an unfair labor act? Only when it's been a fight between whether that statute and the cause of action it provided overrode the FAA. This is more as to the making of a contract, which is like a state law defense, a common state law defense like fraud or duress, except it's federal law here saying you can't do this. Well, it was clear in saying that concerted activity cannot be interfered with. Well, that's the point with this. What is stopping the concerted activity is not that -- which forum they choose, whether it's court or arbitration. Where you're stopping the concerted activity is in the very act of saying this can only be an individual arbitration, an individual court action. What your adversaries have stipulated to in resolving this question is, if they can have collective activity in arbitration, according to their argument, it's harder for them to win. But this particular provision is illegal because it is removing collective activity from both forums, from any forum whatsoever. That's assuming that test applies in this situation -- -- where a contract has been invalidated by statute. Why would we even need to go there? Just read the Counsel, let's assume -- Go ahead. Counselor, do you have any idea of how many union contracts provide exclusively for arbitration of disputes, individual and collective? And so is this the unusual case where the union hasn't negotiated that kind of contract? Involve non-union members. I'm sorry. Let's assume for the sake of argument that the employer here has 49 employees and he gives a contract to the employee that says you have to arbitrate with me in this forum that doesn't have class actions unless there are 50 more employees. That would be a different claim than involved here, wouldn't it? It would be the intent to interfere with collective action. But let's assume it's an Ernst & Young that has 5,000 employees, I don't actually know the number, but for sake of argument, 5,000 employees. What would be wrong by choosing an arbitral forum that limits class actions to 50 people? The federal rules say that you have to have a class that's big enough in numerosity to warrant class treatment. And, arguably -- and if there's only 20 or 25 employees, a judge could, using its -- his or her discretion, say: No, I'm not going to have a class action with 25 people. And no joint activity of any -- -- of any kind? All right. Now I understand. Yeah, that's -- Mr. Clement, how -- and these are related questions, which is how does an employee with these confidentiality agreements or even with this agreement in place -- how are they able to bring a pattern or practice or disparate treatment cause of action? And explain to me why employers would prefer an arbitration of 100 different claims, let's say in a religious accommodation case, where half the arbitrators say you must honor this -- those 50 people's religious claims and the other 50 arbitrators say no, you don't have to. Where -- how are employers and employees helped with such a system and how with these individual arbitration claims that have become more recent in -- in modern times -- this is not -- these bilateral arbitration agreements have not been the norm; they've been the norm in more recent times. When the Court said that we weren't going to recognize class actions in arbitrations, that's when employers jumped to this. But how do you deal with those two policy considerations? Well, it was bilateral commercial arbitration. ",I be sorry but why mr clement mr clement but that be not true mr clement your your adversary be take the position logically so that if a union want to enter arbitration we have already hear the court speak on this issue the union can substitute arbitration for a judicial forum because then the collective body of worker have act together and contract together on an equal footing with the employer for that term now the problem that i have with this bilateral issue be you seem to be think that somehow the nlrb can not invalidate a contractual term just as state law concept like fraud duress the normal contract term that invalidate contract section and section of the nlrb basically declare a contract a contract illegal if it do a certain thing and that be if it stop an individual

in those case a third or raise a third statutory provision that protect a particular action in any type of action in mutual aid or concerted activity like the nlrb or the norris laguardia act but put that aside I be not sure that the faa be now a rule of statutory construction basically what you be say be the faa trump the nlrb s concerted activity statement and its broadness that somehow it stop

law here say you can not do this well it be clear in say that concerted activity can not be interfere with well that be the point with this what be stop the concerted activity be not that which forum they choose whether it be court or arbitration where you be stop the concerted activity be in the very act of say this can only be an individual arbitration an individual court action what your adversary have stipulate to in resolve this question be if they can have collective activity in arbitration accord to their argument it be hard for them to win but this particular provision be illegal because it be remove collective activity from both forum from any forum whatsoever that be assume that test applies in this situation where a contract have be invalidate by statute why would we even need to go there just read the counsel let us assume go ahead counselor do you have any idea of how many union contract provide exclusively for arbitration of dispute individual and collective and so be this the unusual case where the union have not negotiate that kind of contract involve non union member I be sorry let us assume for the sake of argument that the employer here have employee and he give a contract to the employee that say you have to arbitrate with me in this forum that do not have class action unless there be more employee that would be a different claim than involve here would not it it would be the intent to interfere with collective action but let us assume it be an ernst young that have employee i do not actually know the number but for sake of argument employee what would be wrong by choose an arbitral forum that limit class action to people the federal rule say that you have to have a class that be big enough in numerosity to warrant class treatment and arguably and if there be only or employee a judge could use its his or her discretion say no I be not go to have a class action with people and no joint activity of any of any kind all right now i understand yeah that be mr clement how and these be related question which be how do an employee with these confidentiality agreement or even with this agreement in place how be they able to bring a pattern or practice or disparate treatment because of action and explain to me why employer would prefer an arbitration of different claim let us say in a religious accommodation case where half the arbitrator say you must honor this those people s religious claim and the other arbitrator say no you do not have to where how be employer and employee help with such a system and how with these individual arbitration claim that have become more recent in in modern time this be not these bilateral arbitration agreement have not be the norm they have be the norm in more recent time when the court say that we be not go to recognize class action in arbitration that be when employer jump to this but how do you deal with those two policy consideration well it be bilateral commercial arbitration

2017,Class v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"So there is a limit to your -- your definition of what this doctrine would hold. You're saying if it's not -- if the -- if the constitutional violation is not clear on the face of the admission? All right. Let -- let -- Let's -- let's go to the standard charge, which would be the crime was committed on 1991, a substantive crime and continuing conspiracy crime. Defendant pleads guilty and says, yes, I did the substantive crime in '91 and I participated in the conspiracy. And that's all he or she says. Why would not this be subject to the Blackledge line of cases, the Menna-Blackledge line of cases? Or would it be? Yes. Well, that -- that there -- a statute of limitations has run. Or there wasn't a continuing conspiracy, but how about the substantive crime, the charge is in -- is in 2017, but -- on the indictment was in 2017, but the charge, the substantive charge was 1991 with a five-year statute of limitations. Could that defendant come back and say, yes, I did that crime then? So the -- state your rule and its limitations again. One, it has to be clear on the face of the complaint. The constitutional -- I'm sorry, how can 11 -- how can the federal rules undo a constitutional rule? Blackledge and Menna were constitutional rules. So, can Rule 11(c) undo those? It's almost a vicious circle because the rules say -- -- we're not affecting that doctrine. So -- Mr. Feigin, all you're saying is how much power you have and how much power to coerce you have. The other side is simply saying if a defendant wants to accept your power, let him do so expressly. You can worry about what courts are doing separately, but that shouldn't bind him or her to the whim of whether you will let them plead guilty based on an appeal waiver that's so broad that they can't challenge anything that's a constitutional violation. And In some jurisdictions, the Judges use that to deny an acceptance of responsibility. And ""may"" -- ""may"" doesn't ""should."" And ""may"" is discretionary, because the sentencing reduction is discretionary. And I know of many prosecutors' offices who routinely tell Judges if a defendant seeks to preserve an appeal right, they have not accepted responsibility. And many Judges, just like many Judges won't accept the appeal waiver for that reason, don't give the acceptance of responsibility. All right. In -- in -- in a bunch of different cases, Bailey being one of them, the government relied in many where we found things retroactive, the government has relied on plea waivers. And most circuits have thrown out those cases by a defendant. You -- you have. I have examples of them. There are cases in which you've done that across -- maybe not you personally, but I'm talking about U.S. -- U.S. Attorneys across the country have. And courts have on the basis of plea waivers not applied retroactive law. Why? You haven't given him that. You think it's in the plea. No. The -- the nature of a plea shouldn't be to automatically say you've lost all rights because you pled guilty. That's basically what your position is today. To -- to the appeal. ",so there be a limit to your your definition of what this doctrine would hold you be say if it be not if the if the constitutional violation be not clear on the face of the admission all right let let let us let us go to the standard charge which would be the crime be commit on a substantive crime and continue conspiracy crime defendant pleads guilty and say yes i do the substantive crime in and i participate in the conspiracy and that be all he or she say why would not this be subject to the blackledge line of case the menna blackledge line of case or would it be yes well that that there a statute of limitation have run or there be not a continue conspiracy but how about the substantive crime the charge be in be in but on the indictment be in but the charge the substantive charge be with a five year statute of limitation could that defendant come back and say yes i do that crime then so the state your rule and its limitation again one it have to be clear on the face of the complaint the constitutional I be sorry how can how can the federal rule undo a constitutional rule blackledge and menna we be constitutional rule so can rule c undo those it be almost a vicious circle because the rule say we be not affect that doctrine so mr feigin all you be say be how much power you have and how much power to coerce you have the other side be simply say if a defendant want to accept your power let him do so expressly you can worry about what court be do separately but that should not bind him or her to the whim of whether you will let them plead guilty base on an appeal waiver that be so broad that they can not challenge anything that be a constitutional violation and in some jurisdiction the judge use that to deny an acceptance of responsibility and may may do not should and may be discretionary because the sentence reduction be discretionary and i know of many prosecutor office who routinely tell judge if a defendant seek to preserve an appeal right they have not accept responsibility and many judge just like many judge will not accept the appeal waiver for that reason do not give the acceptance of responsibility all right in in in a bunch of different case bailey be one of them the government rely in many where we find thing retroactive the government have rely on plea waiver and most circuit have throw out those case by a defendant you you have i have example of them there be case in which you have do that across maybe not you personally but I be talk about us us attorney across the country have and court have on the basis of plea waiver not apply retroactive law why you have not give him that you think it be in the plea no the the nature of a plea should not be to automatically say you have lose all right because you plead guilty that be basically what your position be today to to the appeal ,230.20000000000005,Roberts Court,"Oct 4, 2017",Rodney Class,United States of America,16-424,"Feb 21, 2017","Feb 21, 2018",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2017,Wilson v. Sellers,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"That might be the reasoning, correct, on merits decisions. Is it necessarily what courts do in granting or not granting a COA? A COA, which is what's at issue here, correct? What I said was it's true that on summary affirmances, where there's been full argument by both sides -- -- that you don't know the basis for a lower court's decision. But is that the uniform -- the same thing, a uniform practice in granting or denying a COA? Well, we do know in this case because we have a former chief judge of Georgia and a bunch of other -- -- judges from Georgia telling us that that's not the standard in Georgia, correct? Now, Richter does require a habeas court, a federal habeas court to imagine all of the conceivable arguments that could have supported a state court decision, correct? So it, by definition, requires more work. It's much simpler. It's much simpler? Because you're not really granting habeas relief that will result in -- necessarily in the release of a defendant because, once it goes back down, the state court can then decide which among the many possibilities there are to still affirm the conviction, couldn't it? So aren't we attributing to them -- I'm sorry, you're disavowing the statements of a former Supreme Court Justice of a Georgia court and all the judges that signed onto that amici brief? Well, then, but you don't know, do you? You don't know -- you don't, but they do because they actually did the work. I'm sorry, that's the problem, which is it does require it, because when you read 2254(d), it talks about ""resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceedings."" So it requires us to look at the reasoning. So does (a) when it talks to us about involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. So you're right. There's nothing that says you have to write an opinion in a particular way, but we do have to look at what they say. You even admit that. All right. Let's take -- and let me just deviate to that question. Let's assume that there's an argument below. The state court denies the habeas petition summarily. Can the state now come in to a habeas court and present an argument that wasn't made below and argue that that is an alternative ground to deny the habeas, even though it wasn't presented below? No -- exactly. No reasoned opinion. But we know for a fact that this particular argument was not raised below. I'm asking you what happens on hab -- on federal habeas review. Can the state come in, in this imagining that -- that we have the state doing in every court, not only do we have to imagine; the lawyers have to come in and set forth every potential constitutional violation and set forth every interpretation of the facts that are potentially available, decide which ones would be an unreasonable application of federal law or -- or unreasonable finding to grant a habeas -- you have to do the same thing to deny one. All right? Could the state come in with a totally new argument that wasn't made to the state court at all and say you should deny habeas on this totally new argument? So why do we bother having state habeas anymore? Why don't we just say don't -- have federal habeas only and -- -- and assume that the state will deny every habeas? You don't think that there's more respect for a state court, to let them make their own decisions? Because what we're doing is imagining what they would have said, instead of just asking them. There was absolutely no reasoned decision anywhere there. We had to do something. I -- I just have so much trouble. It starts with what Justice Kagan said. You admit that if the -- if it's a reasoned decision in the supreme court, we have to look at the reasoned decision, correct? All right. And there is nothing in the language of 2254(d) that says that. It just says you have to look at the reasoning and determine whether they are -- it's contrary to federal law. So I'm not sure how that gets you to where you're going. We're looking at a decision. We're looking at the one court that the state system has designated as the court that is required to take the evidence and give a full, reasoned decision. So we are looking at the full, reasoned decision and deciding whether that reasoned decision stands or not. Well, we're not saying it either. All -- all we're saying is that these reasons don't stand up to habeas scrutiny. And we would send it back for the court to properly -- and it -- because it is its decision, it shouldn't be ours -- -- to see if there is another ground for it to affirm. It's okay for you when we say you do that to find the procedural bar, because you like that. But if we're going to do it, why don't we do it in every situation, other than that you like one part of it and not the other? We've created a simple rule and states could decide what they want to do. Correct? ",that might be the reasoning correct on merit decision be it necessarily what court do in grant or not grant a coa a coa which be what be at issue here correct what i say be it be true that on summary affirmances where there be be full argument by both side that you do not know the basis for a low court s decision but be that the uniform the same thing a uniform practice in grant or deny a coa well we do know in this case because we have a former chief judge of georgia and a bunch of other judge from georgia tell us that that be not the standard in georgia correct now richter do require a habeas court a federal habeas court to imagine all of the conceivable argument that could have support a state court decision correct so it by definition require more work it be much simpler it be much simpler because you be not really grant habeas relief that will result in necessarily in the release of a defendant because once it go back down the state court can then decide which among the many possibility there be to still affirm the conviction could not it so be not we attribute to them I be sorry you be disavow the statement of a former supreme court justice of a georgia court and all the judge that sign onto that amici brief well then but you do not know do you you do not know you do not but they do because they actually do the work I be sorry that be the problem which be it do require it because when you read d it talk about result in a decision that be base on an unreasonable determination of the fact in light of the evidence present in the state court proceeding so it require us to look at the reasoning so do a when it talk to us about involve an unreasonable application of clearly establish federal law so you be right there be nothing that say you have to write an opinion in a particular way but we do have to look at what they say you even admit that all right let us take and let me just deviate to that question let us assume that there be an argument below the state court deny the habeas petition summarily can the state now come in to a habeas court and present an argument that be not make below and argue that that be an alternative ground to deny the habeas even though it be not present below no exactly no reasoned opinion but we know for a fact that this particular argument be not raise below I be ask you what happen on hab on federal habeas review can the state come in in this imagining that that we have the state do in every court not only do we have to imagine the lawyer have to come in and set forth every potential constitutional violation and set forth every interpretation of the fact that be potentially available decide which one would be an unreasonable application of federal law or or unreasonable finding to grant a habeas you have to do the same thing to deny one all right could the state come in with a totally new argument that be not make to the state court at all and say you should deny habeas on this totally new argument so why do we bother have state habeas anymore why do not we just say do not have federal habeas only and and assume that the state will deny every habeas you do not think that there be more respect for a state court to let them make their own decision because what we be do be imagine what they would have say instead of just ask them there be absolutely no reasoned decision anywhere there we have to do something i i just have so much trouble it start with what justice kagan say you admit that if the if it be a reasoned decision in the supreme court we have to look at the reasoned decision correct all right and there be nothing in the language of d that say that it just say you have to look at the reasoning and determine whether they be it be contrary to federal law so I be not sure how that get you to where you be go we be look at a decision we be look at the one court that the state system have designate as the court that be require to take the evidence and give a full reasoned decision so we be look at the full reason decision and decide whether that reason decision stand or not well we be not say it either all all we be say be that these reason do not stand up to habeas scrutiny and we would send it back for the court to properly and it because it be its decision it should not be ours to see if there be another ground for it to affirm it be okay for you when we say you do that to find the procedural bar because you like that but if we be go to do it why do not we do it in every situation other than that you like one part of it and not the other we have create a simple rule and state could decide what they want to do correct ,348.51999999999987,Roberts Court,"Oct 30, 2017",Marion Wilson,"Eric Sellers, Warden",16-6855,"Feb 27, 2017","Apr 17, 2018",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

2017,United States v. Microsoft Corporation,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"It actually requires a search. It's -- the disclosure here is really a substitute for the government searching. The Act permits the government to have a warrant and go in and search for these materials or, in the alternative, to ask the source to do its own search and then turn the materials over. So why -- you describe it as if it's only a disclosure, but it's really a search. Well, actually, it does. If you read -- if you read the provision, it's an -- an alternative for that, meaning the provision provides for a warrant that presumably would let the government do just that if it chose. Mr. Dreeben -- Mr. Dreeben, I don't know that you fairly answered Justice Ginsburg's question. This is a 1986 statute. The reality in 1986, if you look at the statute and its reference to stored records, to stored communications, was -- it's a past technology, old concept. But I think it's fair to say that back then they were thinking that where these materials were stored had a geographic existence in the United States, not abroad or nowhere else, and that they were protecting the communications that were stored in particular locations. Things have changed. But what you're asking us to do is to imagine what Congress would have done or intended in a totally different situation today. And the problem that Justice Ginsburg alludes to is the fact that, by doing so, we are trenching on the very thing that our extraterritoriality doesn't want to do, what our jurisprudence doesn't want to do, which is to create international problems. Now I understand there's a bill that's being proposed by bipartisan senators that would give you most of what you want but with great protections against foreign conflicts. There are limitations involving records that are stored abroad. Why shouldn't we leave the status quo as it is and let Congress pass a bill in this new age -- -- that addresses the potential problems that your reading would create? You mean all those amici who have written complaining about how this would conflict with so much foreign law. We've got a bunch of amici briefs telling us how much this conflicts. Let's assume because there's been a lot of back and forth, and I -- I tend to disagree, there's an open question on the Budapest Treaty, but putting that disagreement aside, assuming the point I've made, there is a bill. Can you tell me where it is in the legislative process? It's bipartisan. It's supported by the Department of State and the Department of Justice. It does deal with certain rights and limitations to the access to this information when it's stored in foreign locations. Why shouldn't we wait for that bill? There's no circuit split. We granted cert before a circuit split, which is an unusual act to start with. Mr. Rosenkranz -- I'm sorry, I don't -- perhaps it's my technological ignorance. How is it in a locked box? If I'm trying to mentally imagine this, what has to happen? You know, I press a button in the U.S. and it accesses directly the information in Ireland, or does something have to happen in Ireland?

2017,Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"So what do you make of FERC? What do you make of FERC? FERC, the government gave the state a choice. Regulate this way or don't regulate at all. And we won't either. No, there were federal standards. The states were told: Accept them or don't. But if you don't, you won't regulate, neither will we. So -- May I ask you, is this a commercial -- -- is this -- Mr. Olson, is this a commercial activity by the state? If it's licensing casinos and horse racing, isn't it involved in a commercial activity? Why isn't it when the state is licensing that? It's making money from the license. Well, I have never understood gambling not to be. You have to just watch the lines on the highways coming from all different directions and states going to gambling casinos. So if it -- if it is a commercial activity by the state, haven't we already said that the federal government can regulate that activity by the state? So why is it that telling the states that it can't license, participate in, authorize, or otherwise involve itself in gambling a strict prohibition of a commercial actor? I'm sorry. Does the injunction tell the governor that he has to enforce this law? Well -- If -- if a act is unconstitutional, those laws basically go by the wayside no matter what. But my question to you is I don't -- I read the injunction. I don't see it anywhere telling the governor he has to enforce these prohibitions. Mr. Olson, if every governor enforced every law on the book, the state would be more than bankrupt. It would have no way of surviving. There are countless laws, and even laws that are in force, that are not enforced totally. States make choices all the time. There is nothing here telling this state that it has to enforce this law. What's the difference between that and this law is unconstitutional? This law is preempted or just a simple ruling by the court, this law is preempted? Period, end of story. If -- if -- if, as I said, the court had simply said this is preempted. I have three ways of looking at this case or of the issues here. The first way is to say that this is a repeal, which it seems you're arguing, and you're saying to us does or does not this statute permit a repeal? And if I say it permits repeals of all kinds, partial or complete -- partial or not partial, we avoid the constitutional question because then you could do whatever kind of repeal you want. The second way to look at this is that the statute does not prevent repeals at all. That's what you're arguing right now. That would make this statute unconstitutional. And the third approach is basically what the government is arguing here, which is it prevents -- it permits complete repeals but not partial repeals because partial repeals of the nature taken here are actually authorizations that are prohibited by the law. So those are the three approaches. Am I missing something in what the -- those approaches are? That's the second -- -- that's the second. Or is this a fourth way of looking at it? That's my second way. That's my second way. Mr. Wall -- Can you go back to the basic question, and it was raised, I think, by the dissent, Judge Fuentes, who said you start this discussion from the fact that a law exists, if it's a partial or full repeal, the law doesn't exist. Period, end of story. And that's the baseline. So why is a partial repeal unconstitutional -- or in violation of the preemption clause? Because if the law didn't exist, the fact that they've carved out a certain section of the -- of the population for whom the law will stay in existence, that's not actually authorizing. That's just merely repealing. Well, but that's the issue that the court below avoided. I haven't looked at the licensing laws below -- in -- in New Jersey because they weren't provided to us, and it was further afield than the question presented, but the court below said that it was not -- passing on that question because it found a different answer. But you might be right if the licenses that those two facilities hold really are -- are general and say, you're authorized to do any gambling permitted by law. Then you might have an argument. But if all they do is repeal, what does it matter? I'm sorry, but the earlier version actually explicitly licensed -- it explicitly licensed and set up a complete operation requirements and other things. That -- I don't think they would have had a snowball's chance to say that that wasn't licensing or -- or effectively operating. But here, what they're saying is there were no laws -- there's a law prohibiting all gambling, we're now going to repeal part of it and say some gambling is okay. So -- Mr. Olson, I do have a question following up on what the Chief asked earlier. The Respondent says the New Jersey legislature is doing exactly what he thinks they shouldn't do or wouldn't do, which is that they are considering legislation that would fully repeal the sports betting prohibitions. I understand it's being considered by both houses. Where does that consideration stand right now? No, but you argued to us that no state legislature would do that. But here we have -- -- two have -- two bills introduced that would do just that. Why? Let -- let me ask you, what's so crazy about Congress perceiving that states would never want 12-year-olds to go into gambling houses and that the states would find some way of prohibiting that or living with rules of some sort of creating laws, regulations, conduct that would prohibit that sort of thing? That's your selective -- your selective prosecution theory, that they're permitting fantasy teams? There are four states that are -- are permitted to continue? So why don't we -- why don't we legalize -- this is a hypothetical -- marijuana because all of -- and all drugs, because there's a rampant market out there for those drugs, but we've made a policy choice that we don't want the state involved in promoting that type of enterprise. Why is this any different? ",so what do you make of ferc what do you make of ferc ferc the government give the state a choice regulate this way or do not regulate at all and we will not either no there we be federal standard the state we be tell accept them or do not but if you do not you will not regulate neither will we so may i ask you be this a commercial be this mr olson be this a commercial activity by the state if it be license casino and horse racing be not it involve in a commercial activity why be not it when the state be license that it be make money from the license well i have never understand gamble not to be you have to just watch the line on the highway come from all different direction and state go to gamble casino so if it if it be a commercial activity by the state have not we already say that the federal government can regulate that activity by the state so why be it that tell the state that it can not license participate in authorize or otherwise involve itself in gamble a strict prohibition of a commercial actor I be sorry do the injunction tell the governor that he have to enforce this law well if if a act be unconstitutional those law basically go by the wayside no matter what but my question to you be i do not i read the injunction i do not see it anywhere tell the governor he have to enforce these prohibition mr olson if every governor enforce every law on the book the state would be more than bankrupt it would have no way of survive there be countless law and even law that be in force that be not enforce totally state make choice all the time there be nothing here tell this state that it have to enforce this law what be the difference between that and this law be unconstitutional this law be preempt or just a simple ruling by the court this law be preempt period end of story if if if as i say the court have simply say this be preempt i have three way of look at this case or of the issue here the first way be to say that this be a repeal which it seem you be argue and you be say to us do or do not this statute permit a repeal and if i say it permit repeal of all kind partial or complete partial or not partial we avoid the constitutional question because then you could do whatever kind of repeal you want the second way to look at this be that the statute do not prevent repeal at all that be what you be argue right now that would make this statute unconstitutional and the third approach be basically what the government be argue here which be it prevent it permit complete repeal but not partial repeal because partial repeal of the nature take here be actually authorization that be prohibit by the law so those be the three approach be i miss something in what the those approach be that be the second that be the second or be this a fourth way of look at it that be my second way that be my second way mr wall can you go back to the basic question and it be raise i think by the dissent judge fuentes who say you start this discussion from the fact that a law exist if it be a partial or full repeal the law do not exist period end of story and that be the baseline so why be a partial repeal unconstitutional or in violation of the preemption clause because if the law do not exist the fact that they have carve out a certain section of the of the population for whom the law will stay in existence that be not actually authorize that be just merely repeal well but that be the issue that the court below avoid i have not look at the licensing law below in in new jersey because they be not provide to us and it be far afield than the question present but the court below say that it be not pass on that question because it find a different answer but you might be right if the license that those two facility hold really be be general and say you be authorize to do any gambling permit by law then you might have an argument but if all they do be repeal what do it matter I be sorry but the early version actually explicitly license it explicitly license and set up a complete operation requirement and other thing that i do not think they would have have a snowball s chance to say that that be not license or or effectively operating but here what they be say be there we be no law there be a law prohibit all gambling we be now go to repeal part of it and say some gambling be okay so mr olson i do have a question follow up on what the chief ask earlier the respondent say the new jersey legislature be do exactly what he think they should not do or would not do which be that they be consider legislation that would fully repeal the sport bet prohibition i understand it be be consider by both house where do that consideration stand right now no but you argue to us that no state legislature would do that but here we have two have two bill introduce that would do just that why let let me ask you what be so crazy about congress perceive that state would never want year old to go into gamble house and that the state would find some way of prohibit that or live with rule of some sort of create law regulation conduct that would prohibit that sort of thing that be your selective your selective prosecution theory that they be permit fantasy team there be four state that be be permit to continue so why do not we why do not we legalize this be a hypothetical marijuana because all of and all drug because there be a rampant market out there for those drug but we have make a policy choice that we do not want the state involve in promote that type of enterprise why be this any different ,417.49,Roberts Court,"Dec 4, 2017","Philip D.

2017,"Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Can I ask you -- I'm sorry, he did refuse to sell -- I'm sorry, didn't he refuse to sell cupcakes that he sells regularly to the public to some same-sex couples who intended to marry? But I thought -- I'm a little bit surprised by what you're saying because your brief seemed to suggest differently -- that the couple was looking at his already pre-designed cakes that he appears to sell without any customization, and they sat down with him, and he said I don't supply cakes of any kind to gay couples. So I thought this cake was about his refusal to supply a cake for any wedding ceremony. Could you tell me how far -- So that begs the question, when have we ever given protection to a food? The primary purpose of a food of any kind is to be eaten. Now, some people might love the aesthetic appeal of a special dessert, and look at it for a very long time, but in the end its only purpose is to be eaten. And the same with many of the things that you've mentioned. A hairdo is to show off the person, not the artist. When people at a wedding look at a wedding cake and they see words, as one of the amici here, the pastry chef said, there was a gentleman who had upset his wife and written some words that said ""I'm sorry for what I did,"" something comparable, and the chef was asked -- the cake maker was asked, was that affiliated with you? And she said no. It's affiliated with the person who shows the cake at their wedding. It's what they wish to show. So how is this your client's expression, and how can we find something whose predominant purpose is virtually always to be eaten? Call it a medium for expressive expression. Mind you, I can see if they've -- create a cake and put it in a museum as an example of some work of art, that might be different because the circumstances would show that they want this to be affiliated with themselves. But explain how that becomes expressive speech, that medium becomes expressive speech. You know, the other night I had some people over and one of them brought a box of cupcakes and one of the cupcakes was smashed against the box. That was the only cupcake not eaten. Now, I suspect that one of the reasons is the others were so much more attractive whole. There is creation in serving food, in creating any type of edible product. People -- there are sandwich artists now. There are people who create beauty in what they make, but we still don't call it expressive and entitled to First Amendment protection. All right. Would you stop -- would that belief that expresses speech trump public accommodation laws against discrimination or protecting customers from race? Yes or no. Oh, it didn't in Newman versus Piggie? There was a -- he claimed that he was religious, that he opposed serving blacks because it mixed the races, and we basically refused both his free expression and his free exercise clauses. So are you saying that your rule now would trump protection against race discrimination? I'll read Newman myself. Answer my question. It's your theory -- is your theory that you -- that you -- public accommodation laws cannot trump free speech or free-exercise claims in protecting against race discrimination? So how about disability; I'm not going to serve cakes to two disabled people because God makes perfect creations, and there are some religions who believe that? So how about there? Well, your client was saying that providing a cake to a same-sex couple was against his free-expression rights because -- and his free-exercise rights, because he cannot celebrate that kind of marriage. Counsel, sometimes it's not just dignity. A couple of the briefs -- one of the amici briefs pointed out that most military bases are in isolated areas far from cities and that they're in areas where the general population, service population, is of one religion or close to one religious belief. So where there might be two cake bakers. They name a couple of military bases like that. Or two florists or one photographer. Very small number of resources. And in those situations, they posit, and I don't think probably wrongly, that it may come to pass where the two cake bakers will claim the same abstention here. So how do we protect the military men and women who are of the same sex who want to get married in that town because that's where all their friends are, because the base is there? All right? How do we protect those people? So -- but isn't that -- isn't that the same for everybody? Meaning, look, we live in a society with competing beliefs, and all of our cases have always said where LGBT people have been -- you know, they've been humiliated, disrespected, treated uncivilly. The briefs are filled with situations that -- -- the gay couple who was left on the side of the highway on a rainy night, people who have been denied medical treatment or whose children have been denied medical treatment because the doctor didn't believe in same-sex parenthood, et cetera. We've always said in our public accommodations law we can't change your private beliefs, we can't compel you to like these people, we can't compel you to bring them into your home, but if you want to be a part of our community, of our civic community, there's certain behavior, conduct -- -- you can't engage in. And that includes not selling products that you sell to everyone else to people simply because of their either race, religion, national origin, gender, and in this case sexual orientation. So we can't legislate civility and rudeness, but we can and have permitted it as a compelling state interest legislating behavior. So why is not selling or selling to one group as opposed to another not behavior? That was a private parade. I'm not going to -- I -- I -- I was a little confused -- How many commissioners are there? How many commissioners are there? I'd like you to answer Justice Kennedy's question. How many commissioners are there? All right. If one -- if there was a belief, not yours -- stop fighting the belief; accept the hypothetical -- that this person was improperly biased, what happens then? I think that's what Justice Kennedy is asking you. One of the commissioners is improperly biased. Counselor, in that case -- Could you answer -- Would you answer that question? I'm sorry, could you answer the question asked? Let's assume this couple did come in and wanted the rainbow cake. And this gentleman says one of two things: If you're same-sex, I'm not going to provide you with a rainbow cake or I don't create rainbow cakes for weddings because I don't believe in same-sex marriage. I'm not going to sell it to you. I'm not going to sell it to a same -- a heterosexual couple. I just don't want to be affiliated with that concept of rainbowness at a wedding, any kind of wedding. So what are the difference in treatment? How do you deal under your hypothetical with hotels associated with weddings? You know, hotels -- -- rent out banquet halls, their staff. Would they be entitled to the exception you're imagining? Why? You're not advocating this? Ms. Waggoner, here the seller of the cakes is not Mr. Phillips, it's Masterpiece Corporation. Does it -- in your arguments, who controls the expression here, the corporation or its shareholders? I always thought corporations were separate entities. And how do we impute to this corporation, which is just a bakery, it doesn't purport to sell just religious items, it's a public place, how do we -- and how do we make this decision with respect to the rights of individuals in a corporation that don't have objections? So can the chef at the Hilton -- and I don't mean to demean the Hilton or anybody else, I'm using it as an example -- can he say I don't believe in same-sex marriage and I won't create a cake and can he be fired? But who makes a decision for the corporation? In -- in most situations -- it may be easier in a closely-held corporation, it may be the shareholders. I don't know if it's the corporate board or it's the shareholders. Who -- who decides? It can't be the employee -- -- speaking for the corporation. The employee can be made an agent of the corporation and speak on its behalf, but the employee can't choose it on behalf of the corporation. It's him and his wife, right? Counsel, the problem is that America's reaction to mixed marriages and to race didn't change on its own. It changed because we had public accommodation laws that forced people to do things that many claimed were against their expressive rights and against their religious rights. It's not denigrating someone by saying, as I mentioned earlier, to say: If you choose to participate in our community in a public way, your choice, you can choose to sell cakes or not. You can choose to sell cupcakes or not, whatever it is you choose to sell, you have to sell it to everyone who knocks on your door, if you open your door to everyone. Then don't participate in weddings, or create a cake that is neutral, but you don't have to take and offer goods to the public and then choose not to sell to some because of a protected characteristic. That's what the public anti-discrimination laws require. ",can i ask you I be sorry he do refuse to sell I be sorry do not he refuse to sell cupcake that he sell regularly to the public to some same sex couple who intend to marry but i think I be a little bit surprise by what you be say because your brief seem to suggest differently that the couple be look at his already pre design cake that he appear to sell without any customization and they sit down

oppose serve black because it mix the race and we basically refuse both his free expression and his free exercise clause so be you say that your rule now would trump protection against race discrimination I will read newman myself answer my question it be your theory be your theory that you that you public accommodation law can not trump free speech or free exercise claim in protect against race discrimination so how about disability I be not go to serve cake to two disabled people because god make perfect creation and there be some religion who believe that so how about there well your client be say that provide a cake to a same sex couple be against his free expression right because and his free exercise right because he can not celebrate that kind of marriage counsel

2017,"Cyan, Inc. v. Beaver County Employees' Retirement Fund",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I'm sorry, I thought the whole purpose, the main purpose, of SLUSA was just that, to ensure that claims of this particular type were not covered under state law but covered under federal law. If I accept that that was the main purpose of Congress's position, what difference does it make who adjudicates the claim if both courts are going to be bound by federal law? Doesn't your -- doesn't your reading contain an inherent contradiction? If the first clause is supposed to preclude or give exclusive jurisdiction to the district courts over all covered class actions, which under your reading includes even those that are not federal -- -- why then have the second ""except""? Isn't there a tension between the two? Well, you're -- there's an inherent tension in the two ""except"" clauses otherwise. You're giving -- you're saying the second ""except"" helps you, but -- -- they're contradictory on that. I -- I'm sorry. Your -- your -- your reading of that first ""except"" clause -- -- is that it covers all covered class actions as defined in p(f)(2). P(f)(2) defines covered class actions only as those that have 50 or -- -- 50 or more people, a certain amount of damages. That could include federal or state law claims. Under your reading, this reference to ""except"" is definitional, p(f)(2). I'm sorry, that says nothing about ousting the state courts. It says providing national standards that will control state enforcement agencies. So whether it's state court or federal court, it's still the same national standards. But -- but -- but going -- What was very clear in the Act is that there are certain sections that were clearly intended to be national, certain things that were and were not covered, and then there were, you're right, some procedural aspects, but nowhere in those procedural aspects did Congress say they have to be followed both in state and federal court. Can we -- can we go back to your definition? A covered class action under, I call it 77p, it's just easier for me, has a bunch of different subsections. You're relying on the definitional one. But each of the pertinent ones also talks about class action limitations, removal of covered class actions by referencing ""p"" in its entirety. What is either illogical, contextually wrong, or improper about looking at all of the provisions of ""p"" that talk with respect to covered class actions? Because b and c are certainly talking with respect to covered class actions. No, he's not doing that. He's saying you look at every provision that mentions or talks about the covered class action. Assuming -- All right. So why not -- why not make the second ""except"" clause read identically? But the Congress didn't. Under your theory, assume somebody brings a 1933 Act claim, in state court, tied to a non-1933 state law action. Under your theory, what happens to that case? It can't get removed because under (c) you can only remove those claims that are -- state law claims that are based on 1933. And this says you can't remove them. So now what happens? So your theory is that on those claims they just get ousted out of court, even though they have a non-covered, completely viable non-'33 state law action? That's -- that's a fairly extreme result on a reading that bucks the presumption, and one that exists when there's an ambiguity, that says we presume in favor of concurrent jurisdiction. So you're taking a very strong presumption, turning it on its head, and saying we're ousting state courts over jurisdiction of securities actions that have nothing to do with federal law. That's -- that's what you're saying. Why is it not exactly right? No, this Act does not preempt those state law non-1933, non-federal actions. For those state law claims that relate to federal claims -- that relate to federal claims. But it explicitly exempts out those that don't. Exactly. State claims. Exactly. So how about -- -- anti-commandeering cases? In what other situation where we do not have a federal law that preempts a state law have we ever permitted the federal government to tell the states that they can't adjudicate a case under their own law? I -- I -- -- I think it's a very natural argument. Under what -- But it's not -- you just said to me the '33 and the '34 Act do not preclude certain state law securities actions. If they're not precluded, how can we give a reading to this provision that would stop the state courts from adjudicating those cases? No -- -- you can -- you can pass a federal law that says this federal law precludes these actions. But if you don't have one that says that -- -- how can you order the state court not to adjudicate a claim that is not precluded -- -- that is expressly not precluded. Counsel, what do you do with our statement in Kircher? And I know you try to distinguish it. But it very explicitly says removal and jurisdiction to deal with removed cases is limited to those precluded in the terms of subsection (b). And that was the very argument that was raised there. Counsel, that's a bit of a stretch. When I read the -- -- opinion, every time it related to, itself to (1) or (2), it would say something like, like (1) and (2), or (1) and others. It would not limit itself to just (1) and (2). It would just -- The removal. I have one. What do you think -- what would be the null set if you read the government's reading of the removal -- the involving -- if you read it -- Its reading today. I assume you understand it. All right. If we read it the government's way -- -- what would we make -- what would be left of the second ""except"" clause in -- in 77v(a)? Yes. Second ""except"" clause. Right. If you read this the way the government does -- -- it says you can't remove these cases in (a) -- -- right, so you can't remove them, but (c) says you can remove them. So is there anything then that is not removable? Why write the second ""except"" clause at all? I'm sorry -- -- what provision are you citing? ",I be sorry i think the whole purpose the main purpose of slusa be just that to ensure that claim of this particular type we be not cover under state law but cover under federal law if i accept that that be the main purpose of congress s position what difference do it make who adjudicate the claim if both court be go to be bind by federal law do not your do not your reading contain an inherent contradiction if the first clause be suppose to preclude or give exclusive jurisdiction to the district court over all covered class action which under your reading include even those that be not federal why then have the second except be not there a tension between the two well you be there be an inherent tension in the two except clause otherwise you be give you be say the second except help you but they be contradictory on that i I be sorry your your your reading of that first except clause be that it cover all covered class action as define in p f p f defines cover class action only as those that have or or more people a certain amount of damage that could include federal or state law claim under your reading this reference to except be definitional p f I be sorry that say nothing about oust the state court it say provide national standard that will control state enforcement agency so whether it be state court or federal court it be still the same national standard but but but go what be very clear in the act be that there be certain section that we be clearly intend to be national certain thing that we be and we be not cover and then there we be you be right some procedural aspect but nowhere in those procedural aspect do congress say they have to be follow both in state and federal court can we can we go back to your definition a covered class action under i call it p it be just easy for me have a bunch of different subsection you be rely on the definitional one but each of the pertinent one also talk about class action limitation removal of covered class

certainly talk with respect to covered class action no he be not do that he be say you look at every provision that mention or talk about the covered class action assume all right so why not why not make the second except clause read identically but the congress do not under your theory assume somebody bring a act claim in state court tie to a non state law action under your theory what happen to that case it can not get remove because under c you can only remove those claim that be state law claim that be base on and this say you can not remove them so now what happen so your theory be that on those claim they just get oust out of court even though they have a non cover completely viable non state law action that be that be a fairly extreme result on a reading that buck the presumption

for those state law claim that relate to federal claim that relate to federal claim but it explicitly exempt out those that do not exactly state claim exactly so how about anti commandeer case in what other situation where we do not have a federal law that preempt a state law have we ever permit the federal government to tell the state that they can not adjudicate a case under their own law i i i think it be a very natural argument under what but it be not you just say to me the and the act do not preclude certain state law security action if they be not preclude how can we give a reading to this provision that would stop the state court from adjudicate those case no you can you can pass a federal law that say this federal law precludes these action but if you do not have one that say that how can you order the state court not to adjudicate a claim that be not precluded that be expressly not preclude counsel what do you do with our statement in kircher and i know you try to distinguish it but it very explicitly say removal and jurisdiction to deal with removed case be limited to those preclude in the term of subsection b and that be the very argument that be raise there counsel that be a bit of a stretch when i read the opinion every time it relate to itself to or it would say something like like and or and others it would not limit itself to just and it would just the removal i have one what do you think what would be the null set if you read the government s reading of the removal the involve if you read it its reading today i assume you understand it all right if we read it the government s way what would we make what would be leave of the second except clause in in v a yes second except clause right if you read this the way the government do it say you can not remove these case in a right so you can not remove them but c say you can remove them so be there anything then that be not removable why write the second except clause at all I be sorry

2017,Sessions v. Dimaya,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I thought the Johnson, two features at issue were the fact that we were asking courts to imagine what the ordinary crime was, and there was no way to even think about what that was. Your adversary points out, with burglary, if the ordinary crime is during the day, there's one level of risk. If it's at night, there's a different level of risk. The nature of the entry is at question, whether it's forcible or merely walking through an open door uninvited. It may be easier with burglary for lots of reasons, but there -- the level of what -- or what constitutes an ordinary crime was somewhat at the center of Johnson. Why isn't it at the center here? I remember the government arguing in Johnson that most people who are found with sawed-off shotguns are committing crimes. Why isn't that a substantial risk of force being used? If statistically -- if statistically -- and I don't remember the statistics now, but they were very clear then that a huge amount -- number of the crimes of possession of a shotgun were -- led to criminal activity. Well, the use of force is not necessary for the use of -- for burglary if you walk in and there's nobody there. You take what you find. So we're now going back to gut instinct. That observation was at a time before the draconian effects of removal and deportation came into effect. We now have lifetime bars, which were rarely or on very limited circumstances imposed previously. We have many more criminal sanctions with harsher sentences now. I think more than anything we have often said that vagueness depends on the gravity of what is at stake. Today what's at stake is a lot more than what was at stake decades ago. And there is always the fail safe that the Attorney General in his or her discretion can deny -- can deny anyone the right to stay here. But if we're going to ask immigration judges to impose the consequences that they do today, don't we need something that's not arbitrary? That's if you concentrate on us, but I did read those portions of Respondent's brief and the amici brief, and it does seem like we are going to have a redux Sykes and a redux James and a redux many of the issues. There were some -- There were some who argued in the drunken driving test that the minute you get behind the car, you -- drunk, you're using a lethal weapon, a car, to inflict injury on others. Didn't win here, but that argument was still being made in the courts below and some courts below bought it. ",i think the johnson two feature at issue we be the fact that we we be ask court to imagine what the ordinary crime be and there be no way to even think about what that be your adversary point out with burglary if the ordinary crime be during the day there be one level of risk if it be at night there be a different level of risk the nature of the entry be at question whether it be forcible or merely walk through an open door uninvited it may be easy with burglary for lot of reason but there the level of what or what constitute an ordinary crime be somewhat at the center of johnson why be not it at the center here i remember the government argue in johnson that most people who be find with saw off shotgun be commit crime why be not that a substantial risk of force be use if statistically if statistically and i do not remember the statistic now but they we be very clear then that a huge amount number of the crime of possession of a shotgun we be lead to criminal activity well the use of force be not necessary for the use of for burglary if you walk in and there be nobody there you take what you find so we be now go back to gut instinct that observation be at a time before the draconian effect of removal and deportation come into effect we now have lifetime bar which we be rarely or on very limited circumstance impose previously we have many more criminal sanction with harsh sentence now i think more than anything we have often say that vagueness depend on the gravity of what be at stake today what be at stake be a lot more than what be at stake decade ago and there be always the fail safe that the attorney general in his or her discretion can deny can deny anyone the right to stay here but if we be go to ask immigration judge to impose the consequence that they do today do not we need something that be not arbitrary that be if you concentrate on us but i do read those portion of respondent s brief and the amici brief and it do seem like we be go to have a redux sykes and a redux james and a redux many of the issue there we be some there we be some who argue in the drunken driving test that the minute you get behind the car you drink you be use a lethal weapon a car to inflict injury on others do not win here but that argument be still be make in the court below and some court below buy it ,187.45,Roberts Court,"Jan 17, 2017","Jefferson B.

2017,Byrd v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Could I ask why we're here on -- How will the government know that? How will the police know that? The police come up to a rental car. They ask for your license and your registration. You give them your license and a rental agreement that doesn't list you. How are they supposed to know the owner gave you permission? Mr. Rakas -- -- our decision in -- I'm sorry, counselor -- our decision in Rakas was premised on a number of things, most importantly that the defendant didn't claim any possession or privacy interest in the goods searched or in the things in the glove compartment, et cetera. Why -- what's happened here? Meaning, is your client -- how did the information that he was given permission to store things in the trunk come before the Court? So I'm having -- I'm having a problem with this case, which is why are we here? Meaning, once he admitted that the -- that the goods in the trunk were his, I don't know why that doesn't give him automatic standing to challenge the search. I thought in Rakas it was the fact that the defendants had repeated three or four or five different times that the defendants claimed no proprietary interest in the goods searched. That's different than this case, isn't it? So why are we here on this legal issue at all? Even if you don't have an expectation of privacy in the trunk, you've claimed an expectation of privacy in the property. And absent probable cause, there's no right to search. So why are we here? But I'm not -- she's absolutely right, counselor, but I'm asking why are you pitching this case on the automobile exception. Why don't you just argue the straightforward point that the whole -- this whole discussion is about who has the right to challenge a search, and without probable cause. All right? If you're claiming an interest in the property at issue, he's claimed it, he testified, he has a right. So now we go to a suppression hearing. Let's assume he wasn't a criminal. Let's assume it was the renter's son, not the wife because there is an exception for spouse in the contract. Is that son in the same position as Mr. Reed? I -- I don't disagree with you, but I'm asking a question, which is: Police can search a car when they have probable cause, correct? And they're free to do that of any car driven even by a licensed driver, correct? Or a licensed co-driver on a rental agreement. So really the issue here before us is when are the police permitted to search without a warrant, without probable cause? And that's what I see the issue as, because if we rule that someone without permission can -- has no expectation of privacy even when the renter has given it to them, then what we're authorizing is the police to stop every rental car and search every rental car, without probable cause, that might be on the road. Well, the police here said we stopped him because he was driving a rental car. He was doing something totally illegal. Every driving school teaches you to put your hands at a 10 to 2 angle, and they found that suspicious. (Laughter.) And they waited until he made a turn that was not authorized by the traffic laws. So to say that there isn't a practice is a little bit disingenuous, Mr. Feigin. But the question I really have is should we be creating exceptions to the most basic of Fourth Amendment rights, that of probable cause, before police intrude in searching at all? And we're doing it under the guise, not of was this search legal under the Fourth Amendment, but whether someone has standing to even question that. Because this is a standing case, correct? Their own effect. Well, we know that he was told that he could use the trunk and put things in it, whether he's a passenger or a driver. Once he says that and the owner of -- and the renter of the car agrees with him, I'm still not sure what's missing. Why that claim of an interest is inadequate. So every criminal defendant where their suitcase has been searched would have to say, I'm more than just the owner of the suitcase? I'm the owner of the drugs? Let's assume he came in and said, I was the owner of the suitcase. I thought he made claims to the -- to the trunk, that he said I was given permission to store my things in the trunk, and that's what I did. But where have -- where else -- We have never incorporated private rights into the Fourth Amendment. We've said that we either look to property or tort law to define private rights. If the issue was what the owner versus a authorized user's rights are, we don't do that. We don't look in searches of homes to what the owner of the apartment would say. I would suspect that every owner of the apartment would say: My tenants don't have a right to engage in illegal activity. And there may well be contracts that say, my tenants, you can't do illegal activity here. But we have recognized the rights of tenants to privacy in their home -- -- because they possess it. Oh, no. But we've recognized overnight guests, we've recognized co-inhabitants that are not licensed in the lease. There are 55-and-older communities in certain parts of the country where children under the age of 55 and grandchildren routinely stay. And I doubt very much that we would ever say they don't have that legitimate expectation. So the question that I go is this will be our very, very first time where we're saying a private contract that doesn't speak about criminal liability but speaks only about insurance consequences with respect to unauthorized drivers is creating a Fourth Amendment protection. For the police, rather than for the person involved. But they -- they also say that -- Oh, yes, we do -- How about when they -- -- came and got the -- became an authorized driver by lying, I don't have a criminal conviction, and he's listed, what happens then? Is that a violation of the contract sufficient enough to invalidate his expectation of privacy? So we've now -- -- criminalized a contract -- -- and a contract breach. I know you don't, but I -- I -- (Laughter.) So, Mr. Feigin, the rule you want us to write in this opinion is, if you are an unauthorized driver of a rental car, even if you have permission of the authorized driver, the police can search the trunk without any probable cause? Yeah, but the bottom line is the one I announced. Does the son of a father who owns the car but is not an authorized driver on insurance and, as a result, is not listed on the registration or the insurance card, does that son -- now we're out of the renter situation, we're in the ownership situation -- does that son have an expectation of privacy? But why? He's breaking the law. He doesn't have the child listed on the insurance. He hasn't listed the child on the registration. Why is this different than the renter situation? ",could i ask why we be here on how will the government know that how will the police know that the police come up to a rental car they ask for your license and your registration you give them your license and a rental agreement that do not list you how be they suppose to know the owner give you permission mr rakas our decision in I be sorry counselor our decision in rakas be premise on a number of thing most importantly that the defendant do not claim any possession or privacy interest in the good search or in the thing in the glove compartment et cetera why what be happen here meaning be your client how do the information that he be give permission to store thing in the trunk come before the court so I be have I be have a problem with this case which be why be we here meaning once he admit that the that the good in the trunk we be his i do not know why that do not give him automatic standing to challenge the search i think in rakas it be the fact that the defendant have repeat three or four or five different time that the defendant claim no proprietary interest in the good search that be different than this case be not it so why be we here on this legal issue at all even if you do not have an expectation of privacy in the trunk you have claim an expectation of privacy in the property and absent probable because there be no right to search so why be we here but I be not she be absolutely right counselor but I be ask why be you pitch this case on the automobile exception why do not you just argue the straightforward point that the whole this whole discussion be about who have the right to challenge a search and without probable because all right if you be claim an interest in the property at issue he be claim it he testify he have a right so now we go to a suppression hearing let us assume he be not a criminal let us assume it be the renter s son not the wife because there be an exception for spouse in the contract be that son in the same position as mr reed i i do not disagree with you but I be ask a question which be police can search a car when they have probable because correct and they be free to do that of any car drive even by a licensed driver correct or a licensed co driver on a rental agreement so really the issue here before us be when be the police permit to search without a warrant without probable because and that be what i see the issue as because if we rule that someone without permission can have no expectation of privacy even when the renter have give it to them then what we be authorize be the police to stop every rental car and search every rental car without probable because that might be on the road well the police here say we stop him because he be drive a rental car he be do something totally illegal every drive school teach you to put your hand at a to angle and they find that suspicious laughter and they wait until he make a turn that be not authorize by the traffic law so to say that there be not a practice be a little bit disingenuous mr feigin but the question i really have be should we be create exception to the most basic of fourth amendment right that of probable because before police intrude in search at all and we be do it under the guise not of be this search legal under the fourth amendment but whether someone have stand to even question that because this be a stand case correct their own effect well we know that he be tell that he could use the trunk and put thing in it whether he be a passenger or a driver once he say that and the owner of and the renter of the car agree with him I be still not sure what be miss why that claim of an interest be inadequate so every criminal defendant where their suitcase have be search would have to say I be more than just the owner of the suitcase I be the owner of the drug let us assume he come in and say i be the owner of the suitcase i think he make claim to the to the trunk that he say i be give permission to store my thing in the trunk and that be what i do but where have where else we have never incorporate private right into the fourth amendment we have say that we either look to property or tort law to define private right if the issue be what the owner versus a authorized user s right be we do not do that we do not look in search of home to what the owner of the apartment would say i would suspect that every owner of the apartment would say my tenant do not have a right to engage in illegal activity and there may well be contract that say my tenant you can not do illegal activity here but we have recognize the right of tenant to privacy in their home because they possess it oh no but we have recognize overnight guest we have recognize co inhabitant that be not license in the lease there be and old community in certain part of the country where child under the age of and grandchild routinely stay and i doubt very much that we would ever say they do not have that legitimate expectation so the

authorize driver by lie i do not have a criminal conviction and he be list what happen then be that a violation of the contract sufficient enough to invalidate his expectation of privacy so we have now criminalize a contract and a contract breach i know you do not but i i laughter so mr feigin the rule you want us to write in this opinion be if you be an unauthorized driver of a rental car even if you have permission of the authorized driver the police can search the trunk without any probable because yeah but the bottom line be the one i announce do the son of a father who own the car but

2017,Chavez-Meza v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I'm sorry, I just don't understand what ""minimal"" means. If you're answering Justice Alito the way you did, which is I can't imagine needing anything more than a judge saying I'm going to grant a reduction, but given the seriousness of this crime and how -- what you did, I think whatever number he picks, why that would become unreasonable or subject to more explanation. But you said to Justice Alito no. I'm asking -- that -- that's shocking to me, to be frank with you, because that answer would mean that the judge not only has to say that the crime was serious, what you did was serious, but I think 108 is not enough because it's the bottom of the guideline range; I don't think the guideline range should control. I mean, what more of an explanation does a judge have to do than to say it was a serious crime, 114 is the right amount? I'm afraid that -- you keep answering -- you're creating a rule that makes it impossible for district court judges to do anything but what you want. Well, but that's where it's coming. Let's -- let's start at here. We know the district court at the original sentence said, I'm troubled by this crime and the degree of your participation in it. It's a serious crime. You were a very active participant in it. He still gave him essentially the low end of the guideline. But why is it unreasonable for us to infer that in the resentencing he picked 114 because he remained concerned about the seriousness of this crime and your defendant's participation in it? Since the guidelines are advisory, what would make it improper for the judge to say, I don't care what the guidelines say, I think trafficking of this type is serious, and I think that 114 months is the right amount for -- for the seriousness of the crime and the deterrence. How could you appeal that? I guess my -- I -- I have a great deal of understanding that having the judge say something makes sentencing appear to the public as being less than arbitrary. And there is a value in explanation that -- that -- that the justice system should consider. The question is how much and why checking off a box is not enough, because I take the judge at his or her word that when they check off the box, they've done what 3553(a), I think it is, requires. But is there a difference between checking off a box and not checking off a box? General, can -- General, do you have a different position with respect to a denial of a motion for a reduction? If a judge just says sign this form and -- but denied the reduction, would you hold the same position? No, no, no. Take my fact situation. The judge denied -- basically denies -- after looking at everything, I deny this motion for reduction. Does that permit intelligent appellate review? So how about if a judge in the original sentence gives the low end of the guideline but in the -- in the revised reduction gives above the original guideline but below the sentence he gave now? Would that require more of an explanation than signing this form? The one thing I hate about absolute rules in this area, dislike intensely, is that why shouldn't we trust the court of appeals to determine how much information it needs or doesn't need to give meaningful appellate review? Some courts have said if you refuse to depart completely, you should explain why. Others have said but if you don't and you pick a sentence within the guidelines, we will infer that you've said enough if you signed the form. Others have said you should always give a little bit more. Another character -- category of court of appeals have done what the Tenth Circuit has done, but I think there's only two that have done what the Tenth Circuit has said. Why isn't it always up to the court of appeals to determine how much it needs to determine whether adequate review can be given? So assume there wasn't a form and that the judge's real reason was that he thinks blacks who commit this kind of crime should be punished severely. How are we supposed to know or check, or the public know or check, that racism didn't play a part in this? I'm not assuming that any judge would do this, but I'm assuming -- -- some impermissible motive is -- is at play. If we don't have any statement by the judge of what he or she is doing or some basic reference to why, how do we know? But if you know no reason, which is what Justice Kennedy started with, we don't really know why he picked 114. So -- so let's do a different hypothetical. The judge says: I gave the 114 because he got convicted of a prison in -- infraction that was at the highest level. And, in fact -- not the facts of this case -- the prison infraction was at the lowest level and didn't even result in anything except a warning. How would the appellate court know that the judge made a factual assumption that was erroneous in picking that 114? Yes. But what -- how do we know if they don't articulate -- -- their reason for doing something, that they're not -- that it's not based on an erroneous factual basis? No, but we should. I mean, when we're making a rule that says you never have to, as the Tenth Circuit has indicated, then we don't know if an impermissible factual or legal basis motivated the judge. And with factual, it's not intentional; it's just wrong. ",I be sorry i just do not understand what minimal mean if you be answer justice alito the way you do which be i can not imagine need anything more than a judge say I be go to grant a reduction but

hypothetical the judge say i give the because he get convict of a prison in infraction that be at the high level and in fact not the fact of this case the prison infraction be at the low level and do not even result in anything except a warning how would the appellate court know that the judge make a factual assumption that be erroneous in pick that yes but what how do we know if they do not articulate their reason for do something that they be not that it be not base on an erroneous factual basis no but we should i mean when we be make a rule that say you never have to as the tenth circuit have indicate then we do not know if an impermissible factual or legal basis motivate the judge and with factual it be not intentional it be just wrong ,424.91,Roberts Court,"Apr 23,

2017,Currier v. Virginia,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Doesn't it -- Doesn't -- I'm sorry. Why do you say that? Meaning, what Nevada says is no severance, if both parties consent. So why isn't that exactly like Nevada? If you hadn't consented, severance would have been required, correct? Yeah -- Well, it requires -- -- severance unless both parties agree. Right. I don't know why that's not the same. Meaning it -- That's Turner. All right. So Turner says that. Why is this any different? This says -- Okay. Mr. Fisher, the government -- Mr. Fisher, what would happen in those bifurcated trials where -- it happens routinely in the Second Circuit: Same jury, you try the breaking and entering first or the robbery first, and then you try the felon-in-possession. Would double jeopardy bar the trial of the gun once there's been a conviction on the first charge, on the robbery or the breaking and entering? Under Jeffers. But what you're saying is if there's not, if there's an acquittal, that issue preclusion would bar the second trial? That's Turner? By the way, it was the government who went to the defendant and said consent to or agree to the severed trials? Yes. And just so we state the default rule clearly, to have a -- to have a joint trial, both parties have to agree; otherwise, law mandates severance? Mr. Fisher, don't we have a case that says this issue preclusion is only between the same parties? And we have a case that says, if another defendant gets an acquittal, that doesn't help you? How can you call this an agreement? State law says you're entitled to severance unless both of you consent to joinder. So, under state law, they have an absolute right to severance. So they're agreeing to what the law gives them? Well, that begs -- that begs the question. It needs to be severed under state law. Now that's the question. Can you agree to give something up because you're going to be damaged if you don't? If you -- I mean, why are you conditioning a defendant's right to separate trials on him giving up the prejudice argument of a joint trial? He's entitled to a separate trial. Why does he need to give it up? It's not a -- It's not a benefit; it's a right. So there's no right to an appeal, but we have said -- no constitutional right to an appeal, you're entitled to it statutorily, but we've said it's unfair, a Hobbesian choice, to force a defendant to give up his right to appeal to retain his double jeopardy rights. So why is it not a Hobson's choice to be forced to give up the prejudice of a joint trial in order to retain the double jeopardy rights? Uh-huh. Well, you've already been -- you've already been tried. The state -- the state has made a different determination. The state has said that presumptively these charges are prejudicial if they're tried together, and presumptively we won't permit it. No, but that's not true, because it gives not just the defendant but the state the right. The defendant can't do it by himself or herself. The state has to agree to it as well. Well, it went -- it didn't ask for one. What it said to the defendant was: We have to sever. Do you agree? And the defendant said: Yeah, we have to. How about if he had stood up and simply said: Do you agree? You say: Judge, that's what the law says. All right. So he has -- he has no rights under Virginia law, is what you're saying -- -- to maintain his -- he has to go to trial and suffer the prejudice to be able to retain his double jeopardy claims? I'm sorry, what's technically distinct about having committed a robbery against two people? If you rob each person, those are distinct crimes. But we don't permit you to try a person for robbing one person and then try the second crime, which is not technically distinct, it's distinct completely, there are different people involved. We don't let you try that second person, that second crime. If you've been acquitted. What would have happened here if the defendant got up and said Virginia law requires separate trials. I won't -- I want what the law gives me. I won't waive my double jeopardy rights. What then does the court do and what then does the prosecutor do? ",do not it do not I be sorry why do you say that meaning what nevada say be no severance if both party consent so why be not that exactly like nevada if you have not consent severance would have be require correct yeah well it require severance unless both party agree right i do not know why that be not the same mean it that be turner all right so turner say that why be this any different this say okay mr fisher the government mr fisher what would happen in those bifurcate trial where it happen routinely in the second circuit same jury you try the breaking and enter first or the robbery first and then you try the felon in possession would double jeopardy bar the trial of the gun once there be be a conviction on the first charge on the robbery or the breaking and entering under jeffers but what you be say be if there be not if there be an acquittal that issue preclusion would bar the second trial that be turner by the way it be the government who go to the defendant and say consent to or agree to the sever trial yes and just so we state the default rule clearly to have a to have a joint trial both party have to agree otherwise law mandate severance mr fisher do not we have a case that say this issue preclusion be only between the same party and we have a case that say if another defendant get an acquittal that do not help you how can you call this an agreement state law say you be entitle to severance unless both of you consent to joinder so under state law they have an absolute right to severance so they be agree to what the law give them well that beg that beg the question it need to be sever under state law now that be the question can you agree to give something up because you be go to be damage if you do not if you i mean why be you condition a defendant s right to separate trial on him give up the prejudice argument of a joint trial he be entitle to a separate trial why do he need to give it up it be not a it be not a benefit it be a right so there be no right to an appeal but we have say no constitutional right to an appeal you be entitle to it statutorily but we have say it be unfair a hobbesian choice to force a defendant to give up his right to appeal to retain his double jeopardy right so why be it not a hobson s choice to be force to give up the prejudice of a joint trial in order to retain the double jeopardy right uh huh well you have already be you have already be try the state the state have make a different determination the state have say that presumptively these charge be prejudicial if they be try together and presumptively we will not permit it no but that be not true because it give not just the defendant but the state the right the defendant can not do it by himself or herself the state have to agree to it as well well it go it do not ask for one what it say to the defendant be we have to sever do you agree and the defendant say yeah we have to how about if he have stand up and simply say do you agree you say judge that be what the law say all right so he have he have no right under virginia law be what you be say to maintain his he have to go to trial and suffer the prejudice to be able to retain his double jeopardy claim I be sorry what be technically distinct about have commit a robbery against two people if you rob each person those be distinct crime but we do not permit you to try a person for rob one person and then try the second crime which be not technically distinct it be distinct completely there be different people involve we do not let you try that second person that second crime if you have be acquit what would have happen here if the defendant get up and say virginia law require separate trial i will not i want what the law give me i will not waive my double jeopardy right what then do the court do and what then do the prosecutor do ,295.0,Roberts Court,"Feb 20, 2018",Michael N.

2017,Husted v. A. Philip Randolph Institute,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"So why bother -- This is a very complicated system for a very simple position. If you have any reason to believe someone has changed address, just send them a notice and, after two election cycles, disqualify them. Why have the Post Office provision at all? Why have any other provision? As it is, I understand Ohio now is not waiting for people to miss two election cycles; they're waiting -- every year they're purging, right? Every year. Now, you have taken the position in your brief that you really don't need anything; you need -- you could send out a notice any time, any place, and if someone fails to respond to it, you can purge them. Isn't that your position? But my point is you don't even need the failure to vote two years to use the notice -- Well, let -- let's -- The Senate report that supported the NVRA explicitly says that what they wanted to avoid was a mailing that is unresponded to being a cause for removing someone. So if that was its purpose, why wouldn't it make sense that the only reason that you can change -- send the notice is if you have some reasonable basis to believe someone has moved? Failure to vote can't it be it because the Senate report says that they believe the failure to vote was a constitutional right. You have a right not to vote. So why have the three provisions having to do with the Post Office notice? That seems like a very reasonable -- why -- why do you need it at all under your interpretation? Counsel, can you -- Can we get to the essence of this case? It appears as if what you're -- you're reading is that the failure to vote is enough evidence to suggest that someone has moved. That seems to be your position because it can be the only one. But is that a reasonable effort to draw that conclusion when you do results in disenfranchising, disproportionately, certain cities where large groups of minorities live, where large groups of homeless people live, and across the country they're the group that votes the least, in -- in large measure because many of them work very long hours. And without the golden week that Ohio rescinded, many of them can't vote because the polls are not open while they're not working. Places like Cleveland have very, very, very long lines of -- of voter -- of voters trying to vote. All of these impediments result in large numbers of people not voting in certain spots in the state. So if the word ""reasonable effort"" has any meaning with a Congress who said that the failure to vote is a constitutional right, how can we read this statute to permit you to begin a process of disenfranchising solely on the basis of that with no independent evidence whatsoever that the person has moved? You can use the Post Office. They tell you that. You can use Certified Mail. You could use juror change of addresses. You can use driver license, motor vehicle change of addresses. There are dozens of other ways that you could verify a change of address, yet you're suggesting that using a failure to appear at an election or elections as evidence of moving when people have a right not to vote if they choose. Many have. And others like the veteran who's a plaintiff in this case explains the reasons why he failed to vote in two elections. I have to give the meaning, the words that Congress said, don't use the failure to vote as a result -- that results in someone being disenfranchised. I don't understand how you can say that the failure to vote can be used as the sole basis for sending out notices. It's not a reasonable inference, so how could it be a reasonable effort? So if that's minimum, don't you think that maximum should say something a little bit more than the failure to vote? I mean, you know, a change in the residence in accordance with (b), (c), and (d), and (b) has you using the Post Office, correct? (c) has you using the Post Office. (b) says shall not be removed -- shall not result in the removal of the name of a person from any official list registered to vote in election for federal office by reason of the person's failure to vote. So -- Well -- Exactly. We're saying it's not a sole -- So please explain to me why a change of address is reasonable. What -- what are the statistics that show that the vast majority of people that you disenfranchise from voting, that you strike from the election rolls have actually moved? No, when it gave you an example, it gave you an example of an independent trigger. So there's a minimum requirement on the voter who gets your notice to respond. But that's after you have evidence that they've actually moved? Well, that's the problem, is -- -- that there's a strong argument this is -- that at least in impact, this is discriminatory. I understand that some don't believe in impact, but you have to look at it to determine -- -- whether something is reasonable. General, could you tell me, there's a 24-year history of solicitor generals of both political parties under both -- presidents of both political parties who have taken a position contrary to yours. Before the amendment and after the amendment. In fact, the Federal Election Commission, when it wrote to Congress with respect to the Help America Vote Act, took the position the old solicitor generals were taking. Everybody but you today come in and say the Act before the clarification said something different. Seems quite unusual that your office would change its position so dramatically. I might accept it if you thought that the Help America Vote Act, in fact, clarified something that was ambiguous, but you're taking a very different position. You're saying even before that Act, it was clear you could do it this way. Well, so please explain the change of position. After that many presidents, that many solicitor generals, this many years -- the vast majority of states, over 35 -- over 40, actually, who read it the way your opponents read it, most people read it that way -- how did the solicitor general change its mind? Do you believe this doesn't have an impact, a negative impact on certain groups in this society? So point me where in the legislative history people say that with absolute clarity. As I understand the legislative history, both sides are saying, in its history, this helps us. So it's as ambiguous as the language may be. I'm sorry, Mr. Smith. I thought I read it was 40 or 50 percent. Mr. Smith, there is one thing about -- and I maybe should have asked this of -- of Ohio -- of the state. But, once you don't return the notice, you get put on the inactive list, correct? That means that you no longer -- does it mean you no longer get mailings about elections? You're not sent any more reminders about -- It's one notice in four -- six years. And -- and -- and you disappear from any further mailings. I'm sure Mr. Murphy will -- -- correct it if it's wrong. Mr. Smith, could you give me concrete numbers? How many voters have been purged as a result of this system? But you gave me 3 percent of people nationally move. I -- I guess what I'm trying to get to is about how many people in Michigan actually move? I'm sorry, I misspoke. In Ohio. I don't know. Three percent of what? I -- I understand that. But what's the -- 3 percent of what greater number? Of all people in the country. So we have to divide it up and do that math. I'm sorry, they don't get -- people don't get notice that they have been struck. They get one notice, they're put on the inactive list. Was I correct about that? I'm not asking -- Under Ohio's law, do they get only one notice? They don't get a notice when they're purged. So they don't know they've been purged. They have to go to the polls to find that out. Well, that -- that's -- Would you answer my question? Are they ever sent, anyone who's sent a notice and put on the inactive list, are they ever again sent any voting information outside of this ERIC program? ",so why bother this be a very complicated system for a very simple position if you have any reason to believe someone have change address just send them a notice and after two election cycle disqualify them why have the post office provision at all why have any other provision as it be i understand ohio now be not wait for people to miss two election cycle they be wait every year they be purge right every year now you have take the position in your brief that you really do not need anything you need you could send out a notice any time any place and if someone fail to respond to it you can purge them be not that your position but my point be you do not even need the failure to vote two year to use the notice well let let us the senate report that support the nvra explicitly say that what they want to avoid be a mailing that be unresponded to be a because for remove someone so if that be its purpose why would not it make sense that the only reason that you can change send the notice be if you have some reasonable basis to believe someone have move failure to vote can not it be it because the senate report say that they believe the failure to vote be a constitutional right you have a right not to vote so why have the three provision have to do with the post office notice that seem like a very reasonable why why do you need it at all under your interpretation counsel can

2017,SAS Institute Inc. v. Iancu,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"It was only instituted with respect to certain claims. So I have two questions. I'm not at all clear what it is you're challenging here. Are you challenging the Board's right to initiate partial adjudications or are you challenging the fact that they are not addressing all of the claims in their final decision? What is it that you're actually asking us to review? So what is it exactly that you want the Board to do with respect to the claims that it didn't grant adjudication of? So you want them to say we didn't grant review on these claims because? Or do you want them to say the patent is valid with respect to these claims that we didn't grant review? Because the only -- the only power they're given is to decide the patentability of claims. So what exactly is it that you're asking them to do? Ahh, you want to get around Cuozzo. That -- that's exactly what you want to do. You want to -- Well, I don't see what else you're trying to do, because what will you do? You will come up on appeal and say the Board was wrong in not instituting review of those other claims? That's what Cuozzo was about, us saying you can't do that. I didn't agree with Cuozzo, so -- -- you know, I mean -- But -- but -- but it is what we said. And -- and so, assuming I stick with precedent on this issue, what other purpose would there be for the Board basically to say we made a decision not to institute review? All right. You do want to get around Cuozzo. Because there is absolutely no way that that's anything other than that. What's the -- if you're not challenging their decision not to institute review, why would that make any difference? So would the review on appeal be on the basis of a motion -- like a motion to dismiss? On the face of whatever you presented the Board with, at the beginning, did the Board have a reasonable basis to conclude that no reasonable basis existed to challenge the validity of that claim? So how could we -- how could the appellate court make that determination if there's no record with respect to that issue? If -- No, no, I -- If the Board didn't institute review of those claims, there would be an incomplete record with respect to those other claims. Well, that's fine. But if the Board didn't institute review of those other claims, the other side has not had an opportunity to present its evidence in contravention of your expert. You're asking the appellate court to decide patentability on the basis of an incomplete, undeveloped record. All right. So why don't you get to the first issue at all? What you really want to say is the Board shouldn't institute partial reviews; it should, if it finds -- I think what you're saying is, once it determines you have enough evidence to challenge one claim, it should hold a hearing on everything. Because without that, you can't really decide patentability in a due process way, in a fair way. So why have you limited your challenge in the way you have? What's the purpose of doing that? And what advantage does that give you? It seems to me that it's an unfair advantage to the other side. It's an unfair advantage to the system. So why don't you just argue what you really want to argue, which is, I should have an opportunity to litigate all of my claims? I'm sorry. How did you do that for years? It's a year and a half, isn't it, at most? It's usually a year. How long did it take here? A year and a half or a year? All right. Why bother -- why bother requiring you to set forth all your grounds for every claim you choose to challenge? Because nothing in this forces you to challenge the claims in inter partes review. So you could choose -- you could have chosen to challenge four and still gone back to district court and challenged all 16 in district court. So this was never -- so this was never intended to capture all litigation over validity? So -- so why bother requiring you to set forth all your grounds, particularly if you only really have to do it with respect to one? You could take your strongest case, set forth all the grounds there, and on the others, say, we also want to challenge all the other 15 because, under your theory, you don't have to do anything more than that. You just have to identify one claim that's weak. The Board says, we'll institute review, and then you're entitled to challenge all the other claims that you didn't set forth with particularity. Because the Board has to give you a hearing on those claims anyway. But you don't -- you want that, but it doesn't mean the other side wants that. It doesn't mean that the Board needs that. You think it's an inherent right. Could you show me where -- anywhere in this statute the Board is prohibited directly from initiation -- initiating partial review? Of some claims -- of some claims or not? And how? Assume there's not -- I find that 314 -- -- permits -- it has no direct prohibition of partial institution, that the Board is entitled to do that, then why would we have to read the language ""patent claims challenged by the petitioner"" any different than the Board is reading it? The Board is reading it to -- to mean any patent claim challenged by the Petitioner at the review stage. Well, there is one very telling sign that the ""any patent claim challenged by the petitioner"" has a different meaning, and that's in 314 itself, which says ""claims challenged in the petition."" If Congress intended claims challenged in the petition to be a part of 318, it could have used exactly the same words. I thought -- -- that that was the very reason given by the Board in encouraging these kinds of opinions to be written. So the Patent Board basically told the public, we're issuing these decisions for educational purposes? Let me ask you -- You talked about canceled claims. How about settled claims? Say, in the middle of the proceedings, you settle a claim. Under your theory, the Board would still have to address that? It's in the petition. What gives you a right to drop it then? ",it be only instituted with respect to certain claim so i have two question I be not at all clear what it be you be challenge here be you challenge the board s right to initiate partial adjudication or be you challenge the fact that they be not address all of the claim in their final decision what be it that you be actually ask us to review so what be it exactly that you want the board to do with respect to the claim that it do not grant adjudication of so you want them to say we do not grant review on these claim because or do you want them to say the patent be valid with respect to these claim that we do not grant review because the only the only power they be give be to decide the patentability of claim so what exactly be it that you be ask them to do ahh you want to get around cuozzo that that be exactly what you want to do you want to well i do not see what else you be try to do because what will you do you will come up on appeal and say the board be wrong in not institute review of those other claim that be what cuozzo be about us say you can not do that i do not agree with cuozzo so you know i mean but but but it be what we say and and so assume i stick with precedent on this issue what other purpose would there be for the board basically to say we make a decision not to institute review all right you do want to get around cuozzo because there be absolutely no way that that be anything other than that what be the if you be not challenge their decision not to institute review why would that make any difference so would the review on appeal be on the basis of a motion like a motion to dismiss on the face of whatever you present the board with at the beginning do the board have a reasonable basis to conclude that no reasonable basis exist to challenge the validity of that claim so how could we how could the appellate court make that determination if there be no record with respect to that issue if no no i if the board do not institute review of those claim there would be an incomplete record with respect to those other claim well that be fine but if the board do not institute review of those other claim the other side have not have an opportunity to present its evidence in contravention of your expert you be ask the appellate court to decide patentability on the basis of an incomplete undeveloped record all right so why do not you get to the first issue at all what you really want to say be the board should not institute partial review it should if it find i think what you be say be once it determine you have enough evidence to challenge one claim it should hold a hearing on everything because without that you can not really decide patentability in a due process way in a fair way so why have you limit your challenge in the way you have what be the purpose of do that and what advantage do that give you it seem to me that it be an unfair advantage to the other side it be an unfair advantage to the system so why do not you just argue what you really want to argue which be i should have an opportunity to litigate all of my claim I be sorry how do you do that for year it be a year and a half be not it at most it be usually a year how long do it take here a year and a half or a year all right why bother why bother require you to set forth all your ground for every claim you choose to challenge because nothing in this force you to challenge the claim in inter partes review so you could choose you could have choose to challenge four and still go back to district court and challenge all in district court so this be never so this be never intend to capture all litigation over validity so so why bother require you to set forth all your ground particularly if you only really have to do it with respect to one you could take your strong case set forth all the ground there and on the others say we also want to challenge all the other because under your theory you do not have to do anything more than that you just have to identify one claim that be weak the board say we will institute review and then you be entitle to challenge all the other claim that you do not set forth with particularity because the board have to give you a hearing on those claim anyway but you do not you want that but it do not mean the other side want that it do not mean that the board need that you think it be an inherent right could you show me where anywhere in this statute the board be prohibit directly from initiation initiate partial review of some claim of some claim or not and how assume there be not i find that permit it have no direct prohibition of partial institution that the board be entitle to do that then why would we have to read the language patent claim challenge by the petitioner any different than the board be read it the board be read it to to mean any patent claim challenge by the petitioner at the review stage well there be one very tell sign that the any patent claim challenge by the petitioner have a different meaning and that be in itself which say claim challenge in the petition if congress intend claim challenge in the petition to be a part of it could have use exactly the same word i think that that be the very reason give by the board in encourage these kind of opinion to be write so the patent board basically tell the public we be issue these decision for educational purpose let me

2017,Jennings v. Rodriguez,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"What would be the constitutional entitlement to keeping those people, if they're not a flight risk or a -- a risk to the safety of the country? Or to others? However you want to define that danger element. So what's the constitutional entitlement, just arbitrarily, to keep someone who's neither of those two things? May I ask a -- Clarifying question. For an alien who is found in the United States illegally, has not been admitted, are they held under 1225(b) or are they held under 1226(a)? So what happens to -- I don't know how many of these would exist, but an alien who has resided within 14 miles of the border, not 14 -- how many miles? Hundred miles from the border, that's possible, who has been there for 20 years, they would still be held under 1225? I'm assuming no criminal alien. I'm talking about an alien who has come into the United States illegally without being admitted who takes up residence 50 miles from the border. Let me finish my -- your question. Earlier you said you were objecting to the burden of proof. Are you objecting to the concept that prolonged detention without reason is not appropriate for these aliens? And the reasons being flight risk or danger. Except that that bond hearing, that additional regulation says that the length of detention is not one of the factors that justifies reconsideration. And so if these are people who have been here for decades, let's say, don't you think due process would require some periodic review to ensure that these people are properly being held? Except that regulations are saying that you don't consider the length of detention. But that's what a judge does in bail hearings. That's what a judge does in almost every other detention, which is, at a certain point, your -- your calculus changes, the balance changes when the detention becomes unreasonable. The length of detention becomes unreasonable. So when is it, in theory -- -- when it's not the alien's fault, and you seem to suggest that if budgetary matters or personnel matters are what are inflicting the delay that that's okay. Is there any -- you said 20 years is the end point. But given that we have a due process right not to be held indefinitely, even though it may have a distant point of release somewhere in an unknown period, because the government now, I understand, if a alien asks for an adjournment, BIA judges who are overbooked are sometimes taking months to give them another date. At what point does the government's behavior come into this analysis? Intentionally or not. I mean, I would assume that if the government was just delaying because it wanted to, you would say that's unconstitutional. All right. But at what point does indefinite, albeit with a lengthy, far-off detention date, become unconstitutional? No. What makes it unconstitutional in my mind is the unreasonable delay or detention. Well, how about the ABA amicus brief here? Is that -- go ahead. We are in an upended world when we think 14 months or 19 months is a reasonable time to detain a person. -- understand that. But you would think that that process, at least with respect to 1226(b), is to ensure that the person is not a flight risk or a danger. So tell me why the regulations under 1226(a) are inadequate. There is an entitlement -- Zadvydas is an administrative -- or the response by the BIA or the INS, whatever they're calling it today, was to create an administrative process. So why is the one here inadequate? Well, standing on its own -- -- those aliens -- those aliens who have been here for a long time but didn't commit a crime. Why are those arguments not available in the administrative process? I'm looking just at that statute. I know you want to look at 1225 and 1226(c), but I'm looking just at 1226(a). Periodic review of long-term detentions under 1226(a). But you're not -- you're not arguing that they have to be, like the Ninth Circuit said, a court review. It can be simply an administrative review. But you're not -- you're not -- you wouldn't be quarrelling if it was an immigration judge. And that's not what exists today? I'm trying to concentrate on 1226(a). What's wrong with the administrative process? As it exists today. That -- that's pretty hard to do with 1226(c) -- -- when 1226(a) says this applies to everything but. The statute is pretty clear on that. So why is the Zadvydas -- this went -- the Ninth Circuit remedy went a lot further than Zadvydas did. Zadvydas just created a presumption, or did away from -- with a presumption. Here the court is actually requiring -- What gives you the right to parole? ",what would be the constitutional entitlement to keep those people if they be not a flight risk or a a risk to the safety of the country or to others however you want to define that danger element so what be the constitutional entitlement just arbitrarily to keep someone who be neither of those two thing may i ask a clarify question for an alien who be find in the united state illegally have not be admit be they hold under b or be they hold under a so what happen to i do not know how many of these would exist but an alien who have reside within mile of the border not how many mile hundred mile from the border that be possible who have be there for year they would still be hold under I be assume no criminal alien I be talk about an alien who have come into the united state illegally without be admit who take up residence mile from the border let me finish my your question earlier you say you we be object to the burden of proof be you object to the concept that prolong detention without reason be not appropriate for these alien and the reason be flight risk or danger except that that bond hearing that additional regulation say that the length of detention be not one of the factor that justifies reconsideration and so if these be people who have be here for decade let us say do not you think due process would require some periodic review to ensure that these people be properly be hold except that regulation be say that you do not consider the length of detention but that be what a judge do in bail hearing that be what a judge do in almost every other detention which be at a certain point your your calculus change the balance change when the detention become unreasonable the length of detention becomes unreasonable so when be it in theory when it be not the alien s fault and you seem to suggest that if budgetary matter or personnel matter be what be inflict the delay that that be okay be there any you say year be the end point but give that we have a due process right not to be hold indefinitely even though it may have a distant point of release somewhere in an unknown period because the government now i understand if a alien ask for an adjournment bia judge who be overbooked be sometimes take month to give them another date at what point do the government s behavior come into this analysis intentionally or not i mean i would assume that if the government be just delay because it want to you would say that be unconstitutional all right but at what point do indefinite albeit with a lengthy far off detention date become unconstitutional no what make it unconstitutional in my mind be the unreasonable delay or detention well how about the aba amicus brief here be that go ahead we be in an upended world when we think month or month be a reasonable time to detain a person understand that but you would think that that process at least with respect to b be to ensure that the person be not a flight risk or a danger so tell me why the regulation under a be inadequate there be an entitlement zadvydas be an administrative or the response by the bia or the in whatever they be call it today be to create an administrative process so why be the one here inadequate well stand on its own those alien those alien who have be here for a long time but do not commit a crime why be those argument not available in the administrative process I be look just at that statute i know you want to look at and c but I be look just at a periodic review of long term detention under a but you be not you be not argue that they have to be like the ninth circuit say a court review it can be simply an administrative review but you be not you be not you would not be quarrel if it be an immigration judge and that be not what exist today I be try to concentrate on a what be wrong with the administrative process as it exist today that that be pretty hard to do with c when a say this apply to everything but the statute be pretty clear on that so why be the zadvydas this go the ninth circuit remedy go a lot far than zadvydas do zadvydas just create a presumption or do away from with a presumption here the court be actually require what give you the right to parole ,341.48,Roberts Court,"Nov 30, 2016","David Jennings, et al.","Alejandro Rodriguez, et al.",15-1204,"Jun 20, 2016","Feb 27, 2018",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2017,Carpenter v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I'm sorry, which -- in which way are you talking about? What rule? But Justice Ginsburg is not asking you about 24 hours or anything else. She's asking you about a tower dump. A crime happens at a bank, the teller says or doesn't say that the robber -- she saw the robber on the phone at some point. Could the police just get a tower dump of the cell site to see who was in that area at that time? So what's the difference between a tower dump and targeting a particular individual? Let's say an anonymous call came in that said John X or John Doe was at a particular -- was the robber. Could the police then say to the telephone company let me see the records of John Doe for that hour or for that day or whatever the -- the duration of the crime was? All right. So differentiate that situation. But isn't that the same concern here? And that's why I -- I'm differentiating between incident-related searches and basically dragnet searches when you're looking at what a person is doing over 127, 30, 40, even 24 hours, which is it's not related to any legitimate police need to invade the privacy of a person over a 24-hour period, unless there's a suggestion that the crime occurred during that entire 24-hour period. So that's why I asked you is there a difference between saying if police have cause to believe a crime has been committed, can they ask for records related to that individual crime, even if it happened on one day, a second day, a fourth day, a 10th day, so long as they're limiting their search as related to a criminal activity, as opposed to a dragnet sweep of everybody's intimate details? Because right now we're only talking about the cell sites records, but as I understand it, a cell phone can be pinged in your bedroom. It can be pinged at your doctor's office. It can ping you in the most intimate details of your life. Presumably at some point even in a dressing room as you're undressing. So I am not beyond the belief that someday a provider could turn on my cell phone and listen to my conversations. So I'm not sure where your 24-hour rule comes from. Shouldn't your rule be based on incident-related rather than the essence of your complaint, which is that we're permitting police to do a dragnet search of your life? Are we -- are we radically extending them? From the very beginning, Smith, for example, basically said the disclosure at issue doesn't disclose the content of the conversation. As the dissent pointed out, the provider had access to the -- to the content of the conversation. Yet, we drew a line in saying cell phone numbers -- telephone numbers are disclosable because everybody knows that the telephone company is keeping track of those numbers. You get it in your phone bill at the end of each month. But we said people don't know or even if they realize that the phone company can listen in to their conversation, that there's a reasonable expectation that the phone company won't, absent some urgent circumstance, a death threat, almost a special needs circumstance. That suggests, as you started to say earlier, that it never was an absolute rule, the third-party doctrine. We limited it when -- in Bond and Ferguson when we said police can't get your medical records without your consent, even though you've disclosed your medical records to doctors at a hospital. They can't touch your bag to feel what's in your bag because an individual may disclose his or her bag to the public. I think one of my colleagues here said you can -- why shouldn't people expect others to touch their bag as well? Well, and the Court said no because you expose what your bag looks like, but you don't have an expectation that people are going to touch your bag. So is it really that far off to say, yes, I can believe that my location at one moment or other moments might be searched by police, but I don't expect them to track me down for 24 hours over 127 days? But asking -- No, they don't give it to the bank. They give it to a person, who gives it to the bank. It's a big difference. Mr. Dreeben, why is it not okay, in the way we said about beepers, to plant a beeper in somebody's bedroom, but it's okay to get the cell phone records of someone who I -- I don't, but I know that most young people have the phones in the bed with them. (Laughter.) All right? I know people who take phones into public restrooms. They take them with them everywhere. It's an appendage now for some people. If it's not okay to put a beeper into someone's bedroom, why is it okay to use the signals that phone is using from that person's bedroom, made accessible to law enforcement without probable cause? That's today, Mr. Dreeben, but we need to look at this with respect to how the technology is developing. You -- we can beep phones in a bedroom now. Well, this is no different than a telephone company having access to your telephone conversations. But we protected those -- -- in Smith. Yeah, but -- but an -- in an envelope, you seal the envelope. You can -- you can yourself control the public disclosure. But with telephones, the telephone company could have plugged in and listened to your conversation just as easily as these telecommunications companies can read your e-mails if they choose. Yet, we've said we would protect e-mail content. Mr. Dreeben, what do you do with the survey mentioned by your opposing colleague that says that most Americans, I still think, want to avoid Big Brother. They want to avoid the concept that government will be able to see and locate you anywhere you are at any point in time. Is it -- do you really believe that people expect that the government will be able to do that without probable cause and a warrant? The -- the Constitution protects the rights of people to be secure. Isn't it a fundamental concept, don't you think, that that would include the government searching for information about your location every second of the day -- -- for months and months at a time? Well, the question is, was it -- the fact that Congress recognized how sensitive this information is, is quite laudatory, but did it understand the measure of the constitutional requirement of what protections should be given to that? I mean, I -- I can defer to Congress's understanding of the privacy needs, but does that create an obligation for me to defer to their judgment of what protections the Constitution requires? The Constitution has always said government can't intrude, except in some carefully defined situation, special needs being foremost among them -- can't intrude on those privacy interests without a warrant. We're not saying they can't ever. They've just got to have articulable facts based on reliable information, sworn to in an affidavit, that can provide probable cause to believe that this individual is involved in criminal activity. That's not a new standard. That's an old standard. But we have -- -- we have said -- you know, we have made exceptions all the time, Ferguson, Bond, even in creating Smith and Miller, we created an exception. People disclose the content of telephone calls to third parties. But we said the government can't intrude without a warrant in that situation. Could the government say to telecommunications providers, you cannot use this kind of information, you can't keep it? So what's the difference between that and saying, if you want to create this information, you are taking this information from customers and it's the customer's information? You can't disclose it without the customer saying yea or nay. Isn't what that Congress did? Well, but then we -- then you're begging the question, which is Justice Gorsuch's question, which is: What's the -- what does the law, the Fourth Amendment, require in those circumstances? You're -- you're saying Congress can set the level of what the Constitution requires, but I don't know that that's true. But that's -- But that's begging the question. Is it the third-party's information when Congress says it's customer information? How would -- how would you like to lose? (Laughter.) ",I be sorry which in which way be you talk about what rule but justice ginsburg be not ask you about hour or anything else she be ask you about a tower dump a crime happen at a bank the teller say or do not say that the robber she saw the robber on the phone at some point could the police just get a tower dump of the cell site to see who be in that area at that time so what be the difference

company let me see the record of john doe for that hour or for that day or whatever the the duration of the crime be all right so differentiate that situation but be not that the same concern here and that be why i I be differentiate between incident relate search and basically dragnet search when you be look at what a person be do over even hour which be it be not relate to any legitimate police

2017,Rosales-Mireles v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mrs. Davidson -- Ms. Davidson, I think of the three prongs, the third and the fourth prong, the third prong as being fairness of process: Were you given the process that you were entitled to constitutionally or statutorily? And so, on the third prong, we've had many cases where elements were not given to a jury. This is neither case. We've had Cotton, where a drug amount wasn't given to a jury. We look at that third prong as a substantial deprivation of some form of constitutional or state right. I think of the fourth prong as fairness of the ultimate outcome, which is very different because often, like in Cotton, where an element like drug amount wasn't given to a jury, we look at the quantum of evidence and say: Would the outcome have been different? And that's most of our cases. Was the area -- error so substantial that the outcome was actually unfair? And so, for me, that fourth prong does serve even in sentencing guidelines a different function. It talks -- our third-prong finding is that the fairness of a judge's process of considering your sentence from a correct guideline was frustrated. The third -- fourth prong goes to, is there a substantial possibility that the outcome was affected, that you would have received a lesser sentence? Is there an error in the way I'm looking at this? Well, I think your -- your point in your brief was he got, at the low end of the guidelines, 78 months, despite all of the negative factors that the government points to in its brief, his serious criminal history, et cetera, et cetera. The judge still sentenced him at the low end of the guideline. And so that demonstrates that it is possible, not just substantially possible, but that the judge will in fairness and upholding the integrity of the judiciary give him a lesser sentence, correct? It's a possibility -- a strong possibility? I'm sorry -- -- when -- when you're talking about reasonableness, it seems like you're doing substantive reasonableness, which is what the Fifth Circuit was doing with its standard. It borrowed a substantive due process right or standard, shock the conscience, and applied it to this sentence. And it sounds like, with all your three reasons and your argument, which is the only thing that matters is that it doesn't -- that this is a reasonable sentence no matter if it's not the sentence the district court would have given. That's basically your argument, isn't it? All right. But why? When the three prongs of the fourth -- the three arms of the fourth prong say fairness, integrity, or -- I've forgotten the fourth, but it's in -- Public reputation. ""Or"" is disjunctive, not conjunctive. So why isn't it unfair? But that's a procedural right. That's not a substantive right. That's not what this fourth prong says. What this fourth prong appears to say is the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of our judicial system. What's fair about an error that the judge, in part, was a part of that could be easily corrected and that might very well result in a lower sentence to a defendant? What's fair about not correcting that error? ",mrs davidson ms davidson i think of the three prong the third and the fourth prong the third prong as be fairness of process we be you give the process that you we be entitle to constitutionally or statutorily and so on the third prong we have have many case where element we be not give to a jury this be neither case we have have cotton where a drug amount be not give to a jury we look at that third prong as a substantial deprivation of some form of constitutional or state right i think of the fourth prong as fairness of the ultimate outcome which be very different because often like in cotton where an element like drug amount be not give to a jury we look at the quantum of evidence and say would the outcome have be different and that be most of our case be the area error so substantial that the outcome be actually unfair and so for me that fourth prong do serve even in sentence guideline a different function it talk our third prong finding be that the fairness of a judge s process of consider your sentence from a correct guideline be frustrate the third fourth prong go to be there a substantial possibility that the outcome be affect that you would have receive a less sentence be there an error in the way I be look at this well i think your your point in your brief be he get at the low end of the guideline month despite all of the negative factor that the government point to in its brief his serious criminal history et cetera et cetera the judge still sentence him at the low end of the guideline and so that demonstrate that it be possible not just substantially possible but that the judge will in fairness and uphold the integrity of the judiciary give him a less sentence correct it be a possibility a strong possibility I be sorry when when you be talk about reasonableness it seem like you be do substantive reasonableness which be what the fifth circuit be do with its standard it borrow a substantive due process right or standard shock the conscience and apply it to this sentence and it sound like with all your three reason and your argument which be the only thing that matter be that it do not that this be a reasonable sentence no matter if it be not the sentence the district court would have give that be basically your argument be not it all right but why when the three prong of the fourth the three arm of the fourth prong say fairness integrity or I have forget the fourth but it be in public reputation or be disjunctive not conjunctive so why be not it unfair but that be a procedural right that be not a substantive right that be not what this fourth prong say what this fourth prong appear to say be the fairness integrity or public reputation of our judicial system what be fair about an error that the judge in part be a part of that could be easily correct and that might very well result in a low sentence to a defendant what be fair about not correct that error ,243.25,Roberts Court,"Feb 21, 2018",Florencio Rosales-Mireles,United States of America,16-9493,"Sep 28, 2017","Jun 18, 2018",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2017,"Merit Management Group v. FTI Consulting, Inc.",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I'm sorry, who's insecure about that? The banks or the person to whom the money was ultimately sent? Well, I understood that the safe harbor was not intended to protect people involved in financial transactions. That's always a risk whenever you get into a deal that's contingent on any basis. Congress wanted to do that, why bother even creating the fraudulent transfer provisions? Just say any contract that any of these people sign in any of these fields is exempt. Going -- going back to this transfer question. The fraudulent-transfer provision says the trustee may avoid any transfer or any obligation. So it's not talking just about voiding a transfer; it's talking about voiding an obligation. Isn't the contractual obligation an obligation? Or a contractual rights obligation? So why can't a trustee choose what it is he or she wants to avoid, whether it's a transfer or an obligation? And that define the scope of who's involved? I'm sorry -- -- the -- here, debtor sold something to someone else or was obligated to send money ultimately to Merit. So how does that not fit into obligation? You think that -- -- obligation issue is one that's prospective and not -- I'm sorry. Perhaps it's simple -- Well, that -- actually, 550, I think, works very strongly against you because 550 says the trustee may recover for the benefit of the state the property transferred, so it seems to be talking about who has control and dominion of the property that the trustee is seeking to recover. They -- that's how they've defined it under 550. It makes common sense, which is -- -- go to who ultimately has control of the property. Exactly. May I address a question that confused me in your briefing? You kept saying that the initial transfer had to be by the debtor. But the code permits the trustee to void a non-debtor's transfer if the property that that non-debtor is transferring is of an interest of the debtor in property. So it's not so clean to say that the transfer has to be by the debtor. It can also be by the debtor's agent, a non-debtor. So that's how you're reading that then. So why -- but why then did you argue that the transfer from Credit Suisse to Citizens Bank -- both involved property of the debtor, why did you argue that that wouldn't qualify because it wasn't a transfer by the debtor? You don't think Credit Suisse or -- or Citizens Bank fell under the safe harbor automatically? They're both financial -- Oh, okay. That's what I'm -- Sorry. I thought that 550 said that post -- that transferees from Bedford could be protected by other safe havens, if they paid consideration in -- in good faith, et cetera, they would be okay? Right. Right.

2017,"Jesner v. Arab Bank, PLC",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"How about Daimler? Would Daimler -- -- apply here? Daimler, our personal jurisdiction case about corporations. You can only sue them at their corporate headquarters or principal place of business. Will that take care of most of the next 30 percent? I'm sorry. What amici brief was that you mentioned? I'm sorry to cut you off. Mr. Fletcher, could you answer the beginning question on the implications of a holding in this case in the Petitioners' favor? Why are you less worried about the international -- the impact on international relations? Your adversaries are telling us that we should be worried. I don't think that the -- the Congress would have been worried about an alien defendant if it had been a pirate. If an American ship was pirated, I don't think they would have not thought that the ATS was only available for suits against U.S. citizens. There's no international norm that makes people civilly liable for international torts. There's never been an international court that has held an individual responsible. The norm is the conduct, i.e., should you be financing terrorists or not? Should you commit piracy or not? Should you commit slavery, genocide, any of the other prohibited international acts against humanity? So, if there's no civil liability, international civil liability for an individual, was the ATS a violation of that norm, of the norm you're trying to create that doesn't exist? You or you or you the state or you as an individual. But the individual -- Mr. Clement, there were scholars here who pointed out that criminal law is different than civil, and the brief that was cited by Mr. Fisher points out that there are many, many nations that hold individuals and corporations civilly liable for violations of the international norms. So where do we find international norms, if not in the behavior of international companies -- of international countries? Don't they show us what the norm is? So Jordan is going to be okay -- Jordan is going to be okay being called a financier of terrorism merely because it's a U.S. citizen who brought this suit?

2017,"South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc.",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I'm sorry. Isn't the problem not Quill but the fact that you don't have a mechanism to collect from consumers? It's not the merchants who are playing -- paying the sales tax; it's the consumer. They're collecting it for you. So find a way to collect from them. Your scheme. But I'm not concerned about your scheme as such. I'm concerned about the many unanswered questions that overturning precedents will create a massive amount of lawsuits about. I know you've told us that Quill has created its own set of lawsuits, I guess every law does, but here there are some significant ones. You're not retroactive, but your adversaries point out that there are many states who have already made this collection retroactive. So we have that question. We have questions about what's the contact that you have to do to impose this obligation. Are we going to decide it under Complete Auto? Are we going to decide it under Pike balancing? How much contact is enough to justify placing this obligation on an out-of-town seller? So there's going to be a host of questions. What happens when the tax program breaks down, as it already has for the states who are using it, and merchants can't keep track of who they've sold to? All of these are questions that are wrought with difficulties. So you're introducing now a whole new set of difficulties to put be -- to put behind something that's been in place for 30 years now? How about economic? So how many sales does it take? You're at 200,000, I believe, or 200 sales, and I don't remember the monetary amount. But what's the minimum? I know what it was set at. It still doesn't answer the question. What's the minimum everywhere else? So what are we going to do with the costs that you're going to put on small businesses? Actually, they're put at disadvantage, not by Quill, but by the fact that there are massive discount sellers, not just on the Internet, but even in stores now. I -- I'm talking about the added cost of doing business for the small businessman, someone -- one of the briefs said it was a $250,000 cost to implement one of these sales programs, one of these sales tax programs? That doesn't include auditing. It doesn't include integrating the program with the existing sales program of the company. It doesn't account for the maintenance of the program. There's lots of costs that are inherent in a process of this type. I'm sorry. There's five states that don't centralize the state and local. That doesn't do anything -- that doesn't do anything for the interim period and for the dislocation and lawsuits that will -- it will engender until there is a congressional settlement. Can you imagine us saying anything -- assuming we were -- and it's hypothetical to accept your position. Is there anything we can do to give Congress a signal that it should act more affirmatively in this area? Well -- Is there any brief I can read or any source to determine what constitutes a small business in America? I don't even have the answer to that. Okay? The figures we were given was based on a small business. But is 200 sales a year the minimum, or is it something higher? That's the South Dakota law. It has a minimum amount of sales. I don't know. I don't know enough about the Internet to make a judgment, as suggested by the Solicitor General, to make a judgment that these are actually the right numbers. Is there something I could look at to figure it out? I -- I'm sorry, you said earlier one sale is enough for -- to justify a state imposing the reporting requirements. Are you backing off that? What does Pike give us that -- if you're saying one sale is enough? So why is it that the states are doing it? The other side pointed us to a number of states that are already making it retroactive.

2017,United States v. Sanchez-Gomez,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Reviewed to do what? I'm sorry, how do they -- Counsel, I -- I, frankly, have never heard of a class action that would interfere with the -- with a pending case, as this one appears it might be trying to do. Part of the claim here is that there's an automatic shackling and that district courts are not, pursuant to the -- to the statute, giving individualized consideration to whether people should be released or not. That second issue will not be susceptible to class treatment of any kind. So it's only a partial -- it's only a partial solution to this problem? How strange there -- Of the -- what are there, 99 districts in the country? How many of them have had a shackling policy similar to this one? Is it fair to say that that's a small percentage compared to the whole? And in -- in the whole, the individualized determinations are made? Counsel, going back to what the Ninth Circuit said in their majority opinion, they didn't deal with the mootness issue except through the class action argument. They do state in their opinion, however, the principle that was mentioned earlier, that we generally don't presume in their case law that someone will commit a criminal act. The government points to that -- -- in saying, absent the class action mechanism, you really can't get past that circuit case law -- -- if -- if -- it seems to me that shouldn't we let the Ninth Circuit figure that out? If we don't accept the class action mechanism they use -- it's a big but, it -- hypothetically, if we don't accept that, shouldn't we just remand and let them decide whether this is capable of repetition or not?

2017,Murphy v. Smith,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Your adversary points to a number of statutes that use the verb ""to satisfy"" -- or I guess not the verb, but the proposition ""to satisfy"" -- to refer to the complete fulfillment of an obligation. How do you distinguish those examples? Well -- Counsel, what do you think -- I know in your brief you seem to suggest that the purpose for giving district court judges discretion was to ensure that the district courts could balance the fault of the defendant -- defendant vis-a-vis the plaintiff, but I don't see anything in this statute that speaks to fault. I am more moved, and I don't know why -- or if you have disavowed it, that since the district court is intended in this judgment to compensate for injury, that it should be given some discretion to determine how much of that injury a plaintiff should actually be forced to bear -- -- when he or she was not at fault. Let's assume -- How would you write this if you wanted -- if you were Congress and wanted to get their -- -- version of the bill in one sentence? How would you have written it? No, I said in one sentence. The precursor bill was in two sentences. Was -- was the intent to reduce discretion, or I thought the intent was to deter non-meritorious lawsuits? Well, there are meritorious lawsuits on a scale -- -- of merit -- -- some that are serious, some that are not so serious, where there can be an award. So I can see Congress giving discretion based on the nature of the claim. That is more supportive of your position, which is -- Why? Where do you get that from? Where in the -- anywhere is that said, is that discussed, is that indicated in the -- in this section at all? Can I -- can I just ask you something about the statute? Let's assume the statute read, without the parenthetical, when it said a portion of the judgment shall be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney's fees awarded against the defendant. Would that mean 25 percent absent that 25 percent? Absent the parenthetical. No, it says a portion of the judgment. So it doesn't say all of the judgment. It -- it doesn't say the judgment shall be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney's fees. If all it said is ""a portion of the judgment shall be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney's fees against the defendant,"" do you think in that, standing alone, the district court would have discretion to give a dollar? It's a -- no? It's a portion of the judgment. Why? A portion is a portion. It's not all of it. It doesn't say all of the judgment; it says a portion. So why didn't Congress say a portion of the judgment, 25 percent, instead of not to exceed 25 percent? Why doesn't it just say a portion of the judgment, 25 percent, shall be applied to satisfy the amount? No, no. That's -- I'm asking you -- -- what's the difference between the two things? I'm sorry. Is your view -- let's assume, it's highly unlikely, but it can happen, the -- the attorney's fees are less than 25 percent of the judgment. Who pays under your reading of the statute as written? And the defendant pays nothing? All right. So what is the difference by Congress saying a portion of the judgment, not to exceed 25 percent -- why didn't it just say: a portion of the judgment (25 percent) shall be applied? Under your reading, the two mean exactly the same thing. Then you're doing away with the ""shall apply."" No one ever speaks of that ""shall apply"" as meaning that you give more than 25 percent. You don't award him attorney's fees of 25 percent of the judgment. I'm sorry, the non -- the non-incarcerated plaintiffs are under 1988. They get all of their fees. If they wanted to equalize them, they would have left them alone. But it didn't say civil tort plaintiffs. He said non-incarcerated plaintiffs. He didn't say tort plaintiffs. But that's not. It's up to 25 percent. They didn't say 25 percent. Twenty-five percent of what she cooks. (Laughter.) Can I ask about something else, which is we've made the American rule the presumption, but I come at it, why aren't we looking at the discretionary rule of 1988? In fee-shifting statutes that are clear -- and this is clear, they're shifting some fees -- we tend to give district courts maximum discretion. We don't look to tie their hands. Why do you think that given the fact that some plaintiffs are seriously injured by state defendants, that Congress would have wanted to take away from the district court absolute discretion to ensure that a plaintiff is adequately compensated for the severity of their injury? But that's exactly right. They don't get punitive awards under 1988. But that's the point, isn't it? Well, these plaintiffs cannot receive punitive damages against the state, correct? They did. And it was put down -- and it was reduced.

2018,Republic of Sudan v. Harrison,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"May I ask you the ""address and dispatch"" concept, much of the brief was centered around that being where the minister sits in the capital of the foreign state. But there are many countries where the minister -- the foreign minister doesn't necessarily sit in the capital. Or let's assume an emergency, something's happened at that minister's seat and he's now sitting -- -- in a nearby building -- -- or in another city within the state. Or even he's decided he's going to come and spend three months in the United States. It's one of these ministers who thinks he should visit all foreign countries -- -- for an extended period. Is ""address and dispatch"" to his home in the foreign state, to his normal place of business? What -- what -- what's -- how do we define it? If I'm writing this opinion -- -- because I don't actually think you mean to -- to say -- to add a phrase -- -- at the foreign state's ministry or something. What's his -- his or her official address, is that it? I -- As I understand it, 1608 is already a lower bar than what the United States itself asks for when it is sued or what other nations ask for when they're sued. So it's already different process than -- a lower process than what's normally acceptable. So what difference does it make that it's different than what you do now? I've done a little bit of research on the service of process rules in the 50 states, and in virtually every one of them, in some manner or form, it basically says serve the person or the entity where they live, where they're doing business. Now you would say this is doing business in the embassy. But since it's being addressed to the foreign minister, he is not physically there except for an occasional visit. It seems a natural understanding under most due process concerns that you serve the person where you're likely to find them. And that's not at most embassies, except in the rare visits which are very big state things, so I -- I -- I'm not sure that you can avoid reading ""addressed and dispatched"" as having some sense that this is a place where this person is regularly to be found, not merely where his entity has -- does some transactional business occasionally. But we can't ignore that it's not the place where the person usually is. And that concept, I think, is the essence of due process. Well, ""addressed and dispatched"" has a very sense of urgency. You're going to send it to the person and not to some far distant place from where that person may be on occasion. Isn't it -- isn't it strange to think that we have the Vienna Convention that protects the embassy from a service processor knocking on the door and hand-delivering something, but you can go in by mail and place a burden on the embassy by requiring either that it put it in its diplomatic pouch or hand-deliver it or do something else, do the mailing for you, to the foreign minister? Isn't that the exact kind of burden that the convention was intended to avoid? But those are all subject to the discretion of the district court. They're not rules of -- they're not absolute rules. What happens -- I -- I hate to use a country, but let's assume a country that's more than 24-hour mailing away, and they only have a pouch once a week, it gets to them, they send it back, it's now going to take whatever amount of time to come back, and the judge says no, waiting a month, waiting six weeks is just too much time. That doesn't respect the dignitary expectations of all other states, including this one, the United States, that -- -- that kind of serve -- No, no -- Are you asking us to -- are you suggesting that the U.N. embassy would be a place to effect service under this provision?

2018,United States v. Stitt,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I have little problem understanding your argument with respect to mobile homes or floating homes. Those are structures that don't have any propulsion -- self-propulsion mechanisms. If I drive by a mobile home, it's a home on land. I don't think of it as a vehicle in any meaningful way. A floating home is essentially the same. It just floats, but, to move it, you need a vehicle to move it of some sort, a ship. But RVs, campers, tents, these temporary things, how is some -- someone supposed to know that people are using them to sleep in at a particular moment? All right. But how about the -- just a car? There are plenty of homeless people, I know, in both New York and Washington, because I've seen them, sleep in their cars, but, if I'm a thief and I see a blanket or a pillow in the back of the car, I have no idea, there's no notice that it's being used to sleep in because -- or to sleep in overnight. You know, parents who take a kid on a trip will throw a pillow and a blanket in the back. I've thrown one in the back if someone else is driving during the day. So what are we supposed to do about the ""used"" part of this? ""Adapted"" I understand. You might be able to see that. But how would you, if you're a thief, know that a car is being used for someone to sleep in overnight? So where any person lives. The homeless person who lives in a car. So define ""used"" for me. How is -- And define it in a way that a thief is going to know or a burglar is going to know that it's being used as a home. You've gone around my question. Would someone who breaks into a car that a homeless person is using as their home -- are they encompassed by your definition or by these statutes? I'm -- I'm sorry. What is ""assume""? And then what's the meaning of ""adapted""? Is it a structural change of some sort, or is it throwing a pillow and blanket? Is it putting a mattress in there? What -- what does ""adapted"" mean? And what's customary to understand that adaptation? But we can't just leave it in state hands. We're providing a federal definition. So what's the federal definition that we give? Well, we said dwelling and structure. So now -- building and structure. Pardon me. Now we have to define ""structure."" Or give some understanding of what the federal meaning of it was. In our cases, we very clearly excluded vehicles. We said that. And so now you want us to put a gloss on that. And I want to know how and what guidance we give on that gloss. So does it have to be something permanent to be adapted? Well, the problem really is that, if it's criminal law, shouldn't we be clear? Shouldn't we give notice to people of what the consequences of their actions are, and so don't we have an obligation to be as clear as we can be? Just a bed, putting a mattress?

2018,"Knick v. Township of Scott, Pennsylvania",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I'm sorry. Isn't that what condemnation, whether it's regular or inverse, does? The first question the court answers is, is there a taking? So it does reach the constitutional question. Even in a -- in a regular condemnation -- condemnation proceeding, they have to decide whether it -- the government has a public interest or not. That's what makes it constitutional. So I don't understand. Can I ask another question, however? Assuming that you were right and that you had a federal cause of action or should have one under 1983, when this case goes to a federal court, why would a district court be -- abuse its discretion for abstaining under any of the three doctrines, Pullman, Louisiana Power & Light, or Colorado River? All of them say that district courts can abstain when a legal issue involves state law and that state law could obviate the federal proceeding. So one of two things can happen in the state court below. They say no taking, and then there's no taking; or, second, there's a taking, and the inverse condemnation proceeding will provide the remedy. So, in many ways, this obviates the proceeding altogether. Why isn't -- -- why isn't that the case here? The whole issue is whether this graveyard law is a -- was inherent in the property she took, meaning that's what I understood the legal question was. It's all about the state law rights of landowners vis-a-vis cemeteries. I guess my bottom-line question is, if the abstention doctrines apply, which I think they would -- you've given me no reason why they shouldn't -- aren't you just inviting now a patchwork of federal and state involvement in cases? Williamson has at least the advantage of clarifying where people go and how these claims are adjudicated. If we have abstention playing in, you're going to have a patchwork of some state inverse condemnation proceedings, some not, some courts taking cases, others rightfully talking about abstention. Well, why are you claiming that the state courts in an inverse condemnation proceeding are inadequate? How about the town -- Would that mean that if the state or the locality says once we have an administrative law, if you disagree with it, you have to go through this administrative process and, if we violated something, we'll pay for it? Would that be okay? So -- but wait a minute. What you're saying is a state passes a law, it says at the bottom of the law we don't think this is a condemnation, but, if it is, follow this administrative process. So it's basically saying we'll pay you if you're right. You're saying they don't have to exhaust that administrative process even? No, no. I'm saying they pass an administrative law that puts -- that recognizes some sort of easement, whether it's historical or not I'm not going to get into. There's a dispute as to whether it -- you took title to that property with that easement or not. Do you say that if the state or the city or whatever says you have to follow this administrative process to determine whether this law is right or not, that you don't have to exhaust that administrative process? So there's no hope for states. They're going to be in federal court all of the time on every administrative law that they pass? Was it raised by the parties? I'm sorry, the courthouse doors are closed to people on tax issues, even though there's constitutional claims. So there's a class that we have both for -- for doctrinal reasons and -- and comity issues and a lot of other reasons, we've closed the courthouse doors. We've closed them to people claiming that they had an unreasonable search and seizure. If they litigated in state court under the Fourth Amendment, a claim in state court, they can't come to federal court afterwards. So it's not as if our courthouse doors are open uniformly to everybody anytime. There -- there are all sorts of doctrines that preclude people -- -- from coming to federal court once they've been issue-precluded in state court. Well, except Williamson, which basically says there's no taking. And you don't -- you're not encouraging us to believe that compensation is due the minute there's a taking, is it? That it has to be -- happen before the taking? I'm sorry. You -- you can remove a state -- a state reverse condemnation case if there's diversity. To have a due process right claim under 1983 -- -- you have to have a valid claim that the process that you're being offered by the state is inadequate, unfair. There's a bunch of different words. So that if compensation is unfair, inadequate, et cetera, you could still have a federal claim under 1983? And if you have a -- if you're claiming that you haven't had a fair process, you can still go -- even after you finish the process, you can still go to federal court and you won't be claim-precluded if you prove that the process you received wasn't fair, correct? So to say that you have a right -- Now I have -- -- I have -- may I? And I know there's some dispute below, but have you taken a look at sovereign immunity? Can states be sued for reverse condemnation in federal court unless they've agreed to be sued in federal court? The township could, but -- Sorry. I -- the only right at issue here that you're claiming is the right to have this adjudicated in federal court. You haven't suggested that the Pennsylvania inverse condemnation system is unfair, unjust, not reasonable, not fast, not anything else, right? So your only absolute claim is ""I should have had this done in federal court, not state court,"" correct? Because I wanted it in federal court? Well, she's not -- -- guaranteed that, unfortunately, because even under the abstention doctrines, the issue of whether or not there was a permanent easement on her property the day she bought it, because this has been historically true for 300 years, I don't know. I don't know how the district court's going to do that without referring to state law. And so that's what she wishes for. ",I be sorry be not that what condemnation whether it be regular or inverse do the first question the court answer be be there a taking so it do reach the constitutional question even in a in a regular condemnation condemnation proceeding they have to decide whether it the government have a public interest or not that be what make it constitutional so i do not understand can i ask another

2018,Culbertson v. Berryhill,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I do have a question about that. I'm troubled by the idea of attorneys attempting to collect fees directly from their clients. Now I understand from the briefing that you can't garnish disability benefits, so if you don't get paid your percentage, you can't garnish disability benefits. But how can you collect otherwise? You don't collect over the fund that Justice Ginsburg is describing. The retained amount. Don't you think that Congress wouldn't have wanted Social Security recipients to be hounded by collection efforts? I understood here there was some EAJA money that you could have received. But I'm talking about the extreme possibility -- -- where there's a small EAJA award, but you get 50 percent of the recovery. Are we going to have people garnishing something or attaching something that belongs to clients? I'm not asking about most cases. I'm asking about exceptions. When -- I have a question that bothers me greatly about this whole litigation. It seems like your interests are contrary to your client's interests, meaning your client under no circumstance should want the danger of paying more than the 25 percent aggregate. So shouldn't you have gotten a different lawyer for her in some point in this litigation earlier than here? That's not true consent. At least when I was a district court judge, you had to not only advise her but advise her of the potential conflict and advise her to seek separate counsel. Was that done? I -- I am troubled by these fee disputes because I want -- often wonder if clients are being adequately represented once the dispute moves from the main case and into how much you're entitled to. Not without being told of the potential conflict. How many cases have EAJA awards? So in about 40 to 50 percent of the cases there will always be a pot bigger than the 25 percent? That's what you're fighting for, is that 25 percent that -- that -- Does. Counsel, how often are those people family members or -- or -- All right. You say there's no danger or little danger of garnishment of future benefits. But you also say that sometimes the government permits garnishing to help attorneys satisfy awards under 25 percent when they have missed out on withholding. Where do you get that authority from, to permit garnishing or to permit garnishing above the 25 percent? I can understand if -- Right. To the -- to the poor recipient, it doesn't really sound like they were responsible for your failure to withhold. I'm not sure what gives you the authority. Basically, you're garnishing their benefits. Well, I think maybe we should just be practical, okay? Let's assume that there's 25 percent of the judgment that wasn't paid out. What do you think the lawyer can do to get that 25 percent? He can't go after the future benefits, correct? So let's -- let's stop there. So you're saying, yes, he could potentially go after the pot of past-due benefits up to the excess that he wants, is that -- I -- I -- I think that may be wrong on your part because the agency is only authorized to withhold 25 percent. So I don't think you can claim that they wrongfully didn't withhold an additional 25 percent. So I don't think -- But that's legislatively imposed. I -- I -- I take your point that there could be garnishment on the past-due amounts, is what you're saying. I'm presuming also that that attorney could withhold documents from the client, could do anything else a lawyer does when they're not paid, correct? There's -- there's such representation before the court -- -- in (b), and before -- in (a), before the commissioner? Ms. Weil, I believe it helps you, doesn't it, that the probability of there being an award over 25 percent of the past-due amounts is when no past-due amounts are awarded, correct? Because an attorney can receive a reasonable fee. Exactly. And so in those -- in those cases, it's always going to be 25 percent -- more than 25 percent. Exactly. Are there any other situations in which the 25 percent -- over 25 percent could be, in fact, calculated? Because the government's making much of this, that Congress contemplated it, and I thought your brief said they contemplated it only in the two circumstances of where there's no past-due amounts. ",i do have a question about that I be trouble by the idea of attorney attempt to collect fee directly from their client now i understand from the briefing that you can not garnish disability benefit so if you do not get pay your percentage you can not garnish disability benefit but how can you collect otherwise you do not collect over the fund that justice ginsburg be describe the retained amount do not you think that congress would not have want social security recipient to be hound by collection effort i understood here there be some eaja money that you could have receive but I be talk about the extreme possibility where there be a small eaja award but you get percent of the recovery be we go to have people garnish something or attach something that belong to client I be not ask about most case I be ask about exception when i have a question that bother me greatly about this whole litigation it seem like your interest be contrary to your client s interest mean your client under no circumstance should want the danger of pay more than the percent aggregate so should not you have get a different lawyer for her in some point in this litigation earlier than here that be not true consent at least when i be a district court judge you have to not only advise her but advise her of the potential conflict and advise her to seek separate counsel be that do i i be trouble by these fee dispute because i want often wonder if client be be adequately represent once the dispute move from the main case and into how much you be entitle to not without be tell of the potential conflict how many case have eaja award so in about to percent of the case there will always be a pot big than the percent that be what you be fight for be that percent that that do counsel how often be those people family member or or all right you say there be no danger or little danger of garnishment of future benefit but you also say that sometimes the government permit garnish to help attorney satisfy award under percent when they have miss out on withholding where do you get that authority from to permit garnish or to permit garnish above the percent i can understand if right to the to the poor recipient it do not really sound like they we be responsible for your failure to withhold I be not sure what give you the authority basically you be garnish their benefit well i think maybe we should just be practical okay let us assume that there be percent of the judgment that be not pay out what do you think the lawyer can do to get that percent he can not go after the future benefit correct so let us let us stop there so you be say yes he could potentially go after the pot of past due benefit up to the excess that he want be that i i i think that may be wrong on your part because the agency be only authorize to withhold percent so i do not think you can claim that they wrongfully do not withhold an additional percent so i do not think but that be legislatively impose i i i take your point that there could be garnishment on the past due amount be what you be say I be presume also that that attorney could withhold document from the client could do anything else a lawyer do when they be not pay correct there be there be such representation before the court in b and before in a before the commissioner ms weil i believe it help you do not it that the probability of there be an award over percent of the past due amount be when no past due amount be award correct because an attorney can receive a reasonable fee exactly and so in those in those case it be always go to be percent more than percent exactly be there any other situation in which the percent over percent could be in fact calculate because the government s make much of this that congress contemplate it and i think your brief say they contemplate it only in the two circumstance of where there be no past due amount ,317.5200000000001,Roberts Court,"Nov 7, 2018",Richard Allen Culbertson,"Nancy A.

2018,Azar v. Allina Health Services,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I have a -- a sort of problem with this. And I know you say that, but I don't know how you take this outside of being a policy, meaning it's applying to every single provider uniformly. I don't know the basis that you could have a individual adjudication. And what would happen? The board would look at it and say we're not going to listen, even though we're required to listen, to the agency's position; we're going to tell them they're wrong? If one case tells you the agency is wrong, does that case then become the new policy? Or -- or are you -- I'm a little lost as to how this is not a agency policy. A statement of policy. Well, that's what I'm -- that's what I'm having a problem with. It's every single provider is going to be given a fraction that incorporates your policy, and that binds what they're going to get. Because they have to use that fraction in the claims they made against you. From you -- from the contractor, from the agency, they're only going to get the fraction as you told the contractor to calculate it. I -- I just don't understand what difference it means -- it means -- I mean, even a regulation or a rule may have legal meaning only until it's accepted, but even a rule can be challenged later on appeal. The grounds for that challenge might be different, but I can go into court and say it's ultra vires. I can go into court and say it's not supported by the statute. It's not binding in -- in any meaningful way, other than that's what the agency's going to do. Well, the problem I have is that the provision adds something. It's not just rule or regulation; it's statement of policy. And it seems to suggest to me that there's some interpretive rules that are encompassed by that. Now which ones is the open question. But it does seem to suggest that it's broader than the APA ever was, because the APA only talks about rules. Mr. Kneedler, why didn't -- -- why didn't Congress just say this is like the APA? Why does it change the language at all? I have to give some meaning different than the APA to Congress's express choice of a different articulation of the standard. Well, the problem I have with that -- -- counsel -- -- but -- but let me -- let me stop you. If that's what Congress intended, it could have stopped in 1986 because, in 1986, it had done what you said. But something -- and you read the House report -- -- the House bill -- was leading them to believe that a different standard was necessary because they changed it. They had the APA standard in 1986. They chose intentionally to alter it by altering it in '87. And you look at the rejection of the House bill as something that helps you, but I'm not sure how. Because it tells me they are significantly concerned about things that make major changes, substantive changes in how people are being paid. This one does. But when is ever a statement of policy binding? Meaning, when is a statement -- if it's not a rule or regulation, if it's just a statement of policy, when is it ever binding as you've defined ""binding""? Isn't policy something that can be challenged? But I look at the subsequent history of this in -- in the D.C. Circuit, and I look at Clarian Health West, and your fears there are overstated. A fairly significant change was held not to be encompassed by this provision because it really was just following the statute. This is filling a gap in the statute. I don't know what else is clearly more a policy than that when you're filling in a gap as opposed to interpreting a statute. And that seems to be the distinction the D.C. -- D.C. Circuit is applying. That's my point. That's my point. Which is not everything is going to come under this. Could you give meaning to legal, substantive legal? Because that -- that's where the strongest argument, I think your adversary makes, which is generally we think of legal as binding. So, if you can deal with that, I think -- -- everything else you're saying falls into place. Do you have any idea -- Do you have any idea why this change wasn't put through the ordinary rulemaking notice and -- I've now forgotten. Why was that rebuffed? I remember the 2013. But I don't remember the -- Can you point to anything in the history of the '86 bill or '87 bill that leads substance to your claim that Congress was not, in fact, concerned about substantive changes in formulas like this one being done through rulemaking as opposed to adjudication? I thought in all the history I read that was motivating them is the agency's change of policy of doing less than a rulemaking. They wanted more or the same but not less.

This definition of ""on sale,"" to be frank with you, I've looked at the history cited in the briefs, I looked at the cases, I don't find it anywhere.

",if you ask a consumer but if you ask in the industry to distributor they will say the moment that apple be go to start ship it to distributor that i do not win be irrelevant to me it be on sale the moment distributor we be go to pick it up and ship it out this definition of on sale to be frank with you I have look at the history cite in the brief i look at the case i do not find it anywhere you be sort of give on sale to the public its meaning but those be not the word use by congress congress could have say on sale to the public and then we might have to grapple with this congress just say on sale do not that defeat your argument if that phrase have an independent meaning and you have just give it two then why do not we take the word congress use with their history because they do not say on sale to the public they just say on sale and when you have a historical term that have a history as a matter of course we look at that history mr jay you we be cut off before you give an example i be not quite move by your baseball example so do you have something else in something that be base in law where otherwise be use in the way you suggest and the second part of my question be will we be the only country that have a first to file system that include private sale confidential wise I be sorry explain that to me an on sale no there be no on sale bar public or private ,107.11999999999998,Roberts Court,"Dec 4, 2018",Helsinn Healthcare S.A.,"Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., et al.",17-1229,"Jun 25, 2018","Jan 22, 2019",113.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2018,Garza v. Idaho,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Whose choice is that? I think you're -- you're going a little too fast -- -- because I'm breaking that down. All right? A defendant comes to you, you're a competent attorney, and says I want to appeal. What does a defense attorney generally do first? He consults, correct? He tells the client: You -- this is what the law says. You have a waiver in here. You shouldn't appeal. You run the risk of breaching the agreement, and the government could go back and rescind the agreement and put you into jail for a lot longer. Do you really want to do this? Now the client -- isn't the client the one who has the right to appeal? Isn't that what we've said for dozens of cases? The attorney can decide what to appeal. And so, if the client tells you appeal, you put in your notice of appeal. And if you don't think there's a viable issue, you file an Anders brief and you tell the court there isn't. The defendant then has -- is invited to tell the court what it thinks, right? And then the court makes the decision, correct? With the client deciding whether he wants to rescind the plea agreement? Nothing prohibits a defendant from rescinding a contract, correct? You suffer consequences -- Mr. Ali -- Mr. Ali, what do you do with the jurisdictions that permit a defense attorney to tell a client: I don't see there's a meritorious issue, but I'm going to give you the instructions on how to file your own notice of appeal? There are other jurisdictions -- I think the majority -- who require the attorney to file the notice of appeal and then an Anders brief. But what do we do with those that say: When you're instructed by your client to file a notice of appeal and you can't do it because it's an ethical obligation -- an ethical violation, you tell the client how to do it. Is that enough for you? Yeah, the error here was the attorney did nothing and ignored -- claims to have done nothing -- -- and ignored -- -- repeated inquiries about the appeal. Mr. -- Are you -- I'm sorry. Are -- are -- just to go through this, are you aware of whether the federal system or state system would deny a defendant another attorney if, under Flores-Ortega, it's found that an attorney was directed to file an appeal, didn't do it; hence, he was ineffective under Flores-Ortega? When the defendant went back down, would he or would he not get another attorney? I -- I'm just asking because I'm not aware, at least from my old circuit -- -- that we would have not appointed a new attorney once one has been found ineffective. Now that new attorney could file an Anders brief, could do anything permissible under the rules. But my point is I don't know enough about the other jurisdictions. I'd be sorely surprised that most wouldn't. Would you have -- could you address Flores-Ortega? Because the way it approached the issue was pretty clear. It said, in deciding whether counsel is ineffective, first you determine whether a defendant would have appealed. And it said there's two ways to make that determination. A, was there a plea waiver? If yes, then he wouldn't have appealed. Or, second, did he tell the attorney he wanted to appeal? And this is the second of those. But I can't square your position with Flores-Ortega because Flores-Ortega seemed to accept as a working proposition that given that there is even, in a guilty plea, there are waivers of some issues but not others, that the question of whether a defendant would have appealed takes into account the plea waiver at that stage, but once a defendant tells an attorney to appeal, that's his choice. I don't know how to get around Ortega, Flores-Ortega. I don't know what's both here. This is the second part of Flores-Ortega. The attorney -- no, the first part says there's a plea waiver. If the defendant doesn't ask you for one, you don't have to consult. But, once he asks you for one, you have to file a notice of appeal. This is just the second situation. How about totally not understand the system? You don't think that a defendant who has a right to appeal has a right, I mean, to even an Anders brief? Because that tells you why you can't appeal. In -- in my experience, again -- and I don't know if it's typical or not -- Anders briefs are filed and most defendants don't respond, but occasionally you get a few who do. If you forfeited that right to have someone explain to you the whys, you can't get it back. Under your -- under your position that you're not -- you've forfeited your right to appeal altogether. I don't -- -- I don't understand. It's a ruling on the merits. You have no case. Both of them are you have no case. How you -- I don't understand there being a difference between what -- I don't know if it was you or the government who suggested threshold -- threshold and merit issues. It's a decision on the appeal. A motion to dismiss is on the merits. Counsel, I'm looking at page 5 of the brief, the blue brief, and so you didn't write it, but it says that, ""Mr. Garza promptly filed a pro se petition for post-conviction relief. In it, he asserted that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by disregarding his instruction to file a notice of appeal. Mr. Garza further argued that he did not knowingly and voluntarily plead guilty and that he had entered an involuntary plea."" So let's -- May I assume the following: that that's what he wanted to appeal, but his attorney, by never conferring with him, didn't get that information? Your answer would be if the attorney wasn't told that by his client because the attorney never asked his client, that that's not ineffective assistance of counsel in this situation where the attorney asked him to file a notice of appeal? I'm sorry. Those circuits don't believe in Anders briefs? No, no, no, no, I -- it does. I mean -- So, if an attorney has filed a notice of appeal and -- and doesn't file an Anders brief, it means that he or she believes they have some viable -- potentially viable argument, right? So the fact that the court requires briefing on that, why is that an additional burden? ",whose choice be that i think you be you be go a little too fast because I be break that down all right a defendant come to you you be a competent attorney and say i want to appeal what do a defense attorney generally do first he consult correct he tell the client you this be what the law say you have a waiver in here you should not appeal you run the risk of breach the agreement and the government could go back and rescind the agreement and put you into jail for a lot long do you really want to do this now the client be not the client the one who have the right to appeal be not that what we have say for dozen of case the attorney can decide what to appeal and so if the client tell you appeal you put in your notice of appeal and if you do not think there be a viable issue you file an anders brief and you tell the court there be not the defendant then have be invite to tell the court what it think right and then the court make the decision correct with the client decide whether he want to rescind the plea agreement nothing prohibit a defendant from rescind a contract correct you suffer consequence mr ali mr ali what do you do with the jurisdiction that permit a defense attorney to tell a client i do not see there be a meritorious issue but I be go to give you the instruction on how to file your own notice of appeal there be other jurisdiction i think the majority who require the attorney to file the notice of appeal and then an anders brief but what do we do with those that say when you be instruct by your client to file a notice of appeal and you can not do it because it be an ethical obligation an ethical violation you tell the client how to do it be that enough for you yeah the error here be the attorney do nothing and ignore claim to have do nothing

not have to consult but once he ask you for one you have to file a notice of appeal this be just the second situation how about totally not understand the system you do not think that a defendant who have a right to appeal have a right i mean to even an anders brief because that tell you why you can not appeal in in my experience again and i do not know if it be typical or not anders brief be file and most defendant do not respond but occasionally you get a few who do if you forfeit that right to have someone explain to you the why be you can not get it back under your under your position that you be not you have forfeit your right to appeal altogether i do not i do not understand it be a ruling on the merit you have no case both of them be you have no case how you i do not understand there be a difference between what i do not know if it be you or the government who suggest threshold threshold and merit issue it be a decision on the appeal a motion to dismiss be on the merit counsel I be look at page of the brief the blue brief and so you do not write it but it say that mr garza promptly file a pro se petition for post conviction relief in it he assert that his trial counsel render ineffective assistance by disregard his instruction to file a notice of appeal mr garza far argue that he do not knowingly and voluntarily plead guilty and that he have enter an involuntary plea so let us may i assume the following that that be what he want to appeal but his attorney by never confer with him do not get that information your answer would be if the attorney be not tell that by his client because the attorney never ask his client that that be not ineffective assistance of counsel in this situation where the attorney ask him to file a notice of appeal I be sorry those circuit do not believe in anders brief no no no no i it do i mean so if an attorney have file a notice of appeal and and do not file an anders brief it mean that he or she believe they have some viable

2018,"Return Mail, Inc. v. United States Postal Service",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"What if -- would the government or the Postal Service be able to initiate ex parte reexamination? Because, under your theory, ""person"" doesn't include the Postal Service. How do you punish them if they send a letter saying there was this prior art, do you want to look at this? But someone is not -- according to you, a person is not the government. So where do the -- where does the government get its permission? In the form -- the government in the form of the Postal Service, where does it get the permission to initiate that process? So, if the Act permits the government to sue for infringement -- to be sued for infringement, which it does, what do you think it means to take away a defense? Meaning this is a defense tool for infringers. Does it make logical sense to deprive the government of the tool of being able to invoke this proceeding? But one thing you haven't said is, why not simply say the government can't? Meaning, if you're going to be consistent, then why do you need to give a different reading to ""person"" in the ex parte examination context? I'm not quite sure why you're doing that, but -- -- perhaps in answering -- because -- Except this is a very different situation. The Cato Institute in their amici brief suggests that in a situation in which the government is basically two branches of the government or two agencies of the government are disputing one another or -- or before one another, that that's a special situation that requires a closer look and a more express statement. It does seem like the deck is stacked against a private citizen who is dragged into these proceedings. They've got an executive agency acting as judge with an executive director who can pick the judges, who can substitute judges, can reexamine what those judges say, and change the ruling, and you've got another government agency being the prosecutor at the same time. In those situations, shouldn't you have a clear and express rule? Could you tell me why is that? Well, doesn't that counsel in favor of the presumption? Shouldn't we make the government think about this issue? It could very easily decide that we were wrong, if we were to decide in your adversary's favor, it's a hypothetical, but it would then be in a position to decide what kind of estoppel should be applicable or not in the Court of Federal Claims, but if it hasn't, assuming Justice Alito's process, wouldn't we be trumping the assumption by making a policy judgment to include the government because it makes sense to some of us? But there is a purported good reason here. There's a different estoppel that applies to the government. And that might be okay with Congress, but we're not sure of that.

2018,Madison v. Alabama,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Stevenson, part of the problem is the use of the word ""loss of memory."" And I -- in your briefs, you seem to go back and forth on this. Are you conceding that amnesia about the incident alone, where you can function in every other way in society, would you be incompetent then? To be executed? So your loss of memory isn't even what the cause of the loss of memory is. If this person who has amnesia can no longer function because they can't even remember how to eat or how to go to the bathroom or how to think about a problem or et cetera, you would say the cause is not what's important; it's whether their cognitive deficiencies cause what? Now fill in the blank. Mr. Stevenson, that's the point. Now let's -- -- let's take as given for the moment that the other side has conceded that severe dementia does qualify under Ford and Panetti. And I do -- I'm going to ask the other side where the Court addressed that issue, because I don't see it. They seem to be thinking that only delusions could qualify, not incompetence. But putting that aside for the moment, how would I define severe dementia? What's the difference between mild dementia, moderate, and severe? And where would the fact-finder settle in saying this person is incompetent or not incompetent? It's very -- it's very easy -- it's very hard to be a lay person, but I understand that won't show up for Alzheimer's, for example. Until someone's died and they can open up the brain. I'm -- I'm less worried about that because I am worried about something like Alzheimer's. Dementia's dementia. So let's get to the definition. Mr. Stevenson -- Mr. Stevenson, the court below believed that Dr. Kirkland and Goff's evaluations were essentially similar. Do you agree with that assessment? If you don't, tell me how you relate that lack of similarity to the question of his reliability. And what do you think the trial court should have done -- -- in order to deal with that? Can I go back to -- can I start there? It seems to me as I'm reading through some of the materials that you pointed to in your brief that, under the common law, there were different kinds of -- of defenses to murder, including lunacy. I see one of your sources, Cowell, and the other Hale, talking about lunacy being a condition unlike insanity, which they defined as never being in touch with reality. They define lunacy as being able to remember some things but not others. And yet, to a source, the common law excused lunatics, so that if states are folding in dementia into lunacy, into insanity, into other sort of broader labels just like the common law did, how can I rely on your statement that there's no consensus? I don't even know that we have to get there because your adversary has said that he thinks this folds into Ford and Panetti because it's not dementia qua dementia; it's a certain kind of dementia that doesn't put you in rational touch with your decision-making in your moment. But, putting that aside, I -- I'm taking on your starting proposition. No, they define ""lunacy"" as someone who can remember sometimes and not remember -- have his wits sometime and not have his wits other times. Well, if you don't think a demented person who today doesn't remember you as your son, who doesn't know where he or she is, who doesn't know to call -- to go to the bathroom in the pot right next to him -- you don't call that being out of your wits? It could be that maybe tomorrow they might for a few minutes remember, but at the moment that they're having that episode, are they within their wits? I guess -- I'm sorry -- -- how about -- All right. In Panetti, the man understood that the -- that he was in jail, that the state was charging him with a crime, that it was going to put him to death. He believed they wouldn't, because of his delusions, ultimately succeed, but he understood perfectly well that set of facts. And we said that still qualified him. So we have a man here who knows that he's incarcerated or kept in a cage because he's in a bed, he can't move on his own, can't remember where the bathroom is next to him, can't see, slurs his words. He's really not quite there. But he knows that someone says he committed a murder and that they're trying to kill him, but he doesn't understand why. He can't be present enough in time to rationally understand or reflect on what he has done because he can't retain information for long. And why is that different than Panetti? In Panetti, the man was blaming someone else, which may be even worse for some people, or saying that someone else is going to protect him. But if you can't rationally appreciate why you're putting -- being put to death, how does that fulfill the Panetti standard? So what if he can't understand or really follow through in his thinking what that means? I mean, he's just not rational in the way you and I understand it. I certainly don't think a demented person who has Alzheimer's and is put in a -- in an institution might have a moment of understanding one memory, and I think that they are rational. I certainly don't think you would let them buy an apartment in Florida the way he told one of his lawyers he was going to do after this case ended. But you don't disagree that Ford and Panetti, read properly, would not be limited to insanity, delusion, or severe dementia? And -- Well, that's -- -- interesting to me because I don't read anywhere in Kirkland where he did any analysis of rationality. What he did, as I understood it, is just does he remember his crime or something -- he doesn't remember his crime, but does he understand where he is and what they're going to do to him? That's not the same as rational understanding. He did no memory test to see how long Mr. Madison retained information generally. He did not describe the extent of his dementia. He didn't do any of the things one would expect if he was going to opine on rationality. So how -- the only one who did that was Dr. Goff, and that part of his discussion was not addressed by the Court below at all. ",mr stevenson part of the problem be the use of the word loss of memory and i in your brief you seem to go back and forth on this be you concede that amnesia about the incident alone where you can function in every other way in society would you be incompetent then to be execute so your loss of memory be not even what the because of the loss of memory be if this person who have amnesia can no longer function because they can not even remember how to eat or how to go to the bathroom or how to think about a problem or et cetera you would say the because be not what be important it be whether their cognitive deficiency because what now fill in the blank mr stevenson that be the point now let us let us take as give for the moment that the other side have concede that severe dementia do qualify under ford and panetti and i do I be go to ask the other side where the court address that issue because i do not see it they seem to be think that only delusion could qualify not incompetence

2018,Obduskey v. McCarthy & Holthus LLP,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Excuse me, I -- I've been having a huge problem with this entire case, not on your position, but I was going to ask this of your adversary. I'm reading the language of the statute. It says, for the purposes of Section 1692f, it includes people who are enforcing. And the statement that 1692f starts with is ""a debt collector, period, may not use the unfair or unconscionable means to collect or attempt to collect any debt."" It seems to say that a security person is a debt collector. And it says, ""without limiting the general applicability of the foregoing, without limiting that people who enforce debts, security interests, the following conduct in addition is a violation of this section"". I don't mean to help you, but I -- (Laughter.) -- but I'm reading f and it seems clearly to support your position. It's basically saying these are two additional bad ways that they can violate being a debt collector. It's not limiting it to those two ways. I don't even know what the repo argument was about in your brief. It's adding -- it's also including -- if there was ever any doubt, it's also including those people. But the one subsection seems to say any of these people can't do unfair practices. That -- that -- -- that's fine, but what -- what's really -- what's really at issue is the unfair practices. These people who enforce security interests cannot collect or attempt to collect any debt unfairly. That's the first sentence. And without limiting that general sentence, these two additional things are considered unfair practices. I -- I -- I -- so tell me the counter. Why -- why are they arguing that other unfair practices are not actionable when that sentence says it is to my mind? What am I missing there? I'm sorry. You -- you started that statement with when you send a letter to a state official. The issue here is not sending a letter to the state official. The issue here is, did you do something wrong in sending it to the customer first? Or to the creditor -- to the -- It is a bit strange to think that Congress intended to cover judicial foreclosures where a judge is supervising the process but not when it's a non-judge supervised process. It's -- it's counterintuitive, where more -- -- more damage, I think, can be done in a non-judicial foreclosure because there is no judge there to protect or review what's occurring. It -- I -- I'm not sure. You seem to argue that because Congress knew that non-judicial foreclosures were set forth in very particular ways. But they also knew judicial foreclosures are. Well, that -- that's the problem with non-judicial foreclosure. There's no way to ignore that you take the property to sell it to pay off a part or the whole of the debt. So do foreclosure actions. It doesn't help you review after sales if you've lost your home. I'm sorry, he -- he doesn't, because he says the creditor doesn't care -- the repo man doesn't care about the debt. He gets paid for taking the car. And if the creditor gets the car, the creditor exempted -- is exempted from the Act because he can -- he's legally entitled for his debt not covered by the Act to sell it. And so I'm not sure how you're right. The repo man is not looking for the guy to sell. And I think even Mr. Shanmugam said that if the repo guy said I will wait to three hours, if you pay your debt, I won't take your car, that he could, in fact, be a debt collector. I'm assuming that to the extent judicial foreclosures have been viewed as debt collection, that whatever conflicts have worked out there have also been -- that have happened there have also been worked out? ",excuse me i I have be have a huge problem with this entire case not on your position but i be go to ask this of your adversary I be read the language of the statute it say for the purpose of section f it include people who be enforce and the statement that f start with be a debt collector period may not use the unfair or unconscionable mean to collect or attempt to collect any debt it seem to say that a security person be a debt collector and it say without limit the general applicability of the foregoing without limit that people who enforce debt security interest the following conduct in addition be a violation of this section i do not mean to help you but i laughter but I be read f and it seem clearly to support your position it be basically say these be two additional bad way that they can violate be a debt collector it be not limit it to those two way i do not even know what the repo argument be about in your brief it be add it have also include if there be ever any doubt it be also include those people but the one subsection seem to say any of these people can not do unfair practice that that that be fine but what what be really what be really at issue be the unfair practice these people who enforce security interest can not collect or attempt to collect any debt unfairly that be the first sentence and without limit that general sentence these two additional thing be consider unfair practice i i i so tell me the counter why why be they argue that other unfair practice be not actionable when that sentence say it be to my mind what be i miss there I be sorry you you start that statement with when you send a letter to a state official the issue here be not send a letter to the state official the issue here be do you do something wrong in send it to the customer first or to the creditor to the it be a bit strange to think that congress intend to cover judicial foreclosure where a judge be supervise the process but not when it be a non judge supervise process it be it be counterintuitive where more more damage i think can be do in a non judicial foreclosure because there be no judge there to protect or review what be occur it i I be not sure you seem to argue that because congress know that non judicial foreclosure we be set forth in very particular way but they also know judicial foreclosure be well that that be the problem with non judicial foreclosure there be no way to ignore that you take the property to sell it to pay off a part or the whole of the debt so do foreclosure action it do not help you review after sale if you have lose your home I be sorry he he do not because he say the creditor do not care the repo man do not care about the debt he get pay for take the car and if the creditor get the car the creditor exempt be exempt from the act because he can he be legally entitle for his debt not cover by the act to sell it and so I be not sure how you be right the repo man be not look for the guy to sell and i think even mr shanmugam say that if the repo guy say i will wait to three hour if you pay your debt i will not take your car that he could in fact be a debt collector I be assume that to the extent judicial foreclosure have be view as debt collection that whatever conflict have work out there have also be that have happen there have also be work out ,276.2,Case pending,"Jan 7, 2019",Dennis Obduskey,"McCarthy & Holthus LLP, et al.",17-1307,"Jun 28, 2018",,113.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1

If you're now an additional defendant to the action, why do you -- why don't you need Jackson's approval to remove? And he's not approving because he's opposing you. But that's not true. All defendants don't have a shot at removal. Only if everybody agrees, in an original action, all defendants have to agree to removal, correct? So not every defendant individually has a right to removal. My point still remains that the statute by its own form doesn't guarantee the power to every defendant to remove. Well, how about in a -- how about -- If your theory is this right of removal, how about an involuntary plaintiff? Under Federal Rule 19(a)(2), some people can be made involuntary plaintiffs.

Which is that everybody should have one opportunity to choose their forum, correct? Does your theory fall apart if we don't accept your claim-by-claim analysis? You approach this claim by claim. I'm not quite sure how we can -- you can do that since the statute speaks about a civil action and it talks about removal of an action, not a removal of a claim.

2018,Nieves v. Bartlett,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"So why doesn't qualified immunity take care of that? If -- if -- if, in fact, speech by its nature is disruptive or otherwise interferes with the actions of a police officer, that would give them qualified immunity, whether there was probable cause or not. Well, no, my point is that one of your arguments has been that almost all arrests involve speech, that in some form or another, speech is implicated in the incident of arrest. But if it's truly integrated in this -- in the incident of arrest, something like, I'm going to blow up the President, that's going to give you probable cause, but, more importantly, it's going to give you qualified immunity. Here, the problem is that it wasn't implicated as a reason for arrest. It was a situation between the two, and it came about after the arrest, meaning the statement was made after the arrest. So this is the unusual case, not the normal case. If Police Officer Wright -- -- if Police Officer Wright wasn't present when Officer Nieves had his interaction with -- with the defendant, Respondent here, how could he have been animated by animus? Weight. I'm sorry. I keep thinking Wright, but it is Weight. Why is this any more complex than racial discrimination? Meaning, in almost all situations involving racial discrimination or allegations thereof, it's complex. Mixed motive cases are the norm, not the exception. So why should we treat this differently? We're now tiering things. We're tiering a right, the First Amendment, above -- below racial discrimination. I -- I don't know, are you -- your rule would encompass religious discrimination, and so that's now less important than racial discrimination. Should we be creating exceptions to the clear statutory command that any person who violates a constitutional right should be held responsible? But that's the point, isn't it? Mr. Wall, how do we -- Mr. Wall, the Lohman -- Lozman kind of situation, at least based on the cert petitions that we see, is not so uncommon: small municipalities where people are supporting one police chief over a different one or someone who has alleged that the police department in that municipality is corrupt, and all of a sudden they're getting a slew of, you know, 25 to 50 building code, jaywalking, crossing a yellow light, every misdemeanor, every violation humanly possible. Your rule would insulate that behavior. So the question is, is the burden that you're speaking about of there being, perhaps, you've pointed to 10 examples, the briefs, of cases that in your view should not have gone to a jury in the -- in the -- in the Ninth Circuit, so less than half a percent of the cases that were filed alleging retaliatory arrests have actually gone to trial, is it worth giving up the protections of 1983 for such a fundamental right as the freedom of speech right? So why don't we go back to the rule or why don't you advocate the rule that you set forth in your brief, that a probable cause requirement applies to felonies but not misdemeanors? So you're thinking there are some misdemeanors that are fairly serious? So I see -- I take your point. ",so why do not qualify immunity take care of that if if if in fact speech by its nature be disruptive or otherwise interferes with the action of a police officer that would give them qualify immunity whether there be probable because or not well no my point be that one of your argument have be that almost all arrest involve speech that in some form or another speech be implicate in the incident of arrest but if it be truly integrated in this in the incident of arrest something like I be go to blow up the president that be go to give you probable because but more importantly it be go to give you qualified immunity here the problem be that it be not implicate as a reason for arrest it be a situation between the two and it come about after the arrest mean the statement be make after the arrest so this be the unusual case not the normal case if police officer wright if police officer wright be not present when officer nieves have his interaction with with the defendant respondent here how could he have be animate by animus weight I be sorry i keep think wright but it be weight why be this any more complex than racial discrimination meaning in almost all situation involve racial discrimination or allegation thereof it be complex mixed motive case be the norm not the exception so why should we treat this differently we be now tiering thing we be tiering a right the first amendment above below racial discrimination i i do not know be you your rule would encompass religious discrimination and so that be now less important than racial discrimination should we be create exception to the clear statutory command that any person who violate a constitutional right should be hold responsible but that be the point be not it mr wall how do we mr wall the lohman lozman kind of situation at least base on the cert petition that we see be not so uncommon small municipality where people be support one police chief over a different one or someone who have allege that the police department in that municipality be corrupt and all of a sudden they be get a slew of you know to building code jaywalking cross a yellow light every misdemeanor every violation humanly possible your rule would insulate that behavior so the question be be the burden that you be speak about of there be perhaps you have point to example the brief of case that in your view should not have go to a jury in the in the in the ninth circuit so less than half a percent of the case that we be file allege retaliatory arrest have actually go to trial be it worth give up the protection of for such a fundamental right as the freedom of speech right so why do not we go back to the rule or why do not you advocate the rule that you set forth in your brief that a probable because requirement applies to felony but not misdemeanor so you be think there be some misdemeanor that be fairly serious so i see i take your point ,259.12,Case pending,"Nov 26, 2018","Luis A.

2018,Thacker v. Tennessee Valley Authority,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I'm sorry. Are you denouncing the existence of a core government activity not being immunized? Whether to place a dam or not? No, they're basically the same, which is how far does -- if you recognize some core government functions performed by the TVA, how far does that immunity go? Isn't that the question before us? Counsel, let -- let me phrase it slightly differently. Is your argument based on the sue-to-be -- permission to sue and be sued clause, or is it welded in -- in part in the fact that the TVA was excluded from the FTCA? I think, once you start with that it was excluded, then we have to figure out what applies, right? And why we should keep the FTCA in when Congress told us not to. Correct? There's three entities that were excluded from the FTCA. So how much does your argument rely on the sue-to-be-sued clause or -- or the exclusion of the TVA? All right. So, if it's -- if it's this Court's precedent, then give us a reason addressing Justice Breyer's point, which is the Burr analysis, since, by definition, it has to involve a case-by-case analysis. I think, but I'm not sure, were you saying that so does the discretionary -- So both of them require a case-by-case analysis? I think what Justice Breyer is saying -- I'm sorry, that the discretionary policy exemption is less complex than the Burr rule. That's on step 1. But step 2? Sorry. There are some functions it does that are governmental. We're trying to get to the dividing line. And Justice Alito said, if it's commercial, it should not be subject to any exemption. If it's governmental, are you agreeing that it does receive immunity? All right. So let's assume it does, where to build a dam. Is that governmental enough for you? Well, it seems to me that that's really a close question, isn't it? Let's assume we -- on common ground. There are some functions that are governmental. You're unwilling to specify which at the moment. But do you -- do you agree that there are some functions that may be governmental? So that's fine. The question before us is what to do about the middle stuff, or are you saying this is just commercial? And if you're saying it's just commercial, explain the Chief Justice's description of why it might not be just commercial, and how do we draw that line? Ms. O'Connell, is it, though? As Justice Alito pointed out, it is a hybrid entity. It does governmental functions and it does commercial functions. You'll have to explain to me why raising a power line is a government function. Every -- and I understand there are some private contractors who actually own and operate and sell fuel from dams. If a power line goes down, they have to raise it. Any commercial enterprise that creates a danger has to fix it. That's what businesses do, whether it's the government running the business or not. What is a governmental discretionary policy having to do with creating a danger in the operation of its business, meaning the power line is down, no one's going to say the government is authorized to be negligent in fixing it and harming people? You want to take it to the broader discretion of do I have one or two men, do I give this type of warning or that kind of warning. But why does that take it out of a commercial choice? Why does it put it into a government choice? When this Act can be both government and business? Depending on who the operator is, not because it is the government doing it. It hasn't, but Congress did with the sue-and-be-sued clause. Exactly. It was three agencies that it said are not governed by this. So shouldn't we give meaning to what Congress said? It took it out of. By the way, if it had left it in the FTCA, what additional suits do you think could have been brought -- could not have been brought? Meaning, by giving it a sue-and-to-be-sued clause, what other activities by the TVA would be subject to suit that would not be subject to sue under the But Burr does -- Burr itself recognizes that. Burr says that there are some entities that are sued or to be sued that you have to look at differently because they're not functioning merely as government entities. So do you -- Do you agree that Burr and the discretionary policy exception overlap in some respects? And some of that has to do with governmental functions and the discretion the government has in that area? So you -- you totally give up the idea that there's any overlap between the two? You think they're just totally -- So, if you lose, the way Justice Kavanaugh set up the possible loss, Burr controls, you would give up any claim to discretionary function exemption, you would not claim that this interferes with the government because it cabins its discretionary function? I know, but if you're wrong, if we decide you're wrong, are you here going to disavow relying on the discretionary exemption in claiming that prong 2 is not met under Burr?

And so we talk a lot now about not relying on legislative history but relying on the plain text of the Constitution. Could you tell me what there is in our original case, the Nevada -- in our original case, that didn't address this argument and say it wasn't compelling? What is new from -- Yes. What's -- what -- what is new -- -- in any of the arguments that were raised in Nevada versus Hall that weren't addressed by the Court? I know you say it was wrong. Putting aside the wrongness. Well, I know that's your position, but let's -- So what do you think is the structure, since most sovereign immunity -- there's a lot of customary law involving it, but, at the essence, and it was this way in the United States for a very long time, recognizing the sovereign immunity of a foreign state was at the discretion of the host state. Now the U.S. followed the pattern, but, in the Tate letter, it changed it around. What do you think in the constitutional design reflects the willingness of one state to give up its power to protect its own citizens from the actions of another state who might intrude directly? Now we know, because we recently had a case, that states can be sued. Were you on that case? I can't remember now. That there -- yeah. We had a case recently where there's a question about whether a state can be sued to quiet title in another state. So, if one state owns property in another state, it can be hauled into court to quiet title of that property. So we know that the rule wasn't absolute possibly, and so the question I have is where in the constitutional design do we see, and in light of the -- of the constitutional reservation to states of all powers not designated by the Constitution, their willing -- their ability to protect their own citizens in their own states? Mr. Waxman -- Mr. Waxman, when the states disagreed with us in Chisholm about the ability to haul states into federal court, the states amended the Constitution. We got the Eleventh Amendment. We have 44 states suggesting we overrule Hall. That's two-thirds of the states. Why don't they move to get the Constitution amended if we're getting it wrong? You're asking us to do their work. If this is such a important principle to them, they could express it very directly the way they did in -- in the Eleventh Amendment. They've got a lot of -- -- representatives in the House and in the Senate. If they're really excised, they can do something about it. Except -- but, instead, they're choosing to let us decide -- -- that an individual state doesn't have the right to protect its citizens. But this is a very serious step. We are entrenching very directly on the state's right to protect its citizens. And there are amici who suggest that there are principles that can cabin that. We've already recognized them. This turned -- this turned from a multimillion-dollar case into, what, a $100,000 case now? Well, that's because of the attorneys, but -- (Laughter.) Always the attorneys. Mr. Chemerinsky, your -- Mr. Waxman did point to something that's important. Intuitively and otherwise, we would say it would be wrong for one state to tell another state how to run its government or how to run an agency or what rules it should follow within its own state. What in -- then what is it that keeps them from doing that if it's not the constitutional structure? I -- I just don't see comity being enough. I know one of your amici suggested that questions of personal jurisdiction should take care of most cases. And, actually, I did look at this case and I was trying to figure out what it was that Nevada did to intrude or what California did to intrude physically on Nevada. And I know that the supposed agent who was doing this investigation -- not supposed, she is an agent -- crossed state lines, I think it was alleged, and rummaged through garbage and rummaged through personal mail. Is that correct? But was that in Nevada or in California? I'm sorry, he could have gone to the California courts. There's no -- there's no administrative process against the -- the tax assessment that was laid against him? That -- that actually is a factual question I had. Did -- was that ever adjudicated? Could the Nevada court have adjudicated the factual premises? Could he have brought some sort of suit in Nevada to adjudicate whether he was a resident of California or not or to find that he had no tax liability? ",counsel it be nice that they felt that way but what we know be they do not put it in the constitution and so we talk a lot now about not rely on legislative history but rely on the plain text of the constitution could you tell me what there be in our original case the nevada in our original case that do not address this argument and say it be not compel what be new from yes what be what what be new in any of the argument that we be raise in nevada versus hall that be not address by the court i know you say it be wrong put aside the wrongness well i know that be your position but let us so what do you think be the structure since most sovereign immunity there be a lot of customary law involve it but at the essence and it be this way in the united state for a very long time recognize the sovereign immunity of a foreign state be at the discretion of the host state now the us follow the pattern but in the tate letter it change it around what do you think in the constitutional design reflect the willingness of one state to give up its power to protect its own citizen from the action of another state who might intrude directly now we know because we recently have a case that state can be sue we be you on that case i can not remember now that there yeah we have a case recently where there be a question about whether a state can be sue to quiet title in another state so if one state own property in another state it can be haul into court to quiet title of that property so we know that the rule be not absolute possibly and so the question i have be where in the constitutional design do we see and in light of the of the constitutional reservation to state of all power not designate by the constitution their willing their ability to protect their own citizen in their own state mr waxman mr waxman when the state disagree with us in chisholm about the ability to haul state into federal court the state amend the constitution we get the eleventh amendment we have state suggest we overrule hall that be two third of the state why do not they move to get the constitution amend if we be get it wrong you be ask us to do their work if this be such a important principle to them they could express it very directly the way they do in in the eleventh amendment they have get a lot of representative in the house and in the senate if they be really excise they can do something about it except but instead they be choose to let us decide that an individual state do not have the right to protect its citizen but this be a very serious step we be entrench very directly on the state s right to protect its citizen and there be amici who suggest that there be principle that can cabin that we have already recognize them this turn this turn from a multimillion dollar case into what a case now well that be because of the attorney but laughter always the attorney mr chemerinsky your mr waxman do point to something that be important intuitively and otherwise we would say it would be wrong for one state to tell another state how to run its government or how to run an agency or what rule it should follow within its own state what in then what be it that keep them from do that if it be not the constitutional structure i i just do not see comity be enough i know one of your amici suggest that question of personal jurisdiction should take care of most case and actually i do look at this case and i be try to figure out what it be that nevada do to intrude or what california do to intrude physically on nevada and i know that the suppose agent who be do this investigation not suppose she be an agent cross state line i think it be allege and rummage through garbage and rummage through personal mail be that correct but be that in nevada or in california I be sorry he could have go to the california court there be no there be no administrative process against the the tax assessment that be lay against him that that actually be a factual question i have do be that ever adjudicate could the nevada court have adjudicate the factual premise could he have bring some sort of suit in nevada to adjudicate whether he be a resident of california or not or to find that he have no tax liability ,331.63,Case pending,"Jan 9, 2019",Franchise Tax Board of California,Gilbert P.

2018,Lorenzo v. Securities and Exchange Commission,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Excuse me, Janus was a private cause of action, correct? Under 10b-5? I -- I understand what Janus said, but I don't know how it squares with 17(a). And you swept 17(a) in. 10b-5 uses the phrase ""to make"" any untrue statement. But 17(a) says to obtain money or property by means of any -- of any untrue statement of a material fact. That seems dramatically different to me. 17(a) is a government provision, meaning only the government can sue under 17(a). Why should we be treating the two identically? I don't know that anywhere in your brief you explain that. I know that we've had -- made general statements that the two inform each other, but certainly not on this critical point, because Janus was based explicitly on the ""making"" language of 10b-5(b). But -- but do we have a -- I have a problem with -- I'm sorry, I'm having -- -- I'm having a problem from the beginning. Once you concede, which I think you did, that you're not challenging that your client acted with an intent to deceive or defraud, that you aren't challenging the D.C. Circuit's conclusion to that effect? Is that correct? I don't understand, once you concede that mental state, and he has the act of putting together the email and encouraging customers to call him with questions, not to call his boss with questions, how could that standing alone give away your case? I mean, that -- that makes him both the maker of a false statement, whether his boss shared it or not, and I know the courts below thought differently, but it's also engaging in an act, practice, or course of conduct which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person. Whether he was a maker or not, he was encouraging the customers to call him directly about buying or -- buying what was being offered. I'm -- that's what I'm having trouble with. Whether 17(a)(2) was charged or not is irrelevant, because the way 17(a) is structured, it's not controlled by Janus at all. Because it doesn't talk about making statements. It talks about obtaining money or property by statements. There's no reason why we should limit, under Janus or otherwise, limit (3) from -- or 17(a)(1) or (3) from taking their natural meaning. If you make a materially false statement intentionally, which you've conceded he did, then he engaged in a transaction, practice, or course of business which operated or would operate as a fraud. He wasn't the maker -- -- but he had the scienter. And you're not disputing that. Why didn't you charge -- I'm sorry. Just so I understand the SG's position on this issue, do you believe that Janus controls 17(a)(2)? You didn't charge it or it wasn't charged here.

2018,United States v. Haymond,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Is there any other area of the law in which we permit imprisonment by a preponderance of the evidence? Whether it's a jury -- Right. Well, in parole, the original sentence was already X number of years, and the state granted a benefit and said, instead of serving 10 years, we'll let you serve eight if you behave. If you don't, you've got to finish serving the two that we imposed originally. But where do we ever permit someone to be jailed for an additional period of time other than their original sentence? On a preponderance of the evidence? Well, that's the facts of -- That's -- that's almost like harmless error argument. If his term -- there's no question now that his term of supervised release extends further than his original sentence, no? Well, his jail sentence does. But we're still back to the same -- We're still -- no, it's not quite, because he was sentenced originally to the 38 months, not to another term of jail. Now we're adding on to that an additional term of incarceration and an additional term of supervised release, so we've stretched the maximum of his earlier term. But you're trying to mix -- to compare apples and oranges. In the parole situation, the original sentence was the additional sentence that he got. Here, he only got the 38 months. A jury didn't find facts sufficient to give him the additional years he received by the judge's finding. Well, let -- let's talk about this. Could Congress impose a system that says on the day of sentencing, you're going to be sentenced to X number of years, but if a judge finds that you committed X act, you can be sentenced to -- instead of 38 months, to eight years? Can a judge do that under Apprendi? Not a charged crime; it's just an act. Whatever the act may be. No, no, no. We know under Apprendi, I think it's pretty clear under Apprendi, that if the sentence says you committed X crime, you get five years, but if you did it with racial hatred, Apprendi, and a judge finds that by a preponderance of the evidence, you get eight years. Apprendi says no, you can't do that. The jury has to find that you did that additional element, correct? I'm trying to figure out why a judge now gets to say, after you've been sentenced to the five years, instead of five years for the original crime, I'm going to find by a preponderance of the evidence, after you've been sentenced to the five years, that we really should have given you eight years. Because you've now committed a new crime or a new -- not a new crime, but a new -- well, a new crime or a new act, whatever that act may be. You know, if it looks like -- Mr. Feigin, I -- I have, I guess, a fundamental problem. The way this provision reads, it basically says, if you commit X crime, you get a minimum of X number of years reimprisonment and we lift the cap on your supervised release. You know, if it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, walks like a duck, it's a duck. And what it seems to be saying is, if you commit this crime, you go to jail for this minimum number of years. I thought that it was baked into our criminal system that if a judge is going to make a finding like that, that you committed a crime, and that it's going to increase either your minimum or your maximum of whatever the original jury -- jury or whatever the jury found, that you're entitled to a jury to find that fact beyond a reasonable doubt. So you say Apprendi was Sixth Amendment, but Apprendi was both the Fifth and Sixth Amendment, and the two interacted in the Apprendi decision, was a due process concern as well. And so I have a due process concern as well as a Sixth Amendment concern, which is, if we're asking a judge to find you committed a crime under the Fifth Amendment, how can we permit reimprisonment, something as drastic as reimprisonment on such a low burden of proof? But we -- we've already talked -- -- about the differences between parole and this. In parole, he was sentenced to life. He was given a benefit to be gotten out early or go back to jail to finish his term. It's a very different situation than being told you're going to serve 10 years, 15, 20, you've done with the jail time, and now, if you go out, we can now reimprison you for 50 years minimum, as opposed to 20. But I don't see how a minimum can be anything but. Because, here, the judge very clearly -- the judge and the court of appeals very clearly said that if this had been a crime that would be determined beyond a reasonable doubt, they don't think the government could win. And the judge even said that he thought the sentence was inappropriate to the nature of the allegations and proof in this case. But how does -- how does a mandatory minimum, the Alleyne problem, where we said that really should be determined by a jury, not a judge, how does a mandatory minimum deal with a breach of trust? Once you've tied a judge's hands in the sentence, then how does that promote -- -- the respect for the breach of trust? If the judge doesn't believe that's the right sentence, why would that promote the needs of the community? So why couldn't a remedy, instead of requiring a jury trial or striking down this part of this provision, which the Tenth Circuit did, why couldn't a simple remedy in your view be adequate that says the judge can do anything within the original sentence? And if your -- if your reincent -- if your reimposition requires a minimum of five years and that's what you got, we'll strike that down. The judge doesn't have to do that. He can do whatever he wants within the original imprisonment time or the original terms of supervised release, maximum terms. Subjected to under (k)? And he didn't -- It's too much for the -- -- original crime that didn't require it. Authorized it but didn't require a minimum. Are you -- ",be there any other area of the law in which we permit imprisonment by a preponderance of the evidence whether it be a jury right well in parole the original sentence be already x number

You didn't -- you -- you're arguing you didn't get a fair and full opportunity to litigate this in Repsis? In Repsis, there wasn't a fair opportunity? All right. Was that because when the Tenth -- I thought the Tenth Circuit there asked for further briefing, correct? Oh. In the -- Right. Oh, okay. Why not? Go back to Judge Kavanaugh's question. The language is nearly identical. Wouldn't we have to say that Race Horse is overruled to come to a different conclusion? How would we distinguish the two? You know, Justice -- Chief Justice Rehnquist -- I don't know if he was Chief back then -- said that we had -- that the majority had effectively overruled Race Horse, and so have commentators. So should we just say it? And you still haven't told me what factually is different between the two treaty provisions -- -- that would distinguish them sufficient for us to say we're applying the new logic and this treaty provision fits that new logic, plus it's different from Race Horse, why? You haven't filled in that blank. Would you please stop talking in generalities? Give me a specific in which way are the two tribes or their history different? I'm sorry. For -- This killing was on -- -- this killing was on federal land, correct? In all state -- in all federal parks, state regulations apply? Okay. I just wasn't aware of that. All right. All right. So that's wonderful. Tell me how a national park isn't a traditional hunting district. I mean, the government says we're not going to keep it unoccupied. They open it up to hunting. What was different back then? Unoccupied and people went hunting. So tell me what in the treaty says it automatically terminates. I saw a lot of conditions. I saw the game disappearing, the land becoming occupied, but I don't see on statehood or even anything approaching it. Where -- where in -- just point me to something in the treaty language -- -- that -- that gives you -- Who gave -- whose settlement? Who -- tell me the settlement history. All right. And non-Indians settled how? By grants by the federal government, correct? Who ran the General Land Office? Okay. So, if the United States had changed the General Land Office to some other method, which they have, that terminated the treaty? We're forgetting the other side in this discussion, because the tribe has a subsistence right. I know under the facts of this case you're claiming the killings were not for subsistence, an open question, I'm not taking a side on that.

2018,Air and Liquid Systems Corp. v. Devries,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I'm sorry -- -- how is your product not the cause of the injury? The asbestos as sold is perfectly safe. It's integrated. It's whole. It doesn't release molecules. What causes it to degrade is your ship, is your product. Your product heats up to such an extreme degree that it degenerates the asbestos. So it's somewhat incongruous for me to think that you're saying that the harm's caused by the asbestos. The asbestos is in this shape because of what you did to it, meaning your product did to it. It's an integrated product. It's not standing alone. In -- in normal tort law, if you create a car that has a spark in the tank, and the gasoline, which is what explodes the car, explodes, the consumer is not going to sue the gasoline company. It's going to sue you because you, the car manufacturer, produced a defective product that caused an injury that the gasoline would otherwise not cause. Why are you any different than the bare-metal car seller? That's the fault -- But in those -- in those situations, it wasn't foreseeable. They didn't know it was going to cause a blood clot. I -- I think you -- what do I make of the fact that this is maritime law, which is different, and that you claim there's a uniform tort principle, but not every state has the absolute rule that you tout? There's a split of authorities among states as to the extent of liability, if any, for bare-metal providers. So what do I do if I'm in a special area with a solicitude for sailors and I don't buy your argument that we should ignore that principle or overturn it after two centuries of case law on it? Assume I accept the principle. That's a separate defense. Forget the Navy. Let's assume the Navy was not involved -- It was a private -- any private person. I'm sorry, why -- I'm sorry. I -- I don't understand your point about the future and a change. If you've warned that asbestos products are dangerous and you should exercise care in removing them, then it's the people down the line who choose to continue doing it, you're off the hook because you gave them a warning. This is a failure to warn claim. If you did what you were supposed to do, that doesn't take away their incentive to change to a less dangerous product if it's cheaper or if it's easier to deal with. I'm not sure what that -- why that increases cost in some meaningful way.

2018,Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. v. Albrecht,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Why? Please point me to where in the complete response letter you say that they were -- thought stress fractures were the same as the atypical fractures. As I'm reading the response letter, it's -- and -- and this is what they said to you: Your justification for the proposed precaution section language is inadequate -- inadequate identification of ""stress fractures."" May not be clearly related to the atypical -- forget that word -- fractures that have been reported in the literature. Discussion of the risk factors for stress fractures is not warranted and is not adequately supported by the available literature. Nowhere did they say that the atypical fractures are not supported by the literature, and nowhere did they say don't change it. The rest of the letter tells you make changes and we'll come back and talk more about this. I look at their argument that the conversation that your person had with them was saying to them: We're thinking about this. Now come back with something else, and maybe we'll give you what you want; maybe we won't. But I don't think, from the complete response letter, if you're a textualist, that you can look at it and say that they were saying no to an atypical fracture warning. They were certainly saying no to a stress warning. So read me something in the complete response letter, from that letter standing alone, that you could draw your conclusion. But the statutory background basically says the only way that you advise someone to change a label, as I understand it, is if it's minor changes. This would be a major change. And so, by regulatory standards, they would have been acting improperly if they had approved your language with telling you make some cosmetic changes, because they didn't think this was cosmetic. Doesn't mean they're right. I read the statute. I don't read them. Why? Why? Merck is a manufacturer of a drug. It has a tort duty to ensure that its drugs are either safe or that adequate warnings are given when it's not. The Act does not take away that responsibility. It does say that you have to get approval from the FDA. But, if there's any ambiguity, given that we're already creating something that doesn't exist, impossibility preemption, why shouldn't we take it at its -- at its face? Until the FDA says no, if you're a manufacturer who understands there's a serious risk to a drug, shouldn't you continue to try everything possible, including making the corrections that you were told to make, including doing what the task force did, telling the FDA you're wrong? Instead, what Merck did was say, I'm absolved, I don't have to make the changes, I don't have to talk to them anymore, I just have to let them -- ""them"" being the FDA -- figure out what to do. Seems to be sort of turning responsibility on its head. Not true. It could go the other route and make the change itself and wait for the FDA to tell it it's wrong. So what happens here to the incentive for manufacturers to continue working expeditiously with the FDA to effect changes when they're necessary? Could -- Could you -- Mr. Frederick, let's be -- coming down to practical, okay? You say earlier that the Merck scientists were saying, when they received this letter, the FDA doesn't like our language. What do you suggest Merck could have done without changing its label until the FDA would have approved it? And why do you believe that you can convince a jury that, if they had done it your way, the FDA would have accepted the new label? Well, we know that the FDA -- assuming the theory that the FDA doesn't believe the label is adequate, what could they have done -- -- absent the study? Meaning because the study obviously changed the FDA's mind. You're saying, you, Merck, could have done it. And that wasn't communicated by Merck to the FDA? Is that what you're saying? How about the manufacturer's duty to work with the FDA to ensure that the label is right and that it has all pertinent information to reconsider its initial decision? Mr. Frederick said there were only five of 170 articles provided to the FDA. Your own scientists said they're confused. Doesn't Merck have an obligation to show that, if presented with the proper language and the proper evidence, that the FDA would have -- or don't you have to show would have still denied the right label? Isn't that your burden? It didn't. You never gave them a proper language and you never gave them what your scientists told you to give them.

Shall apply to contracts of employment of seamen, railroad employees, or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce. Congress didn't use the word ""employees"" if it meant employees. It used a much broader term, ""workers."" Shouldn't that inform what it meant by ""contract of employment""? No. But it said it shall apply to any other class of workers, not employees. It used a much broader term. But what we're trying to decide is what employment -- ""contract of employment"" means. And if it meant only employees, Congress naturally, I would assume, would have used the word ""any other class of employees,"" but instead it chose a much broader word, ""workers."" Well, except your adversary has pointed out that under the Seamen Act, it covered people who were not contracts of -- seamen are not just people who are employees; it also is the tugboat operator who's on the boat guiding it. It's other people who are not simply employees. Except the problem is that we don't really assume that because the other side has prevented us -- presented us with multiple cases, many of them in which we've used ""contract of employment"" to mean employees and independent contractors.

I -- I -- I thought, for virtually every other purpose in tax law, labor law -- I just don't know another area where we take the form of the contract as dispositive of a legal issue, of whether you're an employee or an independent contractor?

2018,Nutraceutical Corp. v. Lambert,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"The problem with Carlisle and Robinson is that they were well before our explanation of there being a difference between jurisdiction and non-jurisdiction claim processing rules. And we were a little bit loose back then in terms of our textual approach to things. Justice Gorsuch's question, though, is a fair one because it's the practice of the Supreme Court with respect to filing of amicus briefs that we don't grant extensions but we take late amicus. And so why can't we look at the exact words of 26(b) and say, no, you can't extend the time, but a court has, as it always has, equitable discretion to take something that's filed late because, assuming that the facts qualify as equitable, and that's open to question, I know, in this case, but assuming, why don't we read the provision as it states, a court can permit an act to be done after that time expires? I'm sorry, you'll need to explain that to me because I'm not following you. The problem is that we really wouldn't -- yes, you're right, we would be revisiting Robinson, but we would be saying that the words of a statute have meaning, and Robinson read out of that permission the equitable considerations that the very statute permitted. That's a -- that's a circle with no out because 2 refers to 26(b), and if we read 26(b) the way I suggest, that already builds in the equitable exception. But, in terms of the purpose of the rule, we have previously said that 26(b) gives -- 26(f) gives the court, the trial court, almost unfettered discretion whether to grant the motion to appeal. And if that's the case, wouldn't the natural reading of this be that the court should have unfettered discretion to decide if a late filing makes it think that the issue is more important than it might otherwise have thought? Yes. Counsel, on what ground would we overrule the circuit's rejection of that argument? You raised it below. It explicitly didn't rule on that basis. It held that you had filed the motion after the 14 days. What ground do we have to disagree with the circuit court on that? Exactly. The leave to file a motion -- the motion for leave to file an appeal, you didn't tell the judge you were intending to do that, did you? So how was the judge supposed to play lawyer? He's supposed to tell you -- you ask him, let me file a motion for reconsideration, he's supposed to protect you and be your lawyer and tell you, you know, if you file it next week, you're going to lose your time to appeal? I don't know of any case we've ever held where a judge has to tell you something when you don't ask the judge about that. If we reject that, do you lose?

2018,Nielsen v. Preap,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"So what meaning do you give to when the alien is released? Does it command you to do anything? So you don't see any sense of urgency in your acting, no sense of encouraging you -- -- in some way to actually do what the statute says -- -- which is to take custody of somebody? So tell me why would you have -- need transition rules under your reading of this statute, which there were. And the transition rules said you have two years, essentially, to put in place enough personnel and facilities to do what the statute requires you to do. Why did you need that two-year period if, in your view, you have absolute discretion -- -- to pick an alien up whenever you want to any way? No, no, no. But why did you need the transition rules at all? If you have discretion, as you claim to have, to decide when you're going to pick up an alien, either the day of release or, in one case, before -- 11 years later, you didn't need the transition rules. You could have just done what you needed to do to create the bed space or get the personnel and start arresting people when you thought you could. So let's go to -- -- let's go to the release provision. Paragraph (1) is an entire paragraph. It describes a type of alien and an alien who's picked up at a particular time. So, if the statute intended this lack of authority to kick in if the alien only met (A) through (D), why doesn't the statute say that? Why doesn't it say paragraph (1), (A) through (D)? It -- it describes the type of alien we're talking about. It describes the person who's subject to this provision. Let's say -- That only works -- You -- you -- Ms. Wang, you -- Ms. Wang, let's assume a situation, hypothetical. The government goes to the jail that day. They're told they're going to -- the prisoner's going to get out at 10 in the morning, but he gets out at 7. They then go looking for him, and he's now gone underground, never shows up at the parole office, never talks to family or friends. They look for him periodically over a period of time. And all of a sudden he's rearrested. Do you see that as a different reasonable time situation than what happens here, which is that the government -- for example, I understand from the briefs that sometimes they put in a detainer and don't even bother to show up? So, if there is a difference, why are we marking a temporal limit on what ""reasonable effort to comply with the statute"" might mean? It seems to me Justice Breyer's right, that the law is filled with the reasonable effort to comply with the terms of a command, but I don't see how we can set a temporal limit to that reasonable effort in the way that you're promoting. It just begs the question, because they didn't say sub -- paragraph (1), A through D. They said the entire paragraph. And why isn't the verb, the adverb, part of the noun in that situation? Because, if they wanted to limit it to that class of A to D, that's the easiest thing to have done. Your counsel is -- your adversary's right, if they wanted to limit 1226(a) to (c)(2), they would have said (c)(2). No, it is -- it is -- You're begging the question. When he's released identifies the alien that the statute is looking at. You by yourself -- you say that there's a command that you have to follow to try to take these people into custody. You say there's a command to do it, but you don't have to do it. You can choose not to do it. I don't know what kind of command that is. But you -- you at least recognize that there's a sense of urgency, you should do this. So why doesn't that describe the noun? The noun and the verb, I should say. The problem is that -- -- if that's the only way you come -- that -- become aware of them, they get arrested, you can hold them. You can do what you should have done the first time, which is to -- -- put a detainer on them. I guess the problem that I have is you're -- you're pitting two groups of people. I'm not nay-saying that there are people who are released on bail who are dangerous and commit -- and commit serious crimes.

2018,Stokeling v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I'm sorry. Does that apply -- your answer apply to the armed robbery subsections of the Florida statute? I'm sorry, we used the example of a tap on the shoulder not being sufficient force. So can you answer Justice Alito's hypothetical? Is a pinch, an ordinary pinch -- let's not talk about an extraordinary -- (Laughter.) -- pulling of the ears that a parent might sometimes do. Let's talk about just a pinch. (Laughter.) Is that sufficient force? If we said a tap on the shoulder couldn't be, why could a pinch be? You've -- -- you've said the reasonable -- and I do understand your point, which is, from personal experience, if you tap an injured shoulder, it could cause injury. It's capable of causing physical pain and injury. But we said, in the normal course of circumstances, a tap on the shoulder would not -- is not capable of producing injury. So -- I'm sorry? What? And that's the point. So I know you use ""reasonably expected,"" but is it reasonably expected or just simply capable in -- in -- in the normal course to -- But the problem is -- I'm sorry. The problem is, just in common parlance, the definition that the courts have given in Florida is the slightest resistance qualifies as violent force so that if the victim just merely moves you away and you push him back -- -- that's the slightest force. But that's not the words the Court has used. It said the slightest resistance and the slightest force used to overcome it qualify as a robbery. And under the categorical approach, I thought that we had to eliminate something that was slight. So the force can be of any degree? No, because what you have is slight force over slight -- slight resistance and slight force to overcome it. How do you get past that into that it's a tug of war? I mean, some people grab you by your arm and you just pull it away, and it doesn't necessarily have to be a very forceful pulling away. But, I'm sorry -- -- you keep using the word ""fight."" But the statute just says the least resistance met by the least force. That's not a fight in my dictionary. The fact that somebody has something and pulls back and you just walk away with it, that's not substantial force. But how does that define it as a substantial force? Even as capable of producing injury, if the example that the Chief used, an elderly victim, just simply can be overcome with no -- virtually no force whatsoever? Then that's not capable of causing injury, even in an elderly person? All right. How about a pickpocket that walks away and someone grabs them lightly and they just pull their arm and keep walking? As I read the Florida statute, that would cover that as well. Not force directed by the victim or resistance by the victim but resistance by someone else in the course of the taking. No, victim goes over, pickpockets -- I'm sorry. The thief walks over, pickpockets the victim, turns around, starts to walk away, and a passerby grabs hold of his arm, and he pulls it away and keeps walking. So what do you think -- Not the way I read the statute. It says when in the course of the taking, there is a use of force, violence, assault, or putting in fear. In the course of? But it has to be directed at the victim? If there's a Florida case -- -- to the contrary, then do you lose? This really has -- sounds like we're overruling Johnson and reintroducing into the categorical approach this whole notion of what's the normal situation. I -- I -- I guess, if I'm looking at something in a categorical way, I'm saying little force is not substantial force, period, end of story.

2018,Weyerhaeuser Company v. United States Fish and Wildlife Service,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"This is a royal we. As I understand it, the only appellant before us is yours, who's the lessee of the timberland, who owns a de minimis amount of acres. So it wasn't the lessee of the timber cutting. It was the separate owner of the land who's incurred these expenses, and that's not an appellant before us, is it? But who are you representing? I thought the -- Can I go back to a question? As I was reading the evidence in this case, it appeared that there was a dispute as to whether this frog could, in fact, survive, maybe not as healthily as it does now, and maybe not for the very long term, but there was evidence that the frog was there for, I think, 10 or 15 years while timber cutting was occurring. There was some scientific evidence that there were stumps that the frog might be able to survive in, as opposed to the canopied forest. I -- I -- I know that the Fifth Circuit said that there was no dispute this wasn't currently habitable, but I think that depended on what definition you gave to habitable. If we give a different definition, what would be the minimum, if it didn't include the PCEs that you think are necessary? Because I don't know that unoccupied has to be an optimal survival place, and if it doesn't have to be optimal, what would otherwise be a minimum? But that -- but that definition was never provided? I think it's begging -- it's begging the question, which is I don't know that the circuit below actually accepted your definition or whether your definition, for the reasons I indicated just a few minutes ago, covered all of the conditions that could make for survival for the species. As I read the record, there were suggestions by some of the scientists that what -- what you admitted to Justice Kagan a little while ago, minimal work, this species could survive, albeit not robustly, but it could survive. Wouldn't that be enough? Well, I don't want to argue the record now. The question is, if I come away having reviewed it with a question about whether the Circuit actually addressed that question and defined what it thought the minimal requirements for habitat were, wouldn't be -- wouldn't the answer be to remand this case and let it make that determination? Well, that's your -- well, that's your adversary -- Assuming what I said -- -- would a remand be appropriate? Okay. Mister -- Mr. Kneedler, in your brief, you give a meaning to ""habitat"" which, frankly, is very different than its dictionary meaning. Pages 27 to 28, you argue that ""habitat can include some areas where a species does not live and cannot ever live, even with restoration."" That's very different than what you started your argument with today. It's very different than what you've done with the Santa Ana sucker, for example. If we disagree with you, where does that leave you in this case? I'm not -- we're not looking at that. Let's assume I take the dictionary definition of ""habitat,"" which is the kind of place that is natural for the life and growth of an animal or plant. That's a fairly simple, natural place. Could this -- is this a natural place for this frog to live? And, if not, do -- is the difference between you and your colleague whether some reasonable restoration can be made or not? And was I all that -- So if we were -- So can we talk about -- I -- I see your point with talking about a kind of place, and it does seem logical that the frogs were there and they were there for a very long time. They were there during the timber cutting. But they left. They left or they were destroyed. So I -- what is it about the natural -- the native environment that still exists there and what is it that you think, with very little reasonable effort, that you could change to make it sustaining for a long period of time again? The PCEs, I know. That's my point. But that's only if it's designated critical habitat. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I think I read that if these ponds are not designated, that there are no other ponds in the United States. So, to the extent that these ponds are not designated critical habitat, and don't survive, this frog won't, if there's a drought or other conditions in Mississippi. But they don't have to. If it's critical -- -- they can designate it and then a deliberate process goes on where they talk to the owners, and you come to an accommodation. That's what generally happens.

2018,Henry Schein Inc. v. Archer and White Sales Inc.,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Could I -- could I -- You just said the parties agreed to have the arbitrator decide this issue. Assume the Douglas -- facts of the Douglas case. Plaintiff, or Petitioner, signed an arbitration agreement over an account and the account was closed within a year, and years later sues the bank for -- for some malfeasance by a lawyer who took money from a different account or something like it. I think I'm getting the facts of Douglas. And the court -- and the arbitrator there improperly assumes jurisdiction. There's been a delegation. What are the -- what are the potential outs for the party who's now been stuck in an arbitration that legally is wholly groundless? The arbitrator made a mistake. Exactly. Basically, you're telling me at least on the express terms of enforcing an arbitration award under the statute, there is no remedy for that Douglas party? If -- if -- If we -- if we accept manifest disregard. We haven't done that yet. But there's no statutory provision under the Act? Do you think that -- Do you think that it could be the arbitrator exceeding their powers? Can -- can you understand the common sense resistance to the idea that, if a party has not agreed to arbitrate a particular issue because it's wholly groundless, there is no way that an arbitrator could in good faith and without error reach a conclusion that arbitration was agreed to, seems counterintuitive to believe that we're sending a party to arbitration, to potentially go through the expense of arbitration when something's wholly groundless, and then potentially not to have an avenue of relief when it comes to enforcing the arbitration award. That's why -- I'm sorry -- that's why I think one of the amici said the courts are not understanding that, at the core, this is always about have you agreed to arbitrate an issue? And, if you haven't, you shouldn't be forced to. But your position is contrary to Rent-A- -- Rent-A-Center? So explain it to me, because I think Rent-A-Center said that that language is limited to was there an agreement between the parties and was there a delegation; and if there is, don't look to the merits. I don't see how determining whether something is wholly groundless is anything but a merits determination. I'm sorry. Was there an agreement? There was an agreement. The Rent-A- -- Rent-A-Center didn't say that at all. Rent-A-Center said don't look at the merits at all. It didn't carve out -- -- a particular form of the merits. But doesn't -- Mr. Geyser, the problem is that you're taking the position here that this was wholly groundless to consider a mixed injunctive relief and damages claim as being covered by this arbitration award. The other side makes a very compelling argument that, no, there's actually a ground to -- to say that injunctive relief goes to the court, but damages go to arbitrators. And when we have mixed claims, most courts will either send the matter to arbitration and stay the injunctive relief until the arbitration's over. If they determine that both can go simultaneously, they do it. But there are plenty of cases with mixed questions that courts handle all the time. My difficulty is that I don't know where to draw that line. I don't know where what's wholly frivolous to you may not be to someone else. And if there's been a true delegation, why shouldn't that go to the arbitrator? Don't go to the facts of this case. Let's assume a clear delegation. Because I know you're making arguments about the ABA, but we didn't grant cert on that. No. Are you claiming -- because you're arguing that this case is wholly groundless because that's the ground that arbitration was not ordered by the court below. This is the quintessential case where most of these cases are on the margin. And I've actually gone and had the library do research. The number of wholly groundless cases is very small. So, you know, mistakes are made even by judges. So the fact that the four or five arbitrators who make a mistake, I don't know if that's statistically different than judges making mistakes. That's my problem with this case. It may be extremely weak, and I'm not sure that's true, but -- Well, we have a magistrate judge who disagreed and we have other courts in other circuits, I'll bet, but we have other courts who have read it exactly the way they read it. And so it can't be wholly frivolous when you have so many people split on an issue. Sorry, but is this a sensible system where, even though we only have five cases over a long period of time in which courts have denied arbitration on wholly frivolous grounds, we're now inviting this fight in every motion to compel arbitration -- -- and that itself will multiply expenses? Maybe not in your individual case but as a burden on courts. So it's not clear to me that your solution is more efficient in a meaningful way. Only if you win. If you win in court. It's not academic because our answer has a consequence. If we agree with him that there is no statutory provision for wholly groundless exceptions, then all the other questions have to go back and be actually answered. Well, that's only because you intend to win all the other questions. (Laughter.) I can't tell you that.

2018,Biestek v. Berryhill,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"That was after -- -- that was after this case. All right. So that wasn't in place at the time. Can I go back to Justice Breyer's initial question, and perhaps Justice Alito's. You say very explicitly in your reply brief you're not asking for an absolute rule that an -- that an expert must, before testifying, produce these materials. You make an exception for when it's asked for. But you also concede in your reply brief that there might be situations where it's not necessary, where the expert opines, doesn't produce their materials, but there's other independent evidence that's reliable and could be relied upon to constitute substantial evidence. And so there's no absolute rule according to you. But what you're asking us now to hold, I think, is that, as a matter of law, an expert who opines on something and refuses to provide the sources is sufficiently unreliable that it doesn't constitute substantial evidence. Is that what you're trying -- -- to get us to -- All right. You're defining meaningful. But let's -- let me pose a hypothetical. Expert says what this expert says, and you get up and say: How many of these people had the same conditions as my client has? And the expert says: Virtually every one of them. How many people did you do research on with respect to this issue? I contacted about 15 businesses. Have you placed these kinds of individuals in the kinds of jobs you've talked about? Yes, a hundred of them. Whatever -- do you believe that, in that circumstance, you could stand here and say that there wasn't substantial evidence from which the ALJ could rely upon, even if you had not seen the underlying records? I'm giving you the best case for them, because the better case for you is for her to say: Well, I've never really placed anyone with that -- with those conditions. I only checked one employer. But I'm extrapolating from that some sort of methodology that really could be questionable. Those are the two extremes we have, isn't it? All right, the potential extremes we have. But no one asked any of those questions below for us to make a judgment about whether the ALJ's ruling was reasonable or not. But I think you're missing the point, which is you wouldn't have needed the surveys to make the argument you just made. You could have questioned the expert and shown the lack of a sufficient basis for their conclusion and then made that argument to the ALJ. What I'm trying to get at is I understand the need in some situations to actually see the surveys, but don't you have to lay at least some predicate ground for why that's necessary in your particular case? Then doesn't that solve this case? Because your agency now has in its handbook that every expert has to come prepared to cite the sources that they relied upon and to produce the materials. So, if they've made that judgment, why shouldn't we make the same judgment, that a failure to do so goes to the heart of the expert's unreliability? Do you want to show me where in the handbook -- -- that's said so I know -- so I can follow you? The source. So they are picking numbers from the air? Aren't they given the -- the file before they come to testify -- -- on the individual claimant? You're worrying me that this is, in fact, what all of the critics are saying. That these are numbers pulled out of a hat as a person sits there. Mr. Yang -- Mr. Yang, it's really -- I'm sorry. Does it matter who -- Mr. Yang, you seem to, in answering Justice Gorsuch, believe that because the ALJ was the one who said, I'm not going to order that, that that somehow elevates the prior answer into being reliable? I mean, no expert is the judge in a case, correct? The judge has to accept the testimony. All right? So how can an ALJ accept testimony for which it's blocked an answer about how the expert came to their conclusion? That -- that's his basic argument -- -- which is this testimony is unreliable because I was blocked from being able to show a basis -- No. I could get on the stand and say anything I want. And if the ALJ stops the other side from giving the bases for that, the record is devoid of a basis for that answer, and it's unreliable for that reason. That, I think, is the core of their argument. Well, that's -- that's fascinating because there was a whole exchange at the beginning of this hearing where the ALJ asked the attorney to stipulate to the expertise of the expert, and the attorney refused to do so. And he said because -- But not to the expertise and certainly not to the fact that the expertise matches the disabilities at issue in this case. Doesn't that shift the burden? Isn't it your burden to prove that those jobs exist? Why is it their burden to show the basis for your expert's opinion? It's me getting up there and just saying this is the number, believe me. ",that be after that be after this case all right so that be not in place at the time can i go back to justice breyer s initial question and perhaps justice alito s you say very explicitly in your reply brief you be not ask for an absolute rule that an that an expert must before testify produce these material you make an exception for when it be ask for but you also concede in your reply brief that there might be situation where it be not necessary where the expert opines do not produce their material but there be other independent evidence that be reliable and could be rely upon to constitute substantial evidence and so there be no absolute rule accord to you but what you be ask us now to hold i think be that as a matter of law an expert who opine on something and refuse to provide the source be sufficiently unreliable that it do not constitute substantial evidence be that what you be try to get us to all right you be define meaningful but let us let me pose a hypothetical expert say what this expert say and you get up and say how many of these people have the same condition as my client have and the expert say virtually every one of them how many people do you do research on with respect to this issue i contact about business have you place these kind of individual in the kind of job you have talk about yes a hundred of them whatever do you believe that in that circumstance you could stand here and say that there be not substantial evidence from which the alj could rely upon even if you have not see the underlie record I be give you the best case for them because the good case for you be for her to say well I have never really place anyone with that with those condition i only check one employer but I be extrapolate from that some sort of methodology that really could be questionable those be the two extreme we have be not it all right the potential extreme we have but no one ask any of those question below for us to make a judgment about whether the alj s ruling be reasonable or not but i think you be miss the point which be you would not have need the survey to make the argument you just make you could have question the expert and show the lack of a sufficient basis for their conclusion and then make that argument to the alj what I be try to get at be i understand the need in some situation to actually see the survey but do not you have to lay at least some predicate ground for why that be necessary in your particular case then do not that solve this case because your agency now have in its handbook that every expert have to come prepared to cite the source that they rely upon and to produce the material so if they have make that judgment why should not we make the same judgment that a failure to do so go to the heart of the expert s unreliability do you want to show me where in the handbook that be say so i know so i can follow you the source so they be pick number from the air be not they give the the file before they come to testify on the individual claimant you be worry me that this be in fact what all of the critic be say that these be number pull out of a hat as a person sit there mr yang mr yang it be really I be sorry do it matter who mr yang you seem to in answer justice gorsuch believe that because the alj be the one who say I be not go to order that that that somehow elevate the prior answer into be reliable i mean no expert be the judge in a case correct the judge have to accept the testimony all right so how can an alj accept testimony for which it be block an answer about how the expert come to their conclusion that that be his basic argument which be this testimony be unreliable because i be block from be able to show a basis no i could get on the stand and say anything i want and if the alj stop the other side from give the base for that the record be devoid of a basis for that answer and it be unreliable for that reason that i think be the core of their argument well that be that be fascinate because there be a whole exchange at the beginning of this hearing where the alj ask the attorney to stipulate to the expertise of the expert and the attorney refuse to do so and he say because but not to the expertise and certainly not to the fact that the expertise match the disability at issue in this case do not that shift the burden be not it your burden to prove that those job exist why be it their burden to show the basis for your expert s opinion it be me get up there and just say this be the number believe me ,369.16000000000014,Case pending,"Dec 4, 2018",Michael J.

No, it makes no sense to subtract them unless you never intended to include them. You assume an ambiguity, that the statute can be read in two ways.

2018,"Lamps Plus, Inc. v. Varela",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"But don't you make that determination under state law? I didn't think the FAA in any way undoes state law, unless the basis of the state law is directed only at arbitration, which isn't the case here. Well, that's a standard that's basically dicta because there the parties agree the agreement didn't. So -- I -- I do have one more question for me. You claim there's jurisdiction for you to appeal this case. Let's assume the plaintiff or the Petitioner, or I guess it would be the Respondent here -- either way, that a party who seeks class arbitration is denied class arbitration. Can they appeal directly to us? So what's good for the goose is good for the gander? All right. So we're going to be filled with all of these interim orders denying or granting class arbitration, as the case may be, because each losing party will have the opportunity to come to us and the arbitration won't proceed? The courts aren't staying those cases? They haven't -- Now we're creating a federal common law -- -- something we're loathe to do in virtually every other context? I think we were very clear that it's a matter of contract and state law controls that. That's really interesting. Where does the FAA give us that right? So is your -- I'm sorry. Is your position that the decision below was right on state law? Basically, you're not quarrelling that this contract was ambiguous, that it was susceptible to the meaning Petitioner -- that Respondent gave it, and that under California law, that would encompass this claim because they weren't the drafters? Is your position now that federal common law is superseding state law -- -- on how to interpret a contract? I -- I asked you a different question. In how many of those cases -- in how many of those cases is -- in this case, the Respondents did not ask for a stay, correct? And so the statute seems permissive. It says if a party asks for a stay. But there wasn't a request for one, correct? And in those Ninth Circuit cases, even if there's a request for a stay -- -- they hold -- So it then gives the district court the power to decide what's appealable or not? So why did you let -- So why did you let the court decide that issue? Well, it seems to me -- I'm not quite sure why you did what you did, but it seems to me that that would have been clearly for the arbitrators under the terms of this contract because it's related to -- it -- You know -- -- class action is a procedural process. And, in my mind, that quintessentially is always an arbitrator's question, what -- when you hold the hearings, how you hold them, where. All of those things are typically arbitrator decisions. So it seems to me that under normal circumstances you wouldn't have a court decide that, so I think Justice Gorsuch's earlier point, but here instead you chose the court to make that decision. Well, wait a minute. Why did you not ask for a stay? Yeah, so you -- you -- The problem I have is the following, because it -- it's following up on Justice Alito's question, okay? There are at least two or three California lower courts and at least one court of appeals who have seen contracts almost identical to this -- -- and said, contrary to the lower court, to the lower court here, to the Ninth Circuit, that that language is not enough to have a foothold in the contract under California law, because the words ""the waiver of all lawsuits or other civil legal proceedings,"" you have to submit everything to arbitration, don't say anything about the nature, the procedural nature, of that arbitration. That's been their reasoning. And they look at all of the I's and my claims of this contract and say that shows just a bilateral intent. And so those courts, unlike the court here, is basically saying that the court below misapplied state law. Now are we supposed to give deference to the state court on its interpretation of state law, or are we supposed to check to make sure that they are, in fact, following state law? Well, it is an issue -- -- because, if this contract doesn't speak at all, there's no foothold. My problem with that is arbitration isn't law proceedings by definition. You did have some discovery rules here, but by nature, the discovery rules in arbitration, a procedural issue, are different than a lawsuit. So are notice requirements and interrogatories. Everything's different procedurally. Why are you thinking that class action proceedings are -- are a special proceeding that you're entitled to bring somewhere else? No, it doesn't. No, he's granted that right as a procedural right in the lawsuit. The operative question here is, is he entitled to that in an arbitration? That's a separate -- Class action is not a remedy. To other people, not him.

2018,Tennessee Wine and Spirits Retailers Association v. Blair,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Could I ask you to clarify for me your position? Justice Sutton, in his dissent, basically said, if your legislature came and said we don't want out-of-state wholesalers, distributors, or retailers to be in our chain of distribution, because they're going to take business away from our local enterprises, period, end of story -- are you saying that the state can do that? Are you disagreeing with Justice -- with Judge Sutton? Or do you think that there's an economic protectionism -- protection against what a state can do? The problem is -- Well, except we have a difficulty there, which is you can't look at legislation piecemeal. You have to look at it as a whole. It was written as a whole. It's one paragraph that says two years, plus 10. So it's really 12 years because -- and he said there's no economic justification for a 10-year residency requirement. So what you have to look at is not whether it's two years but whether there's any reason for a 12-year residency requirement. I mean, if he said no to 10, then it's no to 12. But -- but let's go back to my initial question. Yes, it does. And -- and that's a separate question, and you can argue that one back and forth. But my fundamental question is the -- you believe the Twenty-First Amendment permits states to discriminate against out-of-state interests, then does that mean Bacchus, Granholm, all our jurisprudence that has invalidated certain state laws was wrong? Is that -- are you suggesting we should just disavow all those cases and forget them? I know you want to limit it to producers. But that's not the way that Granholm talked about them, talked about this issue, but -- -- you can slice and dice as much as you want, but is it your position that the Twenty-First Amendment makes all of our other jurisprudence wrong? But they could have -- Wholesalers. Bacchus -- Bacchus is -- Well, under your theory -- Yeah, that's the problem. I don't know why, under your theory of the dormant Commerce Clause, if the state can do what it wants within its borders because it's regulating liquor, I don't know why our cases would be right under your theory that they can't put a different tax on different products? Then Ziffrin -- then Ziffrin was wrong? One of the cases you rely on. Because Ziffrin was really the counter to Bacchus, wasn't it? And -- and Ziffrin basically said you can discriminate in terms of taxes basically. So that's where you're wrong because the law then did provide for racial discrimination, and there's nothing in the provision that limits itself to the Commerce Clause. It just says: The transportation or importation into any state, territory, or possession of the United States for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors in violation of the laws thereof is hereby prohibited. I don't actually see in that any reference to the Commerce Clause or to any other limiting principle. Yet we have cases that have found limiting principles. All right. Let me -- let me ask something about that. I do understand that the Twenty-First Amendment was geared towards giving states greater freedom in controlling the distribution and sale of liquor in their jurisdiction. But I'm having a hard time understanding how the residency requirement does when it comes to a person's pre-existing residency. So, yes, we understand that having someone there who's responsible to the community is necessary. That was inherent in the three-tier system. But why is it inherent in the three-tier system that you have to have someone who's only a local do it? There are many states whose three-tier system doesn't require that. They function fairly well. I -- I don't understand the necessity of that. Well, we just -- I -- I agree. But there are some parts of the discrimination part of the -- of the Commerce Clause that we -- today still affect this. You're saying they can't use it to violate the First Amendment. We've said you can't use it to discriminate against products, although nothing in here says you can't do that. I'm -- I'm having a hard time understanding. Explain to me why it's necessary. See, I -- I -- the problem I have is it seems -- I don't think that you would challenge a state -- the state's residency requirement moving forward, meaning that almost all of the states require their wholesalers, distributors, and retailers to be resident in the state. Present. But pretty much you're not challenging that. So now the challenge seems to me why is a pre-registration or pre-licensing residency requirement of the normal length, one or two years, because I think even the dissent below thought the 14 was too -- the 12 was too long, all right, but let's concentrate on the two. Let's do the severability your adversary wants. Why is that two years not reasonable -- -- given the history of what other states have done, et cetera, et cetera? Except for the attorney general may -- may represent the government, but the legislature gave a reason. Let's have -- ",could i ask you to clarify for me your position justice sutton in his dissent basically say if your legislature come and say we do not want out of state wholesaler distributor or retailer to be in our chain of distribution because they be go to take business away from our local enterprise period end of story be you say that the state can do that be you disagree with justice with judge sutton or do you think that there be an economic protectionism protection against what a state can do the problem be well except we have a difficulty there which be you can not look at legislation piecemeal you have to look at it as a whole it be write as a whole it be one paragraph that say two year plus so it be really year because and he say there be no economic justification for a year residency requirement so what you have to look at be not whether it be two year but whether there be any reason for a year residency requirement i mean if he say no to then it be no to but but let us go back to my initial question yes it do and and that be a separate question and you can argue that one back and forth but my fundamental question be the you believe the twenty first amendment permit state to discriminate against out of state interest then do that mean bacchus granholm all our jurisprudence that have invalidate certain state law be wrong be that be you suggest we should just disavow all those case and forget them i know you want to limit it to producer but that be not the way that granholm talk about them talk about this issue but you can slice and dice as much as you want but be it your position that the twenty first amendment make all of our other jurisprudence wrong but they could have wholesaler bacchus bacchus be well under your theory yeah that be the problem i do not know why under your theory of the dormant commerce clause if the state can do what it want within its border because it be regulate liquor i do not know why our case would be right under your theory that they can not put a different tax on different product then ziffrin then ziffrin be wrong one of the case you rely on because ziffrin be really the counter to bacchus be not it and and ziffrin basically say you can discriminate in term of tax basically so that be where you be wrong because the law then do provide for racial discrimination and there be nothing in the provision that limit itself to the commerce clause it just say the transportation or importation into any state territory or possession of the united state for delivery or use therein of intoxicate liquor in violation of the law thereof be hereby prohibit i do not actually see in that any reference to the commerce clause or to any other limiting principle yet we have case that have find limiting principle all right let me let me ask something about that i do understand that the twenty first amendment be gear towards give state great freedom in control the distribution and sale of liquor in their jurisdiction but I be have a hard time understand how the residency requirement do when it come to a person s pre exist residency so yes we understand that have someone there who be responsible to the community be necessary that be inherent in the three tier system but why be it inherent in the three tier system that you have to have someone who be only a local do it there be many state whose three tier system do not require that they function fairly well i i do not understand the necessity of that well we just i i agree but there be some part of the discrimination part of the of the commerce clause that we today still affect this you be say they can not use it to violate the first amendment we have say you can not use it to discriminate against product although nothing in here say you can not do that I be I be have a hard time understanding explain to me why it be necessary see i i the problem i have be it seem i do not think that you would challenge a state the state s residency requirement move forward mean that almost all of the state require their wholesaler distributor and retailer to be resident in the state present but pretty much you be not challenge that so now the challenge seem to me why be a pre registration or pre licensing residency requirement of the normal length one or two year because i think even the dissent below think the be too the be too long all right but let us concentrate on the two let us do the severability your adversary want why be that two year not reasonable give the history of what other state have do et cetera et cetera except for the attorney general may may represent the government but the legislature give a reason let us have ,382.08,Case pending,"Jan 16, 2019",Tennessee Wine and Spirits Retailers Association,"Zackary W.

2018,Sturgeon v. Frost,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I'm sorry, but ANILCA in many places puts statutory duties on the government, on the Park Service. So, for example, the statute expands the Glacier Bay National Monument. It says that the monument shall be managed for the following purposes among others, to protect a segment of the Alsek River fish and wildlife habitats and migration routes and a portion of the Fairweather Range. Or take another example. ANILCA creates the Kobuk Valley National Park, which it says shall be managed for the following purposes: among others, to keep it in an undeveloped state. So the agency has a statutory duty to manage these parks for the purpose of maintaining the Kobuk River, the Alsek River, and other rivers. If the Park Service can't do what you say, any regulation on these rivers, how can the Secretary fulfill the statutory duties and -- under ANILCA, unless it's under its organic powers? You haven't answered my question. Under your theory, the state manages all navigable waters between federal lands or between state lands. And I mean not waters but lands -- -- in terms of the territorial lands. How does the Park Service engage in its statutory obligations if it can't do what you say? There's no public waters. Under your theory, all the waters belong to the state. All right. So what you're saying is that a good portion of the Act with all of the preservations of the rivers that the Act imposes upon the Park Service, it cannot do any of that work? Does it make any difference that a park is designated as a wild and scenic river? That's a quite extreme -- The state doesn't have title -- I don't think you've answered my question. How is the government, the federal government, supposed to fulfill its statutory duties? There are many rivers here that they're given explicit obligations. Your basically saying 103(c) trumps that doesn't make much sense to me. If a statute tells the government do this and at the same time reserves some rights to the state, doesn't the federal government's obligation to do this, the explicit obligation to deal with certain rivers in a particular way, trump any other exemption that you might have? I -- I'm sorry, just that's not true. Many of these rivers are specifically named in the statute. And your position or your co-counsel's position is that all of these rivers belong to the state? Well, we have a problem with whether you can own navigable waters, but that's a different issue. I'm having a hard time accepting your position in this case with your position that the Katie John decisions should be retained. I don't know how we can give different meaning to public lands in two provisions of the same Act. One could -- -- if one defines them the same, but not in accordance with your views, but in accordance with the government's current view, and the Katie law decisions view -- -- then you don't win here. So why isn't an -- all of the references to the government's control of rivers in this Act a similar statement of purpose? Or regulate subsistence living, but you're arguing that the purpose of the statute is reflected in its structure and words. And the structure and words here are giving the government defined statutory duties for any number of rivers within this compound. So it -- I don't see the difference in the logic. Can -- Can I ask the question in reverse? What can't you do? Under your reading of this statute, what sorts of regulations can't you pass? Because, if you can identify a permissible and impermissible, you're giving meaning to this. If you don't, you're basically saying there's no meaning. So am I to -- Can I summarize what I think you said? Are you saying that 103(c) basically, because of the navigational servitude, the other regulations you've pointed to, doesn't permit the government to regulate activities on the territorial lands or -- or on the submerged lands, but it does give it basically plenary authority over navigable waters? So you're basically saying, whatever the regulations were under the Organic Act or even under this Act, and charging you with taking care of certain parks, that the navigable waters are part of that charge? The problem is you don't have title to the water. I mean, you suggest that there are some cases who say effectively it is, but effectively is different than is. Navigable waters are navigable waters. We rarely think of them as someone having title to them, but we do think of them as having interest in them. And if there's two interests, the federal government's and the state's, don't they win? Because, if they have an interest, they have a public interest that, by statute, is being directed. I mean, there are 26 rivers designated as wild and scenic rivers here. There are all sorts of -- I've mentioned this repeatedly -- all sorts of statutory obligations that the government's being given under this particular Act to preserve these waterways in a particular way. So I -- I don't understand. If you don't have title, does this -- at least with respect to navigable waters, do you have any claim whatsoever? ",I be sorry but anilca in many place put statutory duty on the government on the park service so for example the statute expand the glacier bay national monument it say that the monument shall be manage for the following purpose among others to protect a segment of the alsek river fish and wildlife habitat and migration route and a portion of the fairweather range or take another example anilca create the kobuk valley national park which it say shall be manage for the following purpose among others to keep it in an undeveloped state so the agency have a statutory duty to manage these park for the purpose of maintain the kobuk river the alsek river and other river if the park service can not do what you say any regulation on these river how can the secretary fulfill the statutory duty and under anilca unless it be under its organic power you have not answer my question under your theory the state manage all navigable water between federal land or between state land and i mean not water but land in term of the territorial land how do the park service engage in its statutory obligation if it can not do what you say there be no public water under your theory all the water belong to the state all right so what you be say be that a good portion of the act with all of the preservation of the river that the act impose upon the park service it can not do any of that work do it make any difference that a park be designate as a wild and scenic river that be a quite extreme the state do not have title i do not think you have answer my question how be the government the federal government suppose to fulfill its statutory duty there be many river here that they be give explicit obligation your basically say c trump that do not make much sense to me if a statute tell the government do this and at the same time reserve some right to the state do not the federal government s obligation to do this the explicit obligation to deal with certain river in a particular way trump any other exemption that you might have i I be sorry just that be not true many of these river be specifically name in the statute and your position or your co counsel s position be that all of these river belong to the state well we have a problem with whether you can own navigable water but that be a different issue I be have a hard time accept your position in this case with your position that the katie john decision should be retain i do not know how we can give different mean to public land in two provision of the same act one could if one define them the same but not in accordance with your view but in accordance with the government s current view and the katie law decision view then you do not win here so why be not an all of the reference to the government s control of river in this act a similar statement of purpose or regulate subsistence living but you be argue that the purpose of the statute be reflect in its structure and word and the structure and word here be give the government define statutory duty for any number of river within this compound so it i do not see the difference in the logic can can i ask the question in reverse what can not you do under your reading of this statute what sort of regulation can not you pass because if you can identify a permissible and impermissible you be give mean to this if you do not you be basically say there be no meaning so be i to can i summarize what i think you say be you say that c basically because of the navigational servitude the other regulation you have point to do not permit the government to regulate activity on the territorial land or or on the submerged land but it do give it basically plenary authority over navigable water so you be basically say whatever the regulation we be under the organic act or even under this act and charge you with take care of certain park that the navigable water be part of that charge the problem be you do not have title to the water i mean you suggest that there be some case who say effectively it be but effectively be different than be navigable water be navigable water we rarely think of them as someone have title to them but we do think of them as have interest in them and if there be two interest the federal government s and the state s do not they win because if they have an interest they have a public interest that by statute be be direct i mean there be river designate as wild and scenic river here there be all sort of I have mention this repeatedly all sort of statutory obligation that the government s be give under this particular act to preserve these waterway in a particular way so i i do not understand if you do not have title do this at least with respect to navigable water do you have any claim whatsoever ,413.16,Case pending,"Nov 5, 2018",John Sturgeon,"Bert Frost, in His Official Capacity as Alaska Regional Director of the National Park Service, et al.",17-949,"Jun 18, 2018",,113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
