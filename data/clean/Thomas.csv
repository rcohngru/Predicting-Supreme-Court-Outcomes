You say that this is a religious symbol. What is the religion of the Klan? But I think the argument... the reason I ask is so much of the argument is based on the assumption that this cross is a religious symbol. Now, is there testimony to the effect that it is a religious symbol. Well, if it has a... and I don't know what the mix is. Let's say, 50-50, 50 whatever other reasons, and 50 religious, then how does that become a free exercise problem? Well, I mean, it's a problem in this case. Well, now, with that said, what is... what does a burning cross symbolize? So there are some people... as I understand the record, there were some concerns that some of the citizens of Columbus, when they saw that, could actually see fire on that cross. That's right. But doesn't the record suggest, though, that there was some concern that people would see more than the religious symbol in that cross? But that message doesn't implicate the Establishment Clause. Do you think that the political... with respect to the cross, that the political message for the Klan overwhelms the religious free exercise considerations, that if someone... if I said that a member of the Ku Klux Klan is carrying a cross down Pennsyivania Avenue, would the average person, or the reasonable person, think that that, that the Klan is engaged in an exercise of religion, or a political statement? So we're shoe-horning a political case into the religious component of the First Amendment.

Now, did he have options to... was the money given to him, and did he then put it in an IRA, or was it within the terms of the plan? Okay. One other question. Let's say that Isaac, that his wife pre... she passed away in 1979, that he was quite grieved, and did not remarry, and assume that the gift that Justice O'Connor spoke about was made to the kids, or it was passed on as it was in this case, but Isaac did not remarry. What would the children get in those circumstances? Well, let's just... from the plan. That's all I'm interested in. Under this plan, what would they get? No, when he died. Let's say everything is exactly the same as it is now. Except, he doesn't remarry. What about the $150,000? So the $150,000 you treat separately. Let's say that's... we have to assume that went to a bank account or something. Is that accurate? So the lump... there's a difference between the lump sum and the stock as opposed to the survivor's annuity. Mr. Wolfson, I'm sorry to interrupt you. Do you have a better argument for the lump sum than you do for the annuity? But do you have a better argument for the lump sum than the annuity? Well, I think where you're losing me... I'm sorry to interrupt, but where you're losing me is, if he had not remarried, what is there to give away? So what? Suppose he gambled. Suppose he decided to go to the river boats and just feed the slot machines. It would not have increased the estate. Okay, let's say he did not remarry. And he decided to... for the few years he was single, he was so grieved, he was so full of grief that he gambled a lot. Now, what is it in the estate that they get more of? I don't understand... I just don't understand your argument. That he... there is no annuity. The only annuity available is for the survivor benefits. There is no survivor because he never rem rried, so what is it for the children to get? They didn't have any.

1997,Rogers v. United States,108,Clarence Thomas,"--Mr. Rubinstein. Let's go back to page 104 of the joint appendix. I'm having a similar problem, a problem similar to Justice Breyer. It says here at the bottom, what must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt is that the defendant knowingly possessed the item as charged. Now, what was that item, as charged? That's not what we held in Staples. What we held in Staples is that he had to know that the machine gun, or the gun that he had could be converted... had the characteristics of a machine gun. Not that it was a firearm. No, no, the characteristics that make it a machine gun. Well, the item as charged, what I don't understand is that, what must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt is that the defendant knowingly possessed the item as charged. The item as charged was that... is that a 9-inch by 1/3/4 inch silencer? Mr. Nuechterlein, just a couple of clarifications. In the court of appeals' opinion, the court of appeals says, as discussed above the district court, over defense objection, refused to inform the jury that the Government had the burden of showing Rogers knew the item in questions were firearms under the act. In the question presented in this case, in the cert petition, the petitioner says that the trial court, over the objection of the defense counsel, the timely objection of defense counsel, refused to instruct the jury that the Government as an element of the offense charged was required to prove that petitioner knew the item in question was a firearm within the meaning of the statute. Now, does the Government concede that the failure to object that the silencer was a firearm is an error? That the failure to instruct that the silencer was a firearm is an error? That's the error that the court of appeals found. So your answer is, the Government does not concede that the failure to give a particular instruction was in error. That that was-- --No, that's... my question is... this is from the court of appeals opinion, and you... that the... as discussed above, the district court, over defense objection, refused to inform the jury that the Government had the burden of showing Rogers knew the items in question were firearms under the act. With the benefit of the Supreme Court's opinion is Staples, we can now indubitably state that the district court's action effectively omitted the instruction an... from the instruction an essential element of the crime. No, whether Staples requires that there be an instruction that the silencer was a... that he knowingly possessed a firearm under the act. Not a silencer, a firearm. And you think that the court of appeals says that in this opinion? ",mr rubinstein let us go back to page of the joint appendix I be have a similar problem a problem similar to justice breyer it say here at the bottom what must be prove beyond a reasonable doubt be that the defendant knowingly possess the item as charge now what be that item as charge that be not what we hold in staple what we hold in staple be that he have to know that the machine gun or the gun that he have could be convert have the characteristic of a machine gun not that it be a firearm no no the characteristic that make it a machine gun well the item as charge what i do not understand be that what must be prove beyond a reasonable doubt be that the defendant knowingly possess the item as charge the item as charge be that be that a inch by inch silencer mr nuechterlein just a couple of clarification in the court of appeal opinion the court of appeal say as discuss above the district court over defense objection refuse to inform the jury that the government have the burden of show rogers know the item in question we be firearms under the act in the question present in this case in the cert petition the petitioner say that the trial court over the objection of the defense counsel the timely objection of defense counsel refuse to instruct the jury that the government as an element of the offense charge be require to prove that petitioner know the item in question be a firearm within the meaning of the statute now do the government concede that the failure to object that the silencer be a firearm be an error that the failure to instruct that the silencer be a firearm be an error that be the error that the court of appeal find so your answer be the government do not concede that the failure to give a particular instruction be in error that that be no that be my question be this be from the court of appeal opinion and you that the as discuss above the district court over defense objection refuse to inform the jury that the government have the burden of show rogers know the item in question we be firearms under the act with the benefit of the supreme court s opinion be staple we can now indubitably state that the district court s action effectively omit the instruction an from the instruction an essential element of the crime no whether staple require that there be an instruction that the silencer be a that he knowingly possess a firearm under the act not a silencer a firearm and you think that the court of appeal say that in this opinion ,159.91,Rehnquist Court,"Nov 5, 1997",Rogers,United States,96-1279,,"Jan 14, 1998",108.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1

1997,Pennsylvania Department of Corrections v. Yeskey,108,Clarence Thomas,"Just one question. The cases of ramps and some of the fixtures are fairly easy and straightforward cases, but we both know that in the employment context there's such a thing... reasonable accommodation includes reassignment. It also includes redesigning of jobs. Now, would you see... seek in this case a redesigning of the boot camp to accommodate a... an individual who is disabled in some way? Well, if it was necessary. Sort of on the scale of light duty in the post office or something like that. Yes, and... I understand that, but that's... we both know that that's tough. The... you can redesign jobs that fundamentally do the same thing, but with half the efficiency, so we know there's a problem there. Let me ask you one other question. Even though the accommodation may be different or reasonableness may take on a different meaning in the remedial context, the definition, very personalized definition of what is a disability, let's say someone has a disability, of course, of a psychological nature. That would have to be accommodated in prison, right? Well, let's say it's in Pennsylvania in the employment context some... you can prove, this individual can prove that claustrophobia is my disability, and let's say this person has a history of claustrophobia as a disability, and the... as soon as he's sentenced by the judge he says, I have claustrophobia. Now, how do you accommodate that? But we both know it's a little bit more... reasonable accommodation is a bit more difficult than our discussion's been so far. But we know under 504 it's pretty difficult. Okay.

1998,National Aeronautics and Space Administration v. Federal Labor Relations Authority,108,Clarence Thomas,"Mr. Smith, I'd like to revisit with you. You said there is a trend away from or toward Inspector Generals investigating these types of cases. Now, isn't that only a part of the story? Wasn't there a trend some years ago away from internal auditors in agencies? That's right. Well, not all before your time. For the independent regulatory agencies, wasn't that during the '80's? Well, there's a separate Inspector Generals act for the smaller agencies. Wasn't there then an attitude in Congress that the investigation should not be controlled by the agency heads? Well, that was the attitude. The point was, I don't think you can have it both ways. You can't say that the Inspector General is under the agency head when we know that the purpose was to do just the opposite and to get the investigations from under the agency heads. And let me ask you this question. Do you agree that in the old days that the head of the agency could actually direct the auditor's investigation of these matters? Do you agree that the head of the agency cannot direct the investigation by the IG? No, that's not what I'm talking about. No, that's not what I'm talking about. If the IG said, I want to investigate this matter-- --can the agency head say, no, you can't? If the IG said, I want to investigate this matter in this manner, can the agency head say, you cannot? The agency head can tell them that? By what authority? Well, I don't know where you get that authority. I think you... that's... you know, that's... that's an interpretation. Doesn't the... doesn't the IG... let's say the... the... the IG and the agency head were at loggerheads about a matter. To whom would the IG then report this dispute? Isn't it true that the IG has a separate line of communication and separate reporting authority to Congress? And in reality they have separate reporting authority to Congress. If they are at loggerheads with the head of the agency. Do you know of any instance where the agency head has been directed by or the IG has been directed by... an IG has been directed by an agency head to conduct an audit or an investigation in a certain way? No. Earlier you asked... you said that the agency head can direct an investigation. Do you know of any instance in which that has happened? No. Where an agency head has said to an... an IG, this is the manner in which I want you to conduct this investigation. Well, you could be told... the IG can be told anything. I... my question is, can the agency head direct the IG to do what the agency head wants the IG to do or the agency head believes to be the law? Okay. Now, do you have any examples of that? But you would have to agree... I mean, you can't to a specific provision in the IG Act for that. But if the agency head agreed with you that the union representative should be in such an interview and the IG said no, you can't point to any provision authorizing the agency head to direct the IG to include a union representative in such a meeting or interview. No, but if your argument is, if... if this were my chief of staff who was conducting the... the investigation and I said, look, you are to include the union representative, my chief of staff theoretically as the agency representative would have to do that. But I don't think you can point to any authority where if the head of the agency, the head of NASA, says, look, I'm sensitive to this problem and I want the union representative included in this investigation, and if the IG says, buzz off, I don't know where the... the head of NASA would get the authority to force that or... to force that individual, the IG, to include such an individual. And I'd like you to point to me where that authority is. But your argument is that this IG reports to the Administrator, and if the Administrator can't direct the IG to do precisely what you think the IG should be doing, then I don't know how you can say that the IG reports to the Administrator. I bet you the agency head does. [Laughter] ",mr smith I have like to revisit with you you say there be a trend away from or toward inspector general investigate these type of case now be not that only a part of the story be not there a trend some year ago away from internal auditor in agency that be right well not all before your time for the independent regulatory agency be not that during the s well there be a separate inspector general act for the small agency be not there then an attitude in congress that the investigation should not be control by the agency head well that be the attitude the point be i do not think you can have it both way you can not say that the inspector general be under the agency head when we know that the purpose be to do just the opposite and to get the investigation from under the agency head and let me ask you this question do you agree that in the old day that the head of the agency could actually direct the auditor s investigation of these matter do you agree that the head of the agency can not direct the investigation by the ig no that be not what I be talk about no that be not what I be talk about if the ig say i want to investigate this matter can the agency head say no you can not if the ig say i want to investigate this matter in this manner can the agency head say you can not the agency head can tell them that by what authority well i do not know where you get that authority i think you that be you know that be that be an interpretation do not the do not the ig let us say the the the ig and the agency head we be at loggerhead about a matter to whom would the ig then report this dispute be not it true that the ig have a separate line of communication and separate reporting authority to congress and in reality they have separate reporting authority to congress if they be at loggerhead with the head of the agency do you know of any instance where the agency head have be direct by or the ig have be direct by an ig have be direct by an agency head to conduct an audit or an investigation in a certain way no earlier you ask you say that the agency head can direct an investigation do you know of any instance in which that have happen no where an agency head have say to an an ig this be the manner in which i want you to conduct this investigation well you could be tell the ig can be tell anything i my question be can the agency head direct the ig to do what the agency head want the ig to do or the agency head believe to be the law okay now do you have any example of that but you would have to agree i mean you can not to a specific provision in the ig act for that but if the agency head agree with you that the union representative should be in such an interview and the ig say no you can not point to any provision authorize the agency head to direct the ig to include a union representative in such a meeting or interview no but if your argument be if if this we be my chief of staff who be conduct the the investigation and i say look you be to include the union representative my chief of staff theoretically as the agency representative would have to do that but i do not think you can point to any authority where if the head of the agency the head of nasa say look I be sensitive to this problem and i want the union representative include in this investigation and if the ig say buzz off i do not know where the the head of nasa would get the authority to force that or to force that individual the ig to include such an individual and I would like you to point to me where that authority be but your argument be that this ig report to the administrator and if the administrator can not direct the ig to do precisely what you think the ig should be do then i do not know how you can say that the ig report to the administrator i bet you the agency head do laughter ,251.3,Rehnquist Court,"Mar 23, 1999",National Aeronautics and Space Administration,Federal Labor Relations Authority,98-369,,"Jun 17, 1999",108.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1

Let's assume that a candidate raises large portions of money to run political ads-- --on television, radio, newspapers, et cetera, that you think that that raising of money has the potential of corrupting the political process, an argument that you've made for limiting the contributions. Can you now simply say that because money corrupts, we are going to limit the amount of money that can be charged by these organizations to run the political ads, not their editorials, not their news articles, but the amount they charge for the ads themselves? Why? What's the distinction? What's the difference between limiting the amount that I can contribute to my candidate, and limiting the amount that an organization charges to run an ad of mine? Whose speech? It's my ad. Yes. Can be charged by the newspaper organizations. I have an ad. I want to run it 200 times. It's... the news organization wants to charge me 100 dollars per showing. Can you limit it to 50 dollars per showing? No, I'm asking, do you... using your rationale, would that pass First Amendment muster?

2015,Voisine v. United States,108,Clarence Thomas,"Ms. Eisenstein, one question. Can you give me -- this is a misdemeanor violation. It suspends a constitutional right. Can you give me another area where a misdemeanor violation suspends a constitutional right? Well, I'm -- I'm looking at the -- you're saying that recklessness is sufficient to trigger a violation -- misdemeanor violation of domestic conduct that results in a lifetime ban on possession of a gun, which, at least as of now, is still a constitutional right. Can you think of another constitutional right that can be suspended based upon a misdemeanor violation of a State law? I'm -- this is a -- how long is this suspension of the right to own a firearm? Okay. So can you think of a First Amendment suspension or a suspension of a First Amendment right that is permanent? So in each of these cases had -- did any of the defendants, or in this case Petitioners, use a weapon against a family member? So that the -- again, the suspension is not directly related to the use of the weapon. It is a suspension that is actually indirectly related or actually unrelated. It's just a family member's involved in a misdemeanor violation; therefore, a constitutional right is suspended. Even if that -- if even if that violence is unrelated to the use -- the possession of a gun? Well, let's -- let's say that a publisher is reckless about the use of children, and what could be considered indecent displays and that that triggers a violation of, say, a hypothetical law against the use of children in these ads, and let's say it's a misdemeanor violation. Could you suspend that publisher's right to ever publish again? So how is that different from suspending your Second Amendment right? Would you have a better case if this were a gun crime? ",ms eisenstein one question can you give me this be a misdemeanor violation it suspend a constitutional right can you give me another area where a misdemeanor violation suspend a constitutional right well I be I be look at the you be say that recklessness be sufficient to trigger a violation misdemeanor violation of domestic conduct that result in a lifetime ban on possession of a gun which at least as of now be still a constitutional right can you think of another constitutional right that can be suspend base upon a misdemeanor violation of a state law I be this be a how long be this suspension of the right to own a firearm okay so can you think of a first amendment suspension or a suspension of a first amendment right that be permanent so in each of these case have do any of the defendant or in this case petitioner use a weapon against a family member so that the again the suspension be not directly relate to the use of the weapon it be a suspension that be actually indirectly related or actually unrelated it be just a family member s involve in a misdemeanor violation therefore a constitutional right be suspend even if that if even if that violence be unrelated to the use the possession of a gun well let us let us say that a publisher be reckless about the use of child and what could be consider indecent display and that that trigger a violation of say a hypothetical law against the use of child in these ad and let us say it be a misdemeanor violation could you suspend that publisher s right to ever publish again so how be that different from suspend your second amendment right would you have a good case if this we be a gun crime ,151.2,Roberts Court,"Feb 29, 2016","Stephen Voisine, et al.",United States,14-10154,"Oct 30, 2015","Jun 27, 2016",108.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
