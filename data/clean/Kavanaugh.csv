But is there a more particular harm that comes from accepting it at an embassy? I understand that, but I'm more -- As a practical matter, as a practical matter, is that hard to accomplish? In other words, the system going forward, if we were to say you can't do it at embassies, is there a problem going under that mechanism? Are you aware of any problems trying to effectuate service generally under (a)(4)? It could, but are -- Does it -- But you're saying -- But the point -- Counsel, the point -- the point you're making is it's not a big deal to allow service at an embassy, even though the United States objects and even though, as Justice Breyer points out, no other country appears to allow that. And -- and my response in addition to that is, is it really a big deal to, from your perspective going forward, I know about this case, but going forward as a system, to go through the (a)(4) mechanism rather than (a)(3) at -- at an embassy?

2018,United States v. Stitt,116,Brett M. Kavanaugh,"But I notice if -- if you're convicted three times of burglary for burglarizing an RV, you're on notice, presumably, if you look at the federal statutes and you then possess a firearm, that -- that those burglaries were of a structure, as Taylor said. I don't understand the notice point. But you would look at Taylor and you'd see it's citing the model -- Taylor's the case, right, focus on Taylor. It's a long time ago. It talks about other structures. It doesn't limit it to the '84 definition, cites the Model Penal Code, cites the LaFave Treatise, points out all the state statutes, and I think if you're convicted three separate times of breaking into an RV and look at that, those sources, you would be on some notice that you shouldn't be possessing a firearm under federal law. But Taylor -- Taylor does not do that, though, when it says other -- or other structures. Quite clearly, Taylor departs from the '84 statute in what it describes there, don't you agree, when it says ""or other structures""? Because the '84 Act only says building. And one of the -- I'm sorry to interrupt. And one of the reasons it departed, as I read the opinion, which is quite thorough, is it did a full excavation of the Model Penal Code, of the treatises, of the state statutes, and said the '84 definition does not reflect common understanding, as Judge Sutton described in detail in his opinion, of the common understanding at the time of what burglary entailed. What are you -- what are you -- What are you -- what are you basing that assertion on? Are these assertions about RVs you're -- Yes. But isn't that what the Model Penal Code had and some states already have? In other words, this is not something that would be created now. I understand, but that's always going to be the case that there will be some slight differences, right? I mean -- And you don't think ""adapted"" has a firm grounding, even though it's been around in most state statutes for -- or many state statutes?

2018,Culbertson v. Berryhill,116,Brett M. Kavanaugh,"But most of the claimants are, of course -- do not have much money, and the statute, as Justice Ginsburg says, puts a 25 percent cap on what -- on how it's going to -- the pool, I guess, is the -- from which it's going to be paid by the agency. Doesn't that suggest that Congress thought that there would be an aggregate cap because, A, there is the pool cap, and then, as Justice Sotomayor says, we don't expect lawyers to go after claimants who, by definition, often can't work and often don't have much money? (a)(4), I thought, established a 25 percent cap on the pool, the statute itself. You said it didn't come from the statute. Maybe I'm misreading something. Well, it seems very clear. It says 25 percent. But that -- that pool established under (a)(4) is the only pool, that Justice Ginsburg has been referencing, that's the only pool, correct? That's capped, the pool is capped by statute at 25 percent? The regulations interpreting that do cap the pool then at 25 percent as well? A different argument, but -- Right. Right. I understand that. And it comes ultimately from an interpretation of the statute. Maybe you're saying it's not mandated by the statute. Right, that's what I mean by saying it's not -- maybe it's not mandated by the statute, is your point. But we're told by the amicus brief of the disability attorneys that that almost never happens. That they try to get the money directly from the client. Now maybe that's not correct, but that's what -- Right. You -- you obviously have a good textual argument. I think the point is your brief then goes to great lengths to say don't worry about taking 50 percent from disability claimants because district courts won't allow that under the reasonableness prong. And the -- the amicus brief of disability attorneys say don't worry about that seemingly extreme 50 percent fee because that never really happens in practice. Both of which suggest that this system was not designed to be one where you're getting 50 percent. You still have a strong textual argument. I'm not -- Right. I understand -- I understand that. Well, what's your definition of ""smaller"" versus ""more substantial"" that you used in response to Justice Kagan's question? The money's coming right out of the claimant's pocket. Right. Right. It comes right out of the claimant's pocket, and it -- and it's unusual to have a 50 percent chunk out of a claimant's -- out of a party's pocket. Yeah, I said unusual, yeah. Well, it's low stakes for the attorney, but it's high stakes for the claimant. That's -- that's where -- I'm sorry to belabor this, but that's where the amicus briefs of the disabled -- disability attorneys comes in because they say they usually agree not to take more than 25 percent. So I'm not sure how your point about the incentive structure actually fits what's going on in those areas -- -- where there's not a cap. Exactly. So you don't need 50 percent to incentivize. Congress used the phrase ""in the aggregate"" in one place that they rely on as well as part of the textual argument, which is the title -- the subchapter, the 2 and the 16 benefits they use ""in the aggregate"" there and don't use it here. Do you have a -- It sounds like you're saying they didn't -- Congress didn't think through -- -- in its language the exact situation on the ground. But I don't know what we're supposed to necessarily do with that. I mean, it seems -- to support your point, it seems almost absurd that Congress would have wanted litigation or actions by disability attorneys against disability claimants. That -- -- that said, the ""in the aggregate"" is missing and the text is a problem, as -- as you acknowledge.

Doesn't commercial exploit -- exploitation also undergird the bar? If that was a -- -- if that was a clarification, it was a terrible clarification because there were a lot of efforts, as you well know, to actually change the ""on sale"" language, and those all failed. You don't think it would have been easier to just change it directly, as many members of Congress tried to do repeatedly and failed? On -- on the first part of what you just said as to what the law was, the amicus brief, the Lemley amicus brief says the law has always treated secret sales and uses as prior art. Are you disagreeing with that? You -- Go ahead. You -- you mentioned the legislative history, but, here, isn't this a classic example of trying to snatch victory from defeat in some of the legislative statements? In other words, there was this law before, as Justice Kagan mentions, a huge effort to change it, lots of proposals to change it. They all fail, and then a couple statements said on the floor on which you're relying. I -- I think the legislative history, read as a whole, goes exactly contrary. What's wrong with thinking that way? But given your position -- I'm -- I'm sorry.

But -- but it's very simple, I think you're agreeing -- -- for the court when they get an appeal, so to pick up Justice Ginsburg's point, if the appeal is reinstated, you get the appeal, well, most issues are probably going to be within the scope of the waiver and then there might be, in some cases, something outside the scope of the waiver. Oftentimes those are not meritorious, of course, and are quickly dealt with. Sometimes they are, though. It seems pretty simple for most appellate courts to deal with that, and I'm not sure there's any evidence of a problem. And if there's not evidence of a problem, why complicate the law, as Justice Breyer says? But -- but -- I'm sorry to interrupt, but I think you acknowledged that the appeal waiver gives up the appeal except in certain limited circumstances. And that goes to my point earlier.

2018,"Return Mail, Inc. v. United States Postal Service",116,Brett M. Kavanaugh,"I was -- I was trying to figure out the difference between ex parte reexamination and these review procedures from your perspective, and I gather that the difference is that the PTO will be the final word within the executive branch if the ex parte reexamination procedure were the only avenue, whereas the Postal Service could seek judicial review against the office if dissatisfied, if the government's position prevailed? Is that the difference in the two review proceedings? That's -- that's the difference that Justice Gorsuch is identifying. You have agency versus agency in federal court. And, again, not unprecedented, but unusual. And why should we go down that road when there's ex parte reexamination process available? And why should we think that Congress wanted us to go down that road when they didn't put the estoppel protection in the -- in the -- at the back end? And you acknowledge that's unusual? And you acknowledge also, I think, that ex parte reexamination is a process available to the Postal Service in this instance to ask the PTO to engage in? Well, can't -- can't the -- I'm sorry to interrupt. Can't the executive branch agencies always communicate with one another? Well, why is that? Under Article II, I would think all components of the executive branch always are able to communicate with one another absent some rule to the contrary that Congress might try to insert. I think the -- Go ahead. But who deleted that, though? That -- that wasn't deleted by Congress, was it? It was the reviser who did that, right? Congress didn't do that? When you take a step back here and think about this case, there are provisions that specifically give the government the same rights as persons, 207 and other provisions in this statute. We don't have them here, obviously. That's what raises the question. So, as Justice Sotomayor says, we have the presumption that the government is not a person. And then we look at the context. And you've said the context supports you. But there are contextual points that seem to cut the other way. And just to summarize them, you still have ex parte reexamination available, so it's not as if Congress would have thought the government's cut out entirely. If your position wins, you have the anomaly, which can be overcome, but it is an anomaly of government against government lawsuits in federal court. And, third, even though you're trying to make the best of it, the estoppel would be very different and not part of the bargain that seems to have been part of what Congress put in place here in terms of the system. So those are all contextual points that actually cut against you, it seems to me, where your burden, because we start from the baseline of the government's not a person, is you need the context to strongly support you.

2018,Obduskey v. McCarthy & Holthus LLP,116,Brett M. Kavanaugh,"But it's -- -- it's only expanding it for purposes of 1692f(6). That's the -- that means that it's something less than that, other than 1692f(6). At least that's the most natural or a natural way to read it. Your -- your point there, though, depends, right, on reading that language as referring to the repo guy, right? But then, when you turn to f(6), is that really just limited to the repo situation? The point being the language of f(6) seems a lot broader than just the repo situation, so then, when you go back to a, it seems odd to think that that's just limited to the repo situation, if I understand the interaction of the two provisions correctly. f(6) also describes non-judicial foreclosures. Right? f(6) does describe, by its terms, non-judicial foreclosures? You're trying to explain why this third sentence is in there -- and I understand that -- and then drawing the distinction between repo and non-judicial foreclosures. But correct me if I'm wrong about this: The history of how this came about was there was debate about whether those who enforce security interests would be covered under debt collection or -- debt collector or not. There were two polar positions, yes and no. And what Congress ended up with was something in between. Is that correct? And the something in between, though, it's hard to just read that in between language as repo and not non-judicial foreclosure. That's the heart of it for me. Well, that's true, but it's inherently communicating a message that you need to repay the debt or you're going to lose the house, as Justice Kagan says. You -- you referred earlier to common sense. Well, common sense tells you this is an effort to have you repay the debt. Why not? Why not? Even if the express words aren't there, everyone who gets something like that, who has the money, and wants to, will understand this is a -- this is a letter seeking to get you to repay. Exactly. The animating purpose is to tell you you need to pay or you're going to lose your house. Is it an either/or really? I mean, it can't be a both/and? But you're -- You are arguing, I think, that even if I disagree with you, we disagree with you on the first sentence, you win because of the third sentence, right? And on the third sentence, I guess the -- the responsive argument is that's an odd way for Congress to have excluded those who enforce security interests from the broad definition of debt collectors and the repo example you heard. Can you respond to that? On the third sentence, I think what you're saying, but tell me if I'm wrong, is that even if we disagree with you on the first sentence, a necessary premise of the third sentence is that Congress, notwithstanding the broad language of the first sentence, must have thought that enforcement of security interests should be distinct from debt collection?

But the precedent on point interprets -- says that time lost is part of services rendered or services performed in the context of the Social Security Act. So why not adhere to that same interpretation in this context at this point? Well, it's because the time allocation was changed. Yes. Yes. I understand that. But it changed -- you didn't need the language anymore, is -- is the argument, right? The ""time lost"" language anymore -- because the -- the allocation had changed? At least that's the argument. I thought a key move in the Eighth Circuit decision was interpreting Nierotko, and then it said we recently determined that that definition can't be imported into the RRTA because the FICA tax is payment for employment, which is defined broadly. But, in fact, Nierotko does go to services performed, which is equivalent, the argument is, to services rendered. So how do you respond to that part when you rely on the Eighth Circuit so specifically? That sentence jumps out at me. That's not what they were relying on. ",your oppose counsel argue that nierotko be discredit that that case do not follow the text we should not follow that methodology here can you respond to that that be their argument the court court of appeal rely heavily on the fact that congress in and take out the reference to payment for time lose but a lot of these a lot of these kind of argument we be make in nierotko and the court reject those in the admittedly in the context of the social security act but why not follow the same interpretation here the cleveland indian be about the allocation time period it be not about the main holding of nierotko in term of how it depart from nierotko be that true but the precedent on point interprets say that time lose be part of service render or service perform in the context of the social security act so why not adhere to that same interpretation in this context at this point well it be because the time allocation be change yes yes i understand that but it change you do not need the language anymore be be the argument right the time lose language anymore because the the allocation have change at least that be the argument i think a key move in the eighth circuit decision be interpret nierotko and then it say we recently determine that that definition can not be import into the rrta because the fica tax be payment for employment which be define broadly but in fact nierotko do go to service perform which be equivalent the argument be to service render so how do you respond to that part when you rely on the eighth circuit so specifically that sentence jump out at me that be not what they we be rely on ,100.76,Case pending,"Nov 6, 2018",BNSF Railway Company,Michael D.

2018,Nieves v. Bartlett,116,Brett M. Kavanaugh,"You -- you base that in part on the practical and policy concerns that you started with, that you raise, and Justice Alito also points out, but the Ninth Circuit has had experience for a number of years with a rule that has allowed suits like this to proceed, and, at least based on the briefing, it doesn't show any massive problem, or correct me if I'm wrong about that. Well, why wouldn't -- explain to me on the qualified immunity -- Justice Sotomayor had raised that too -- why -- why doesn't that solve the issue? Right. But the bottom line point is the Ninth Circuit, it's been a number of years now, has had the rule contrary, and -- -- I would have expected, if there were the problems that you articulate, and I understand why you articulate them, and maybe they will come about as a result of a decision from this Court in more numbers, but there hasn't been a huge problem. Well, that's not -- But you said that an officer merely needs to enforce the law. But the problem, I think, is that, in a lot of interactions that lead to an arrest, there's going to be something critical said, potentially, of the police before the arrest is made. Common sense, common understanding tells us that, that people say things critical in a hot situation, right? And so all of those cases, if it's more than rude and offensive, but rude and offensive with something critical of the police, will go to a jury. Why not? Why not? I understand obnoxious, but obnoxious -- I'm sorry to interrupt -- obnoxious with something critical or skeptical of the police, which leads to the claim that I was arrested because I expressed my view of the police. Why do the damages -- Why? But, theoretically, the person, even if they are arrested, prosecuted, and convicted, could say I never would have been arrested in the first place but for the retaliatory motive. Is that correct or not? The person in your example who is arrested, then prosecuted, and convicted, you said that claim would never go forward. And I'm not understanding, at least theoretically, why that is so, because the person would say: I never would have been arrested in the first place, and everything that followed would never have occurred either, but for the retaliatory motive of the officer. You -- you also said earlier that this Ninth Circuit experience on summary judgment had shown that this was not a huge problem, which I think is a -- a good point for you, but, as Justice Alito pointed out, hasn't the Ninth Circuit watered down the summary judgment standard in some ways to achieve that result? The Congress argument -- the Congress argument can cut both ways, of course. If we were to follow the Hartman analogy here and to follow what the other side says is the common law, Congress could always change the law to expand. So I'm not sure that gets you that far. Well, the starting point is precedent, what the statute says and what -- the precedent says we look at the common law. So we have two strands of precedent to look at. One, look at the common law analogies, and the other is just Hartman itself. And to do both those strands of precedent, I think you're about to respond to those, but I would like you to. ",you you base that in part on the practical and policy concern that you start with that you raise and justice alito also point out but the ninth circuit have have experience for a number of year with a rule that have allow suit like this to proceed and at least base on the briefing it do not show any massive problem or correct me if I be wrong about that well why would not explain to me on the qualified immunity justice sotomayor have raise that too why why do not that solve the issue right but the bottom line point be the ninth circuit it be be a number of year now have have the rule contrary and i would have expect if there we be the problem that you articulate and i understand why you articulate them and maybe they will come about as a result of a decision from this court in more number but there have not be a huge problem well that be not but you say that an officer merely need to enforce the law but the problem i think be that in a lot of interaction that lead to an arrest there be go to be something critical say potentially of the police before the arrest be make common sense common understanding tell us that that people say thing critical in a hot situation right and so all of those case if it be more than rude and offensive but rude and offensive with something critical of the police will go to a jury why not why not i understand obnoxious but obnoxious I be sorry to interrupt obnoxious with something critical or skeptical of the police which lead to the claim that i be arrest because i express my view of the police why do the damage why but theoretically the person even if they be arrest prosecute and convict could say i never would have be arrest in the first place but for the retaliatory motive be that correct or not the person in your example who be arrest then prosecute and convict you say that claim would never go forward and I be not understanding at least theoretically why that be so because the person would say i never would have be arrest in the first place and everything that follow would never have occur either but for the retaliatory motive of the officer you you also say early that this ninth circuit experience on summary judgment have show that this be not a huge problem which i think be a a good point for you but as justice alito point out have not the ninth circuit water down the summary judgment standard in some way to achieve that result the congress argument the congress argument can cut both way of course if we we be to follow the hartman analogy here and to follow what the other side say be the common law congress could always change the law to expand so I be not sure that get you that far well the starting point be precedent what the statute say and what the precedent say we look at the common law so we have two strand of precedent to look at one look at the common law analogy and the other be just hartman itself and to do both those strand of precedent i think you be about to respond to those but i would like you to ,186.36,Case pending,"Nov 26, 2018","Luis A.

2018,Thacker v. Tennessee Valley Authority,116,Brett M. Kavanaugh,"Part of the problem is figuring out what Burr means, to my problem at least. And you said there's a big difference between Burr and the discretionary-function exception. How would you articulate that big difference? Well, that doesn't tell me what the exception means, though. That just describes the situation. What about -- what about the second -- I'm sorry to interrupt, the second prong, though, grave interference? How do you think about that? And are you -- just so I understand your argument here, are you asking us to simply hold that the right test is Burr, instead of discretionary function, and then to remand for application of Burr in the first instance by the court of appeals? What's the maximum? Yeah. But it -- But it's -- One way to look at this case is that the discretionary-function exemption does not apply because it's not statutorily provided, but, nonetheless, Burr applies in that Burr sets up what seems to me on its face to be a higher bar or a more narrower exception than the discretionary-function exception because it uses terms like ""grave interference"" with governmental function. What is wrong with looking at the case that way? Which would leave figuring out exactly what Burr means either to the court of appeals or future elaboration. But, if we conclude that you don't have this discretionary-function exception because it's not provided in the statute, we're left with Burr, right? I know -- I know you're fighting the premise of the ""if"" clause, but if we conclude that, then you're left with Burr. And how do you think Burr should be applied? Right. So -- so you don't do it case by case. You say to not have a discretionary-function exception would cause a grave interference with governmental function? But the -- you're trying to fold the discretionary-function exception into the second part of Burr. But is it really the case -- I guess one response would be is it really the case that you need this broad discretionary-function exception in all these kinds of hypothetical cases that have been raised in order to avoid a grave interference for the governmental function, which seems like a high bar set forth in Burr?

It's got a lot of specific details on very minute things, and this issue which you say rightly is so important, but then somehow was not mentioned in the text of the Constitution. What do you do with Federalist 81, which said that it was inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an individual without its consent and said that would remain with the states? That was Hamilton speaking in Federalist 81, reflecting a notion that it's inherent to the nature of sovereignty. Is that incorrect? Just on the stare decisis question -- -- wouldn't -- wouldn't it be relevant, though, that the case law that's developed subsequent to Nevada versus Hall seems quite inconsistent with the principles in the majority opinion and more consistent with the principles in Justice Rehnquist's dissent and the series of cases that you describe? In other words, if we were five years after Nevada v. Hall being asked to overrule it, that might have been a harder hill to climb, but now that you have all these other cases, that might leave Nevada versus Hall seeming an outlier. How do you respond to that argument? That -- that's often -- But then the question is how we figure out what the compelling reason is, and that's very difficult. And you say nothing has changed. That's true in a lot of cases where the Court has nonetheless overruled a prior decision. And so how are we supposed to think about it?

How to apply that to a particular case is hard, but what -- what I just said in terms of egregiously wrong, severe practical consequences, no real reliance, is that enough in your view to overrule?

2018,Herrera v. Wyoming,116,Brett M. Kavanaugh,"But in that -- in that decision, we did not overrule Race Horse. We said that Race Horse meant that statehood did not automatically terminate the prior treaty right, automatically, but that certain language in the Race Horse treaty was still sufficient to terminate the treaty right. And the language in the Race Horse treaty is the exact same language at issue in this treaty. What's -- so why shouldn't we have the same result here that we had in Race Horse, and that's the part of Race Horse that is preserved on page 207 by Mille Lacs? But -- but we -- sorry to interrupt. We concluded that it was a question of congressional intent, whether the treaty right was terminated by statehood, and we concluded that the language, the right to hunt on unoccupied lands of the United States, was the relevant treaty language, was terminated by Wyoming's statehood, correct? And that's preserved, explicitly preserved, on page 207 of the Mille Lacs opinion. That part is not overruled. And my question is, if that part of Race Horse was not overruled but was explicitly preserved and, in fact, distinguished from the Chippewa treaty, how can we in this case not apply the same result that was applied in Race Horse, with the exact same treaty language? Which part of the reasoning is wrong there? But -- but we said that there were -- we said unlike the treaty at issue in Race Horse, right, and then we said there was a clearly contemplated event in Race Horse, unlike in -- in the Mille Lacs treaty -- -- and the clearly contemplated event was the language said hunting on the unoccupied lands of the United States, that that was terminated by statehood, right? Do you think -- -- Race Horse is overruled or not, the result in Race Horse? You think it's still good law as to the tribe at issue in Race Horse? What's different about the Crow treaty, which is 1868, and the Shoshone treaty, 1868, in terms of the negotiations or the intent? The language is exactly the same. So what's different about the intent? These two treaties? But you haven't pointed to anything really specific. My concern just is -- is just that if we end up with agreeing with you on the merits, we'll have a result that the same treaty language creates two different results, one for the Shoshone ends at statehood, the treaty right, and the other does not for this, the Crow, even though it's the exact same treaty language. And I'd like, if we're going to reach that result, to be able to point to something. And what is that something? But that would have been -- sorry to interrupt. That would have been a reason on page 207 to say the Race Horse decision is gone. And that's not what we said. We distinguished the treaty language. And maybe we should have said it's gone, but we didn't. The oddity is that, as Justice Kagan says, in Mille Lacs, we say that the holding of Race Horse or the reasoning that statehood automatically terminates treaty rights for off-reservation activity, that's no longer good, and then, on the alternative holding, as we characterized it from Rate -- Race Horse, we say that language, the precar -- temporary and precarious, that language is also no good. Right? Even on the alternative holding, it's not as if the Court in Mille Lacs said: Oh, everything from Race Horse is good on the alternative holding. It either ditched it or recharacterized it or something. How would you make sense of what the rule is that's preserved by Mille Lacs? Is that it? (Laughter.) You were -- you sound like you were mid-sentence to me, but -- (Laughter.) Can I ask about the practical consequences of the decision? Because, as Justice Gorsuch said to the opposing counsel, there is still preserved in the cases a right in the state to regulate in the interest of conservation. Doesn't that mitigate and maybe solve the concern that you talked about with the state existing forever and the tribe existing forever? The way they can coexist, our case law says, is the state still retains a right to regulate in the interest of conservation. Why isn't that good -- good enough? But is it just a timing issue then, because -- or is there some gap between what you want to regulate and what you can regulate under the conservation interest? Okay. What -- what -- give me some examples so we can understand the practical consequences. But, if safety were added, as Justice Breyer said, that solves the primary problem you identified, right? ",but in that in that decision we do not overrule race horse we say that race horse mean that statehood do not automatically terminate the prior treaty right automatically but that certain language in the race horse treaty be still sufficient to terminate the treaty right and the language in the race horse treaty be the exact same language at issue in this treaty what be so why should not we have the same result here that we have in race horse and that be the part of race horse that be preserve on page by mille lac but but we sorry to interrupt we conclude that it be a question of congressional intent whether the treaty right be terminate by statehood and we conclude that the language the right to hunt on unoccupied land of the united state be the relevant treaty language be terminate by wyoming s statehood correct and that be preserve explicitly preserve on page of the mille lacs opinion that part be not overrule and my question be if that part of race horse be not overrule but be explicitly preserve and in fact distinguish from the chippewa treaty how can we in this case not apply the same result that be apply in race horse with the exact same treaty language which part of the reasoning be wrong there but but we say that there we be we say unlike the treaty at issue in race horse right and then we say there be a clearly contemplated event in race horse unlike in in the mille lac treaty and the clearly contemplated event be the language say hunt on the unoccupied land of the united state that that be terminate by statehood right do you think race horse be overrule or not the result in race horse you think it be still good law as to the tribe at issue in race horse what be different about the crow treaty which be and the shoshone treaty in term of the negotiation or the intent the language be exactly the same so what be different about the intent these two treaty but you have not point to anything really specific my concern just be be just that if we end up with agree with you on the merit we will have a result that the same treaty language create two different result one for the shoshone end at statehood the treaty right and the other do not for this the crow even though it be the exact same treaty language and I would like if we be go to reach that result to be able to point to something and what be that something but that would have be sorry to interrupt that would have be a reason on page to say the race horse decision be go and that be not what we say we distinguish the treaty language and maybe we should have say it be go but we do not the oddity be that as justice kagan say in mille lac we say that the holding of race horse or the reasoning that statehood automatically terminate treaty right for off reservation activity that be no longer good and then on the alternative holding as we characterize it from rate race horse we say that language the precar temporary and precarious that language be also no good right even on the alternative holding it be not as if the court in mille lac say oh everything from race horse be good on the alternative holding it either ditch it or recharacterized it or something how would you make sense of what the rule be that be preserve by mille lac be that it laughter you we be you sound like you we be mid sentence to me but laughter can i ask about the practical consequence of the decision because as justice gorsuch say to the oppose counsel there be still preserve in the case a right in the state to regulate in the interest of conservation do not that mitigate and maybe solve the concern that you talk about with the state exist forever and the tribe exist forever the way they can coexist our case law say be the state still retain a right to regulate in the interest of conservation why be not that good good enough but be it just a timing issue then because or be there some gap between what you want to regulate and what you can regulate under the conservation interest okay what what give me some example so we can understand the practical consequence but if safety we be added as justice breyer say that solve the primary problem you identify right ,281.72,Case pending,"Jan 8, 2019",Clayvin Herrera,Wyoming,17-532,"Jun 28, 2018",,116.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

Too -- too late as a practical matter. What -- what -- Picking up on Justice Kagan's question at the beginning, is the exception for a motion for reconsideration that's filed within 14 days, is that equitable, or what is that exception? Well, it's not written in the rules. If it's not written in the rules, doesn't it have to be characterized as equitable? I'm still not understanding where that comes from, and -- and I'm also not understanding what sense that makes, really, because, if you filed a timely motion for reconsideration, you have filed a timely motion for reconsideration. It shouldn't be circumscribed based on some other rule that has nothing to do with motions for reconsideration. What's wrong with that thinking? You read -- just to clarify, you read -- you read Rule 54 to apply to appeals not just as of right? Can I just ask on the Rule 59 question, again, suppose a local rule gave you 45 days for a motion for reconsideration, but Rule 59 has the 28-day. What's your position on that? Don't the local rules of many courts then miss -- also mislead counsel because the local rules of many courts would have motions for reconsideration that could be filed within periods longer than 14 days? Under your position, all the district court did here was identify a date that was longer than 14 days. The local rule for motions for reconsideration, the local rules of many courts similarly identify a date that's longer than 14 days for motions for reconsideration. How would you distinguish what happened here from a local rule that's longer than 14 days? How would you distinguish a local rule that has a date longer than 14 days, a period longer than 14 days in which you can file a motion for reconsideration? And the Rule 59 argument, just to reiterate, depends on your Rule 54 interpretation, correct? You could have the same confusion of a local rule that gives longer than 28 days, for example, the local rule here for motion for reconsideration, but then you're not within the 28 days of Rule 59, right? What do you do with a local rule that has no time limit, as the one here in a motion for reconsideration, a motion is filed a year later or something like that? There's nothing misleading about that, I guess is the point here, because the local rule had no time, correct, for a motion for reconsideration? The district court set a time for a motion for reconsideration. There's nothing misleading at all about that. What's misleading, I guess, is, in context, when you roll in Rule 23(f), which the district court said nothing about, correct? I mean, I just don't think it's fair to say the district court misled here. I don't even think it falls into that box necessarily.

But how are we going to tell that in most cases? Justice Kagan's question about two state laws are going to be treated differently based on our inquiry or the federal court's inquiry into the subjective motive seems very odd. The thing that concerns me about this is, how is this going to work? And -- and one way would be, as Justice Sotomayor said, subjective motivations depositions. You rightly say, I think, that that's not what you're looking for. So what's -- what is it? You ask whether the state can articulate a legitimate non-safety rationale, that's -- that's a possible answer. But that's too low, I think you're going to say. But then what do -- what -- what is the answer, for something workable that makes sense here? That's what -- that's what's bothering me. Any plausible non-safety rationale, that's your test? So that answers Justice Gorsuch's question because, if there's at least one plausible non-safety rationale, that's good enough or -- What does that -- -- what does that mean? They -- they can regulate milling, correct? Right. Yeah. So the mining and milling occur together, correct? In other words, they occur -- you don't have mining without milling; you don't have milling without mining. If you have conventional mining. Right. But, when you're regulating mining, you're always regulating milling because you have the two together, but you can't regulate milling, as you acknowledge, but the two are interlinked in a way that I'm not sure you can disaggregate in the way you're doing. It's -- in the real world, it's not separated. If we don't accept -- If we don't accept your broader position, what do you think of the Solicitor General's suggestion that we look at whether the state has a plausible non-safety rationale? Aren't the radiological safety issues posed by the milling far more than the mining? I thought that was why you're concerned about the milling. To Justice Alito's point, it's a way to prohibit the milling, you can't do that; let's prohibit the mining, that way we prohibit the milling, which has the radiological safety concerns. I think that's the -- -- that's the point. Just one technical point -- -- on phrasing. The Solicitor General said plausible non-safety rationale.

2018,Nielsen v. Preap,116,Brett M. Kavanaugh,"Is that different from -- Why don't -- But Congress would have known or thought that it wasn't going to be immediate in many cases, correct? And -- and yet Congress did not put in a time limit, whether it's reasonable time, as Justice Breyer says, or a year or two years or six months or 48 hours. And so, when you combine those two points, Congress knew it wouldn't be immediate, and yet Congress did not put in a time limit. That raises a real question for me whether we should be superimposing a time limit into the statute when Congress, at least as I read it, did not itself do so. How do you respond to that? But you're -- I'm sorry to interrupt -- but, when you say ""when,"" you are saying that is, in essence, a time limit of immediate, same day, I think you said. And my point is that's very odd when you think about what Congress was doing in 1996, because they were well aware that would not happen, A, because of resources, B, because they're not learning about it right away. And it would be odd to think, okay, that's what this statute means, even though it would often not be effectuated in that way. Well, the -- a soft target would be what Justice Breyer might say, reasonable time. And Congress could have put that in, but -- and maybe we should, Justice Breyer's idea, but Congress didn't do that. Well, in the follow-up on -- -- the Chief Justice's point, reasonable immediacy is different from reasonable time in your view? The problem is that Congress did not trust those hearings for -- -- a certain class, is -- is my understanding, and correct me if I'm wrong about that, but Congress was concerned that those hearings were not working in the way that Congress wanted and, therefore, for a certain class of criminal or terrorist aliens, said no more. Is that presumption based on what we think was really going through Congress's mind at the time, or is it based on a constitutional overlay? Because what was really going through Congress's time in 1996 was harshness on this topic. Is that not right? Right. If -- -- if reasonable amount of time, Justice Breyer's suggestion, were part of a ruling, what do you think is a reasonable amount of time or presumptively reasonable? I know that's not your preferred position, but do you have thoughts on that? So, therefore, you would say a long period is a reasonable period, but do you have any more meat you want to put on those bones of what a reasonable period of time would be, given all the circumstances?

And all Curtis Johnson seemed to hold was that that was excluded. So why don't we follow what Curtis Johnson seemed to do in applying those general statements to the specific statute at issue here, and why wouldn't that then encompass the Florida statute, which requires more than, say, a tap on the shoulder? Well, but it -- but it's -- But it -- as you point out, it's -- it's a bit general, those statements, that language. And so how do we understand what the Court meant by that? You look at how it applied it, and it was to a battery statute, and it was a case where the government argued that the mere tap on the shoulder was okay. And the Court said no, that's not enough. But all it seemed to carve out was that kind of statute. At least as I read page 139 of the Curtis Johnson opinion, it seemed to very carefully distinguish those two situations. But -- but Curtis Johnson says substantial degree of force, as Justice Kagan points out, and how are we supposed to deal with that language in the Curtis Johnson opinion if we're trying to follow Curtis Johnson strictly? But, if they did qualify, then how many states are affected? But -- but, counsel, can I -- I say one thing on Curtis Johnson there, which is it says violent force. And if I -- if it stopped there, I think you might have an issue, but then it says ""that is force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person."" And ""capable of"" seems to me much different from what we usually, as Justice Kagan would say, think of as violent force. So maybe -- maybe there's something in Curtis Johnson itself, we've talked a lot about it, but in that one sentence, it says ""violent force"" and it says something else that seems intention with violent force.

Kavanaugh,"Well, we do have to reach -- -- we do have to reach that question because your position logically would extend to Justice Alito's hypothetical, and if prosecution is part of the national security efforts of the United States, federal prosecution, then your position would substantially hamper those national security efforts. But the logic of your position -- Part of -- part of the original understanding as well was stare decisis, and stare decisis is a principle, in my view, rooted in Article III, as Federalist 78 points out and as Justice Kagan points out. It's a doctrine of stability and humility that we take very seriously. And the reason -- with the bar that you have to clear, I believe, is not just to show that it's wrong but to show that it's grievously wrong, egregiously wrong, something meaning a very high bar because stare decisis is itself a constitutional principle. And given, as Justice Alito says, the uncertainty about the history, can you clear that bar? So two questions. Is that the right way to look at it, grievously wrong, and -- and, two, how can you clear that given some of the uncertainty? But that's begging -- that's begging the question. The whole point is that there are prior decisions going back, as Justice Kagan says, many years, reaffirming this doctrine. And the question is, when are we going to upset that stability, when are we going to depart from the humility of respecting precedent and overrule it? I mean, usually it has to be -- your -- your brief uses egregiously wrong. I -- I use the term grievously wrong. Grievously. Well, it's based -- Go ahead. They -- They also raise, of course, a general principle of individual liberty. And we've often said, as Justice Ginsburg points out, that federalism is designed to protect individual liberty. I think your basic response to that is that, actually, that's wrong in certain respects. Federal -- that this system of separate sovereigns means your individual liberty's infringed more often by double prosecution, double regulation, double taxation. Is that your answer, or do you have an answer other than that in response to the individual liberty concern? From the perspective of negative liberty, liberty -- freedom from government oppression or government regulation, your rule strikes some -- and this is what they point out -- as a -- as an infringement of basic concepts of individual liberty: You didn't get me the first time; you're going to take another crack at it.

You mentioned delivery or use, but it doesn't just say the states have complete authority over delivery or use. It's talking about the transportation or importation into any state. And why isn't that most naturally read to allow states to remain dry and, therefore, ban transportation or importation, but not to otherwise impose discriminatory or, as Justice Alito says, protectionist regulations? Wait. I'm going to stop you there. I'm sorry. Where -- where do you get that -- that idea that it somehow -- the backdrop was to give the states authority to enact protectionist legislation or legislation that discriminated against out-of-state producers, retailers, wholesalers? I -- I -- I've gone through all that, and I -- and I don't see that in the Webb-Kenyon Act, that the -- the things that led up to that were not the -- the Act was not, as I understood it, enacted to enable states to enshrine protectionist legislation into state law.

Yeah, but the 12 years, no dormant Commerce Clause problem, you said, and the rationality argument would be that it's designed to favor in-state retailers. That's rational. So that the three -- -- the three-tier system does not necessarily, in your view, entail favoritism of in-state interests? Doesn't it do that? Because when we're talking -- -- the paragraph that Justice -- The paragraph that Justice Breyer's referred to multiple times also has a quote from a Justice Scalia concurrence which that says the Twenty-First Amendment empowers the state to require that all liquor be sold by an in-state wholesaler. In other words, that is interpreting the three-tiered system, I think, to entail favoritism of in-state interests. ",when you when you say virtually complete authority and you have say several time the point of the twenty first amendment the purpose of the twenty first amendment the problem that I be have in think about this be the text the text of the twenty first amendment do not support that as i read it you mention delivery or use but it do not just say the state have complete authority over delivery or use it be talk about the transportation or importation into any state and why be not that most naturally read to allow state to remain dry and therefore ban transportation or importation but not to otherwise impose discriminatory or as justice alito say protectionist regulation wait I be go to stop you there I be sorry where where do you get that that idea that it somehow the backdrop be to give the state authority to enact protectionist legislation or legislation that discriminate against out of state producer retailer wholesaler i i I have go through all that and i and i do not see that in the webb kenyon act that the the thing that lead up to that we be not the the act be not as i understood it enact to enable state to enshrine protectionist legislation into state law when they want to when they want to remain dry state as i understand it why why be that to pick up on justice kagan s question economic protectionism be rational it be and in certain circumstance it be dispute but it be rational and maybe a dormant commerce clause problem and you be say no it be no dormant commerce clause problem then it would seem I be repeat justice kagan now the sky be the limit i know yeah but the year no dormant commerce clause problem you say and the rationality argument would be that it be design to favor in state retailer that be rational so that the three the three tier system do not necessarily in your view entail favoritism of in state interest do not it do that because when we be talk the paragraph that justice the paragraph that justice breyer s refer to multiple time also have a quote from a justice scalia concurrence which that say the twenty first amendment empower the state to require that all liquor be sell by an in state wholesaler in other word that be interpret the three tiered system i think to entail favoritism of in state interest ,146.76000000000005,Case pending,"Jan 16, 2019",Tennessee Wine and Spirits Retailers Association,"Zackary W.
