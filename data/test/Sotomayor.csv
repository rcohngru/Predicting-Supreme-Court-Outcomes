2018,Bucklew v. Precythe,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Hochman, can you tell me the current condition of your client in light of Footnote 2 of your opening brief? And in particular but not exclusively, does he still have a trach in his throat? And if he does, doesn't that moot out certain of your claims, particularly I thought much of the prep work and dangers related to him choking on his own blood. Doesn't the trach minimize that now? So we may be -- we may be issuing a decision on -- an advisory decision because, if the trach stays, it's a totally different case than if it is removed. How long has he had it now? Isn't it your job to find out if it can be removed now? I -- I -- -- I'm a little bit upset that you would come in and lodge medical records without having secured the information of whether he's physically capable of having the trach removed or not. I really don't like suspicion. But go ahead. Assuming nothing, because I don't know what's going to happen, it appears that your Dr. Zivot was misreading the horse study, that his four-minute estimate had to do with a different study having to do with a dog and a different agent, not the agent at issue here. Given that without that study there's no basis to believe that this -- that pentobarbital would take four minutes to -- to take effect, it would likely be -- I think it was -- the figures were at maximum 52 and the average is 20 to 30 seconds. That's the only evidence in the record. Is there anything left to your case once that information is eliminated -- -- that factual misstatement? But the -- I'm sorry, what -- what new facts? Is there another alternative to the cut-down to access the femoral vein? Are there any? May I -- Let me -- let me stop you right there. Let's assume -- and they're going to -- I'm going to ask them this directly. It does seem very logical that the state would give an affidavit a lot better than the one they did through Mr. Boyles that would say, no, we're not going to put him sublime, from the minute he's laid down, the gurney will have the top part raised, we've talked to the medical team, they have experience by their own requirements, they have training, education, and experience with two or three different ways to reach a femoral line. There's at least one of the two people who do. We've told them about the breathing problem. It's not going to be the same as the -- the last time. And they're prepared. Assume they came in with that. No, we're not going to let you talk to them. No, we are not going to permit discovery in a traditional way. But we are making these affirmative representations to the Court. Would you have a case left at that point? How many people have had the same condition as Mr. Bucklew? All right. So let's go to his unique circumstance. You don't deny that he has this condition? You don't deny that he has a small tumor but a tumor in his throat? All right. Very sizable. You -- so answer my earlier question. It doesn't -- I don't believe, and I would hate to think that a -- any state would intend to gratuitously subject a prisoner to untoward pain because they don't want to get a gurney that moves the head up or that they don't want to have personnel -- you require it in your own regulations. You need -- I think the words are that you have to have someone -- I read them earlier -- with the training, education, and experience to do everything that's necessary to reach the veins, et cetera. So I'm assuming you're looking for those people and have them in place. So why haven't you represented that you're going to take the basic steps necessary to avoid the horrific circumstances that your adversary says can and will happen? How do you -- why do you dispute that? All right. But that -- I'm hard pressed. As I understand the protocol, they get that one-page -- that one-page discussion that only listed his condition. The anesthesiologist -- no representation has been made that the anesthesiologist knows of his history of breathing difficulty or anything else. I'm sorry. I -- I -- Baze had to do with a generalized attack to a system of execution, and it basically said, if you don't like this system, you've got to get another because -- you have to propose another because, otherwise, what you're trying to do is to abolish the death penalty. Your intent is to do away with the death penalty, and we're not going to let you do that. I don't actually know where in the Eighth Amendment and its history the Court made up this alternative remedy idea because the Constitution certainly doesn't prohibit cruel and unusual punishment, unless we can -- unless we can't kill you at all. But putting it aside, this is -- an as-applied challenge is not going to abolish the death penalty with respect to everybody. It's going to tell the state: If you have an individual with a unique circumstance in which a method of execution is going to cause that person excruciating pain, cruel and unusual pain, you better find a different way. I don't understand why we would extend Baze to an as-applied challenge to start with. Number two, if a statute, your statute, the Court hasn't made it up, lists available alternatives, it's your job to find them and your job to put them into place. It's not the inmate's job to do that, putting aside that he neither has the resources to do it or the expertise to do it. But I'm wondering why we're assuming that Baze should be extended to an as-applied challenge at all. Secondly, address the question of why feasibility -- there are some courts who have now held the only feasible alternative is an alternative mentioned in a state statute, so now we're in a Hobbesian circle. The state gives us an option. I can't point to it. The state doesn't give me an option. Now there's no alternative. We're really in a circle that you can't get out of. Why don't we just simply say, once the first prong is met, and the courts below didn't -- they assumed it, they said there were material issues of fact, you should have gone on trial for that, I don't think the trial would have taken very long, and once that happened, you figure out how to kill him. We exempt certain people from the death penalty: the mentally ill, the incompetent, people who are young. We haven't seen that as abolishing the death penalty. We see it as -- as an as-applied exemption to a particular person or individual for whom this method is cruel and unusual. How about the constitutional -- How about the constitutional principle against unusual -- cruel and unusual punishment? I -- I think every individual has that Eighth Amendment right. That may well be, but the reality is that there are alternatives. Many of them have not been implemented because people want -- don't want to see them: the firing squad, electrocution. There's a whole lot of things that people don't want to accept the reality of, but they're there. And if you're going to make the person find a choice of how to kill himself, I simply haven't answered -- my question is, if the statute permits it, why shouldn't they be able to choose it, if they have proven -- and I understand that's a big debate here -- if they have proven that the method you've initially chosen will create cruel and unusual pain? I'm sorry, there was a prior execution where a cut-down was done by, he says, the same person who's going to do this one, and there was problems then. Why isn't it a predictive -- a reliable predictive tool to show that the same person who's going to do it now botched it earlier? Can we define -- can you define foreseeability -- or feasibility, I'm sorry? Does the statute have to authorize it for it to be feasible? Does any statute in a particular state have to authorize the method you choose? Take it now. ",mr hochman can you tell me the current condition of your client in light of footnote of your open brief and in particular but not exclusively do he still have a trach in his throat and if he do do not that moot out certain of your claim particularly i think much of the prep work and danger relate to him choke on his own blood do not the trach minimize that now so we may be we may be issue a

be a little bit upset that you would come in and lodge medical record without have secure the information of whether he be physically capable of have the trach remove or not i really do not like

2018,Apple v. Pepper,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I'm sorry, the -- the first sale is from Apple to the customer. It's the customer who pays the 30 percent. Could I ask you something -- -- more generally about Illinois Brick? That was a case of a vertical monopoly: A concrete block person, manufacturer, monopolizes the next intermediate market who then sells to a customer. All right. This is not quite like that. This is dramatically different. This is a closed loop. They're not claiming the 30 percent is their injury. They're -- they're claiming their injury is the suppression of -- of a cheaper price, doesn't have to be 30 percent. They're not seeking 30 percent of their sales. They have to go out and prove at the next step how, without this monopoly, they would have paid less. It could be as little as a -- a penny or nothing or it could be something more. But the point is that this closed loop with Apple as its spoke, they are the first purchaser of that 30 percent markup. Apple took 30 percent from the customer, not from the developer. General, the problem is that they're not measuring damages by that. As I understand, they're saying it's not the 30 percent; it is what the price would be if we could buy apps outside of this closed loop. And it could be theoretically a lot higher than the markup, it could well be within it, but the point is that that 30 percent -- that 30 percent or whatever that 30 -- -- percent figure is, is not the measure of our damages. That's as I understand -- -- that they're saying the developers may have their own claim, their damages likely have to stay within the 30 percent, but we don't measure our damages by that. Now -- The General said that if, in fact, Apple bought these products from suppliers and paid them and then added 30 percent to you, that that would be a classic antitrust violation. You're saying -- that's basically what they're doing here anyway. But let's take the reverse. Let's say they collected money from you and paid all of it over to the developer and then told the developer: Give us 30 percent of that back. Would you then still be a direct purchaser and -- ",I be sorry the the first sale be from apple to the customer it be the customer who pay the percent could i ask you something more generally about illinois brick that be a case of a vertical monopoly a concrete block person manufacturer monopolize the next intermediate market who then sell to a customer all right this be not quite like that this be dramatically different this be a closed loop they be not claim the percent be their injury they be they be claim their injury be the suppression of of a cheap price do not have to be percent they be not seek percent of their sale they have to go out and prove at the next step how without this monopoly they would have pay less it could be as little as a a penny or nothing or it could be something more but the point be that this close loop with apple as its spoke they be the first purchaser of that percent markup apple take percent from the customer not from the developer general the problem be that they be not measure damage by that as i understand they be say it be not the percent it be what the price would be if we could buy apps outside of this closed loop and it could be theoretically a lot high than the markup it could well be within it but the point be that that percent that percent or whatever that percent figure be be not the measure of our damage that be as i understand that they be say the developer may have their own claim their damage likely have to stay within the percent but we do not measure our damage by that now the general say that if in fact apple buy these product from supplier and pay them and then add percent to you that that would be a classic antitrust violation you be say that be basically what they be do here anyway but let us take the reverse let us say they collect money from you and pay all of it over to the developer and then tell the developer give us percent of that back would you then still be a direct purchaser and ,166.92,Case pending,"Nov 26, 2018","Apple, Inc.","Robert Pepper, et al.",17-204,"Jun 18, 2018",,113.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2018,"Mission Product Holdings, Inc. v. Tempnology, LLC",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"How is that relevant? Meaning, yes, I -- I assume that there's both a contractual obligation and a legal obligation under trademark law, but to the extent that there's a rejection of the contract, the property owner is electing to say, as he -- as it is entitled to say under the law, I reject that obligation vis-a-vis you. Hence, you can't continue to use my mark because I can't assure -- I'm not capable -- that's why you reject a contract, because it's not beneficial to the company -- I reject that obligation. Hence, I reject your being able to use it. Why? Why? Why isn't that exactly how it works? Meaning, once I lend you something and say it's conditioned on my approval of what you're doing, and I withdraw that approval, haven't I withdrawn -- One of the trademark amici briefs said, if you're the licensee, you don't have the right to produce an item. If this license was one in which I gave you the license to sell my goods, that they -- and I refuse to sell you the goods, they can't go out and make the goods, they can't go out and put the trademark on something else because they don't have the right to do that. I don't disagree, but the point is that you've been -- that by rejecting the contract, I've basically said you can't use my goods. You're -- you're entitled to sue me. You can't use my mark. You're entitled to sue me. I do have a question about -- -- 365(n). Which is 365(n) is not the default rule with respect to intellectual property. It gives more and less rights to the lessors and lessees than the common law would permit. Seems counterintuitive to me or counterlogical, given the explanation that the Congress gave, that it understood that trademark owners would get more rights than (n) provides to other licensors in the intellectual property field. It mentioned the reason why the courts up to that time who had recognized rejection as termination, that trademark owners were different because they had quality control problems. So I read that and I think to myself: Why would you think of giving trademark owners more rights or less rights than -- than people under (n)? But it didn't -- it didn't think it was wrong completely. Because -- because it -- it did a sort of hybrid, giving more and less at the same time. Not really. It -- it -- it kept some of it and it rejected others because of the situational difference. Before you -- But, wait a minute, it had stopped -- it had said two years before, leading up to the agreement, that it wasn't going to order any goods. Were you producing your own goods using their trademark, or were you just -- -- buying from them? So they no longer had to supply you with goods. So why are we here? Meaning -- -- that's a brief -- they have -- they have -- they have an obligation and you're open to damages, but without an -- without you producing the goods, I thought that brief from the amici said that you're relieved from supplying goods, the lessor is relieved from supplying goods. So go back to the argument you were making. So the court tells them you can't, you don't have an exclusive license. That's been waived or forfeited. So what remains of this case? Because you're saying under their theory they can't move forward, they have a non-exclusive license, but if they're not getting goods, what's their -- why isn't this case moot? Except the report said exactly the opposite, that they weren't taking a position. So it can't be that their entire -- their entire purpose was to overrule. As I mentioned, they overruled it in part and didn't in part. Because there are certain contracts they gave the lessees more rights or the lessors more rights. They exempted some things from royalty payments or royalty setoffs. They did a bunch of different things. I'm sorry, I don't really understand that argument. It seems as all of these are exceptions by their nature, and that goes contrary to the general rule that if it's an exception, the rule is different than the exception. That's what you think, but, you know, the greatest problem here is that rejection is not a contract term. We don't -- when we talk about contracts, we talk about repudiating them, terminating them, avoiding them, a bunch of different language. But bankruptcy is using a very specialized term, rejection. And your adversary's right that it's not generally that we reject a piece of a contract. We generally reject the entire contract. And so it's not the rejection of one claim under a contract. So it -- there is some force to their argument that reading it the way you do is contrary to its language. The -- the bankruptcy court did not stop that non-exclusive use, correct? Could you answer the solicitor general's concern that a ruling in your favor would affect any number of other contracts, the copier example, the -- the car example, any of the other, or the McDonald's franchise? And the McDonald's franchise? I'm sorry -- -- but I don't know why that doesn't control non-bankruptcy rights. Your point would seem to control both, but it doesn't seem to. You're saying bankruptcy gives you more rights. Do you have any argument that would limit a ruling in your favor just to trademark law? Because it seems to me that you're asking us to do exactly what the other side wants us to do, to announce a general interpretation of this provision that basically says these types of contracts actually do survive -- -- lessees have the right to terminate, in part, and keep other rights alive. You -- I thought when I read your briefs that you had an argument as to why we should limit our ruling to trademark law. But there's no way to do that even under your interpretation. That's somewhat different because that requires actual affirmative obligations by the employers. And you're not arguing the employer has to -- the trademark owner has to continue his rights. Could you -- -- answer just one question for me? If you continue using the mark, do the damages that you incur after the filing of the bankruptcy -- are they prepetition debt or postpetition debt? Are you going to get a priority for the damages that accrue after you declare bankruptcy -- after bankruptcy had been declared? So -- -- you're going to get more rights than (n) gives other intellectual -- -- property. ",how be that relevant meaning yes i i assume that there be both a contractual obligation and a legal obligation under trademark law but to the extent that there be a rejection of the contract the property owner be elect to say as he as it be entitle to say under the law i reject that obligation vis a vi you hence you can not continue to use my mark because i can not assure I be not capable that be why you reject a contract because it be not beneficial to the company i reject that obligation hence i reject your be able to use it why why why be not that exactly how it work meaning once i

go back to the argument you we be make so the court tell them you can not you do not have an exclusive license that be be waive or forfeit so what remain of this case because you be say under their

2018,"Washington State Department of Licensing v. Cougar Den, Inc.",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I'm sorry. Could you tell me could you tax the tribe's buying of the fuel in another state? They take the truck, they leave your state, they go to another state, they buy the fuel. Can you tax them in the buying of that fuel? All right. So the question is, in my mind, whether the travel rights to freely use the highways permit you to tax them for an incidence carrying the fuel from another state on a highway through your state, correct? Now the court below called this an importation tax. You've been resisting that, and you call it a use tax. But, if it's an importation tax, it's not equally applied. There are wholesalers of all kind who can import without paying the tax, correct? What is the -- the license? Is it a way to get them not to pay? Who pays for the fuel then once you're licensed? You're a wholesaler, you bring it in, I'm assuming by vessel or by pipeline. Then the person who buys the fuel uses it, correct? If we accept that the travel provision entitled this tribe to travel with goods back and forth to a market without a tax, without a license, just like in the fishing rights case, then what gives you the right to charge them within the state? Meaning they're traveling free of tax, free of license, they go to the reservation, you can't tax them on the reservation. So I'm not quite sure what permits you to tax them at all. If you can't tax them when they picked up the fuel. At the market. But you've just admitted that at the market where they pick this up, you couldn't tax them. Well, that -- But even in the fishing rights case, which you don't see as -- as comparable, but others might argue it is, the state can regulate for public interest conservation points. The Indian tribe has conceded that you can regulate for public interest on a highway. That wasn't superseded by the treaty. But what they bargained for was to -- to carry goods back and forth from the market without a burden. That was their bargain. Just as, under the fishing rights treaty, they can go and collect fish without paying a tax or getting a license for that fish. Or impose a toll to do it. Well, that's the public interest. Well, there's one central part, which is they traveled the highways for free. They weren't burdened by economic -- by economic manner in traveling the highway. So we go back to Justice Breyer's question, which is whether it's 50 cents or a million dollars, you're saying if it's 50 cents or 5 or 10, presumably, it's okay, you can burden them with that. You just can't burden them -- and I presume you would say every other citizen -- by imposing a million dollars? Is that your point? So you're going back to the point that Justice Gorsuch ended with, which is that you're reading ""in common with all others"" differently in this context than in the fishing rights context? Well, the one difference that you can't get around is they didn't sign a treaty and give away that much real estate to get nothing in return, to be treated exactly like every other citizen in traveling the highway. You just said it: without taxes imposed. Does it mean anything that this tax is literally on traveling the route, importing by a highway? There is no similar tax on importation by licensed people. They don't pay the tax. Only the user who buys it pays the tax, correct? The problem is it's not consistent. You're right, the wholesalers, licensed wholesalers are the importers, but they don't pay the tax. They don't have a treaty with everybody. ",I be sorry could you tell me could you tax the tribe s buying of the fuel in another state they take the truck they leave your state they go to another state they buy the fuel can you tax them in the buying of that fuel all right so the question be in my mind whether the travel right to freely use the highway permit you to tax them for an incidence carry the fuel from another state on a highway through your state correct now the court below call this an importation tax you have be resist that and you call it a use tax but if it be an importation tax it be not equally apply there be wholesaler of all kind who can import without pay the tax correct what be the the license be it a way to get them not to pay who pay for the fuel then once you be license you be a wholesaler you bring it in I be assume by vessel or by pipeline then the person who buy the fuel use it correct if we accept that the travel provision entitle this tribe to travel with good back and forth to a market without a tax without a license just like in the fishing right case then what give you the right to charge them within the state meaning they be travel free of tax free of license they go to the reservation you can not tax them on the reservation so I be not quite sure what permit you to tax them at all if you can not tax them when they pick up the fuel at the market but you have just admit that at the market where they pick this up you could not tax them well that but even in the fishing right case which you do not see as as comparable but others might argue it be the state can regulate for public interest conservation point the indian tribe have concede that you can regulate for public interest on a highway that be not supersede by the treaty but what they bargain for be to to carry good back and forth from the market without a burden that be their bargain just as under the fishing right treaty they can go and collect fish without pay a tax or get a license for that fish or impose a toll to do it well that be the public interest well there be one central part which be they travel the highway for free they be not burden by economic by economic manner in travel the highway so we go back to justice breyer s question which be whether it be cent or a million dollar you be say if it be cent or or presumably it be okay you can burden them with that you just can not burden them and i presume you would say every other citizen by impose a million dollar be that your point so you be go back to the point that justice gorsuch end with which be that you be read in common with all others differently in this context than in the fishing right context well the one difference that you can not get around be they do not sign a treaty and give away that much real estate to get nothing in return to be treat exactly like every other citizen in travel the highway you just say it without tax impose do it mean anything that this tax be literally on travel the route import by a highway there be no similar tax on importation by licensed people they do not pay the tax only the user who buy it pay the tax correct the problem be it be not consistent you be right the wholesaler license wholesaler be the importer but they do not pay the tax they do not have a treaty with everybody ,267.04,Case pending,"Oct 30, 2018",Washington State Department of Licensing,"Cougar Den, Inc.",16-1498,"Jun 25, 2018",,113.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2018,Dawson v. Steager,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"What do we do with the fact that the job duties of marshals overlap with the two categories of the state? They overlap with the people paying less tax and with other law enforcement agents who pay more tax. So how do we go about identifying -- -- who they're most similar to? Could I go back to the two categories? Let's assume they're identical. All right? And I know that you're arguing that they're not, and this may be an issue, if we get to it, to remand, okay? But assuming they were, and if the difference was as articulated by Respondents here, one paid more than the other to the pension plan, so they -- the State wanted to be more generous to those who paid more, as I think is the case here. Why is that any different in kind to our suggestions in Davis and in other places that, if a scheme relied on the benefits paid out, anybody who made less than $15,000 a year in retirement benefits was exempt, but someone who made more wasn't, why is that different in kind to this situation? I'm sorry -- -- can you go back and answer Justice Kagan's earlier question, which is, what are -- what are we remanding for? I -- I do think that there's been a concession that the job duties of federal marshals are similar to the exempted class. So what's left? You -- you said something to her that confused me. I thought you said, if the State had actually differentiated their employees on the basis of the contribution they made or the benefits they received, then the scheme would be okay if the federal marshals didn't -- well, they would never make the contribution, so -- but maybe they have different benefits. I'm sorry, the court below didn't say that. The court below said -- I think the court below very explicitly said the two -- exempt category and federal marshals were similar. And they didn't even look at the comparison at all. They said the purpose was not to discriminate; so, hence, there was no discrimination. That's right. It didn't find that, so you can't rely on that? You have to -- you have to defend its judgment. And I thought it based it on saying, if your purpose is to benefit your state employees, that's not discrimination. Now that's a hard line for me to accept because discrimination is treating someone differently. Whether it's because you want to benefit someone else or to -- or -- or harm another person, to me, seems irrelevant. I think you're having the problem I did from the beginning, which is everybody breaks this down into two steps, but it really is one step. It -- it -- because you don't even get to this inquiry unless state and federal employees are being treated different. That seems like a very light load to carry. The question is, are they similarly situated? And similarly situated in the sense of can you differentiate them on something other than the source of payment? I'm sorry -- -- there's never going to be an identical federal plan to an identical state plan unless the state chooses to model its plan on -- out of a federal plan. This is an invitation to just throw Davis away. All a state has to say is we're going to favor our retirees because our plan is structured in X way and the federal plan is not. It makes no sense to me, what you're saying. So, even if the two plans are identical, merely because the state chooses a police-officer-only plan, that's enough of a difference to do away with Davis? Why isn't that just plain source? It's a simple -- Could you slow down? You've got a lot of generalities. Give me specifics.

2018,Manhattan Community Access Corp. v. Halleck,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I'm sorry. It just means it's a mixed actor, meaning you can -- it has its own speech. Government often has its own speech. So that it can create speech, I don't think, means anything. Similarly, time, place regulations, that anybody can do that or -- or whether it's the government or a private actor with respect to property. So the question, I think, is, does it have discretion with respect to the content and its viewpoint neutrality on what the state is controlling, which is the placement rights on these cable lines? Only because it's the agent directly of the state. The state has the relationship with Time Warner and tells them that Time Warner must deal with MNN. Physical goods, that's like the railroads owning the railroad track. But for decades now -- not for decades -- for centuries, our cases have recognized that the railroad can own -- can own the tracks, it can own the switches, it can own the depots, but there's still a government access right to the use of the rail -- of the -- of the tracks. So, here, the government controls the content of what's on those cables. That's never -- that's always the case with property. Property is a right -- a prop -- a property right is a right or privilege to use something to the exclusion of others or to the exclusion of the other owners. So, I mean, it's a simple definition of what a property right is. But none of those cases involved the state or the government designating something a public forum. They've involved traditional public forums. That's a different issue. But we have three categories: traditional, designated, and private. And this is very different because this is the government designating this a public forum. But not all of them are designated public forums. Many of them are limited. But this one is very different. This one says first-come, first-served, and your only discretion is against things that are not speech, obscenity, et cetera. So -- -- what's the difference -- if we go back to the questions my colleagues asked earlier, the city rents a theater, doesn't own it, but rents it or leases it or somehow takes possession of it through contract. It designates it a public forum, says anyone can use the theater, first-come, first-served, although -- and hires someone to administer that forum. So what's the difference? I -- I -- I don't understand. You -- they can -- they have to clean it. They have to -- The administrator has to get it cleaned, has to provide security -- -- has to sort of organize the -- the hours, et cetera, but, nevertheless, the city says this -- we've -- we rent the property, we have the power to tell you keep it open, keep it free, keep it first-come, first-served; your only ability to restrict is time, place, and/or obscenity and other illegal conduct. But why do you need that? If the city rents it, says this is how we're going to use it, this is the way it's going to be used, why do you need anything more? What greater control do you need? So now -- -- now we have the state eluding responsibility by simply figuring out how to have adequate independence. In designating public functions, all it has to do is say we're just going to tip it over the line a little bit. Or keep away from the line a little bit. So can you explain the flip of what I think may be troubling -- I may be wrong -- Justice Breyer is -- and -- and Justice Alito? If this is the administrator for the state -- I know you sued the state, the city here, but you then dismissed your case against it. Could you have just sued the city and not MNN? So you think the city would be protected by Monell theories? Its agent, its -- its administrator as agent? So it would be like the police officer who uses excessive force? But the city retained the right in the franchise agreement to dedicate this to the public use? To designate this a public forum? ",I be sorry it just mean it be a mixed actor mean you can it have its own speech government often have its own speech so that it can create speech i do not think mean anything similarly time place regulation that anybody can do that or or whether it be the government or a private actor with respect to property so the question i think be do it have discretion with respect to the content and its viewpoint neutrality on what the state be control which be the placement right on these cable line only because it be the agent directly of the state the state have the relationship with time warner and tell them that time warner must deal with mnn physical good that be like the railroad own the railroad track but for decade now not for decade for century our case have recognize that the railroad can own can own the track it can own the switch it can own the depot but there be still a government access right to the use of the rail of the of the track so here the government control the content of what be on those cable that be never that be always the case with property property be a right a prop a property right be a right or privilege to use something to the exclusion of others or to the exclusion of the other owner so i mean it be a simple definition of what a property right be but none of those case involve the state or the government designate something a public forum they have involve traditional public forum that be a different issue but we have three category traditional designate and private and this be very different because this be the government designate this a public forum but not all of them be designate public forum many of them be limited but this one be very different this one say first come first serve and your only discretion be against thing that be not speech obscenity et cetera so what be the difference if we go back to the question my colleague ask earlier the city rent a theater do not own it but rent it or lease it or somehow take possession of it through contract it designate it a public forum say anyone can use the theater first come first serve although and hire someone to administer that forum so what be the difference i i i do not understand you they can they have to clean it they have to the administrator have to get it clean have to provide security have to sort of organize the the hour et cetera but nevertheless the city say this we have we rent the property we have the power to tell you keep it open keep it free keep it first come first serve your only ability to restrict be time place andor obscenity and other illegal conduct but why do you need that if the city rent it say this be how we be go to use it this be the way it be go to be use why do you need anything more what great control do you need so now now we have the state elude responsibility by simply figure out how to have adequate independence in designate public function all it have to do be say we be just go to tip it over the line a little bit or keep away from the line a little bit so can you explain the flip of what i think may be trouble i may be wrong justice breyer be and and justice alito if this be the administrator for the state i know you sue the state the city here but you then dismiss your case against it could you have just sue the city and not mnn so you think the city would be protect by monell theory its agent its its administrator as agent so it would be like the police officer who use excessive force but the city retain the right in the franchise agreement to dedicate this to the public use to designate this a public forum ,280.7400000000002,Case pending,"Feb 25, 2019","Manhattan Community Access Corporation, et al.","Deedee Halleck, et al.",17-1702,"Oct 12, 2018",,113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2018,The American Legion v. American Humanist Association,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Do you know how many other parks are like this one? I've looked at pictures, and this is an unusual park because there's major highways dividing it up. It's almost as if the city artificially designed an area that's huge to encompass other plaques and declared it a park. But you can't really tell that this cross is with anything else. There's three or four -- six-lane highway on one side. There's another highway on the other. I'm told you can't even get off the highways to walk to this cross. So -- All right. And you said ""dismember or destroy."" You can move it. You could transfer the land to private entities, correct? So is destruction and -- and anything else. Then give it back to the Legion. They could -- they could speak to that. But putting that aside, are you relying on the fact that -- at all, that -- at least one brief claims that all 49 soldiers named on this plaque or for whom this plaque were were Christian? Is it -- are you just grandfathering this, or are you claiming that today, let's say, for the Vietnam War, that any government, local or state, could build a cross 40 feet high, not put any emblem on or some sectarian emblem, and say we are dedicating this to all the soldiers who have died in the Vietnam War? No, no, but answer my question. What is the tradition? Is the tradition that, in World War II, a cross was used, or is the tradition that the government can put up sectarian symbols, like crosses or a picture of Jesus Christ, in honor of anyone because that's within the nation's tradition? Well, would that be -- If -- if the Chief would per -- If the Chief would permit me. There is a brief here that says that, to deeply religious Christians, secularizing the cross is blasphemy. Christ died on the cross. He was resurrected from his grave. So those people don't view secularizing the cross as something -- it's not just Jewish people or Hindu people who might be offended. It could be Christians as well. So we go back to Justice -- So we go back to Justice Gorsuch. I hear you using the word ""de facto"" -- ""extreme proselytization,"" ""de facto coercion."" ""Excessive promotion or proselytization."" It is the endorsement test. Now you may make an argument like your colleague that this has to do more with tradition than it does with coercion, but it is endorsement. So you would overturn Allegheny under that theory? In all places? Meaning I don't know of a founding father, town or state, that put up a 40-foot cross on government property. So we don't have a long tradition of that. It's sectarian. We have a lot of founding fathers, including George Washington, who was exceedingly careful to ensure that references to God were as neutral as possible to as many religions as possible. So it can't be that all sectarian symbols, whether it's a cross or Jesus Christ or some other symbol, is within our tradition merely because we say ""In God we trust."" But you're -- But you limited your point to one generalized point, which means we could put it up today to memorialize all Vietnam vets, despite the fact that all Vietnam vets were not Christian -- -- and that many of them would feel -- Isn't a cemetery substantially different than the middle of a town where something is 40 foot high? I mean, I have pictures of this cross. It's the only thing that's that high. It dwarfs buildings. It dwarfs people. You can barely see them in the pictures. Were those statues built by private people and placed in the parks? If I'm remembering -- Yes. Can we go back outside of hypotheticals to this case? Mr. Katyal said that the only way to have a remedy here is to destroy -- change the cross or destroy it. He says you can't move it because it'll fall apart, and you can't give it to the Legion because of safety concerns. Do you agree with his position on this? I do understand also that the cross is falling apart and has to be fixed anyway. So whether it's fixed in a move or fixed in place in situ is irrelevant. It still has to be fixed. May -- may I go back to the question that's been underlying some of my colleagues' points and points you've been trying to make. It is contextual, the endorsement test is always contextual, and, according to you, contextually, the 50 crosses that Justice Alito and Breyer are worried about, you don't think it's 50? You still think it may be only 10 or 20. So I accept that. Can we, given the nature of the right at issue, given that the other side concedes that there's extreme proselytization, that there is -- and there has to be, because the First Amendment -- there has to be de facto coercion to make any sense of the Establishment Clause. And defining that is always going to involve context. You were giving up the reasonable observer test. You were talking about an objective factors test. Could you go into that a little bit more? I think the question -- -- is different. I think the question is do we think that -- since there are other avenues available, that the Constitution doesn't require this floor -- -- as a constitutional floor for an Establishment Clause violation. I think that's the question that's being asked. Mr. Katyal, how -- Mr. Katyal -- -- there's a call and a discussion about undoing Lemon altogether. Substituting something like a coercion test, whatever, with or without limits. What position are you taking -- -- on behalf of the commission -- of -- ",do you know how many other park be like this one I have look at picture and this be an unusual park because there be major

2018,Mont v. United States,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"I thought the purposes of pretrial detention were for security issues, were protecting the community from the danger the defendant may pose, correct? And so I'm assuming your argument is that that period of safety is not a period for conviction; the credit is just a credit; it's not the purpose for the detention? He was imprisoned for detention purposes, safety, not for his conviction? So you're back to ""is imprisoned""? And the -- my colleagues are saying there are two textual clues here. One is the present tense of the statute, which favors you, because ""is imprisoned"" for what purpose? It's not for the purpose of the conviction. He is being held for safety, safety concerns or flight concerns, whatever, not because of a conviction yet. And on the other side is imprisonment in connection -- in connection with a conviction. And the Chief and Justice Ginsburg are saying that language favors the other side's reading because, once you're given the credit, that credit shows a connection with the conviction. That's the argument. Now the question for me is, what breaks the tie? Why, if there's a tie between those two textual clues, I should elect your reading and not their reading? I didn't say there was. I'm assuming it. But -- but -- They do have -- -- a remedy, though, that district court judge. They can issue a warrant, correct? That is something that favors you, the fact that, under the government's reading, if someone is later released or the charges are dismissed, there is no tolling. So that if the charges are dismissed at the end of this detention and no credit is given, then there's no tolling. And the judge who sat on his or her rights of issuing a warrant loses out, correct? That doesn't make much sense. If this statute was intended to read the way that Justice Alito suggested, as a look-back statute, that wouldn't make much sense. Was this argument raised below, this part of the argument? What do you do with a situation that happens commonly in district court, and, in fact, there are some statutes, I believe -- I could be wrong -- that require mandatory detention after a guilty plea or a jury finding? So someone can be out and the jury -- there are some judges who do this routinely. The minute that you're convicted, they basically do a new bail hearing and put most people in. Would that, under your theory of the case, still not be imprisonment relating to the conviction? The Dictionary Act says that the presumption is it's the present tense, but Congress can not do that. So go ahead and finish. Wouldn't you draft the statute clearly, more clearly, and in a different way if that's what Congress intended? As Justice Ginsburg -- as Justice -- my, now I've done it -- as Justice Kagan has just said to you -- (Laughter.) -- there is ambiguity, doesn't that ambiguity suggest that there is a clearer way to write this if that's what Congress intended? They could, instead of imprisonment, they could have said for any period of detention. But why? The probation office determination or the judge's determination is by a preponderance of the evidence. An acquittal really doesn't tell you whether or not that defendant had successfully integrated into the community or not because the judge could always hold a hearing and by a preponderance of the evidence find that he or she hadn't, and still keep them longer, maybe until the earlier case is decided. But the point is that it seems to me that that acquittal -- I don't understand the legislative grace or how you get it out of the language of this statute. But if he wasn't -- -- and he was -- he would have been just as detained, why shouldn't the time under your reading be extended? So -- So let's assume the following hypothetical: Defendant is arrested for drug charges. He's later acquitted, but while in jail, he now commits a drug offense. Your claim would be the district court can't find a violation in that situation because the period has been suspended? He can't issue a warrant then? That -- that's what renders the ""is imprisoned"" language a little bit suspect in this statute, because you're sort of looking backwards all the time. Instead of looking at present moment, the suspension period starts 30 days after detention, you're looking forward. You're looking forward if you start counting it from whenever the conviction or the sentence happens. By the way, on that issue, that wasn't reached by the courts below. You did raise it below? All right, so they didn't have to reach it? And it wasn't argued? Has any other court argued that point -- or, I'm sorry, not argued, addressed that issue and decided it? There's at least two, Ninth Circuit and -- -- and one other circuit who are -- who are on Petitioner's side. Have either of those two courts addressed this issue? In that case? But they didn't address the legal question in full? All right. So why should we be the first ones to address it? Assuming we disagree with you on the main point and agree with your adversary, why should we reach a question that hasn't been addressed fully by the courts below? No, no, I'm saying if we agree on the question -- with her on the question granted, why should we reach your alternative argument? That -- that -- that once he entered a -- a conviction, the detention changed from security to -- to imprisonment for a conviction? Is there a reason -- I'm -- I'm sorry. Could you tell me if there's a cost to filing a warrant by a judge? I mean, other than the administrative cost of ordering the warrant and it being lodged, is there something else that the judge would have to do or the system would have to do to effect that warrant or to keep it active -- -- that would be a reason why a judge wouldn't just issue a warrant when someone's arrested? What did they do here? Yeah. Did they have any contact with the defendant? Did they reach out to the state court? Do we know whether they continued any of the functions of supervised release? ",i think the purpose of pretrial detention we be for security issue we be protect the community from the danger the defendant may pose correct and so I be assume your argument be that that period of safety be not a period for conviction the credit be just a credit it be not the purpose for the detention he be imprison for detention purpose safety not for his conviction so you be back to be imprison and the my colleague be say there be two textual clue here one be the present tense of the statute which favor you because be imprisoned for what purpose it be not for the purpose of the conviction he be be hold for safety safety concern or flight concern whatever not because of a conviction yet and on the other side be imprisonment in connection in connection with a conviction and the chief and justice ginsburg be say that language favor the other side s reading because once you be give the credit that credit show a connection with the conviction that be the argument now the question for me be what break the tie why if there be a tie between those two textual clue i should elect your reading and not their reading i do not say there be I be assume it but but they do have a remedy though that district court judge they can issue a warrant correct that be something that favor you the fact that under the government s reading if someone be later release or the charge be dismiss there be no tolling so that if the charge be dismiss at the end of this detention and no credit be give then there be no tolling and the judge who sit on his or her right of issue a warrant lose out correct that do not make much sense if this statute be intend to read the way that justice alito suggest as a look back statute that would not make much sense be this argument raise below this part of the argument what do you do with a situation that happen commonly in district court and in fact there be some statute i believe i could be wrong that require mandatory detention after a guilty plea or a jury finding so someone can be out and the jury there be some judge who do this routinely the minute that you be convict they basically do a new bail hearing and put most people in would that under your theory of the case still not be imprisonment relate to the conviction the dictionary act say that the presumption be it be the present tense but congress can not do that so go ahead and finish would not you draft the statute clearly more clearly and in a different way if that be what congress intend as justice ginsburg as justice my now I have do it as justice kagan have just say to you laughter there be ambiguity do not that ambiguity suggest that there be a clear way to write this if that be what congress intend they could instead of imprisonment they could have say for any period of detention but why the probation office determination or the judge s determination be by a preponderance of the evidence an acquittal really do not tell you whether or not that defendant have successfully integrate into the community or not because the judge could always hold a hearing and by a preponderance of the evidence find that he or she have not and still keep them longer maybe until the early case be decide but the point be that it seem to me that that acquittal i do not understand the legislative grace or how you get it out of the language of this statute but if he be not and he be he would have be just as detained why should not the time under your reading be extend so so let us assume the following hypothetical defendant be arrest for drug charge he be later acquit but while in jail he now commit a drug offense your claim would be the district court can not find a violation in that situation because the period have be suspend he can not issue a warrant then that that be what render the be imprison language a little bit suspect in this statute because you be sort of look backwards all the time instead of look at present moment the suspension period start day after detention you be look forward you be look forward if you start count it from whenever the conviction or the sentence happen by the way on that issue that be not reach by the court below you do raise it below all right so they do not have to reach it and it be not argue have any other court argue that point or I be sorry not argue address that issue and decide it there be at least two ninth circuit and and one other circuit who be who be on petitioner s side have either of those two court address this issue in that case but they do not address the legal question in full all right so why should we be the first one to address it assume we disagree with you on the main point and agree with your adversary why should we reach a question that have not be address fully by the court below no no I be say if we agree on the question with her on the question grant why should we reach your alternative argument that that that once he enter a a conviction the detention change from security to to imprisonment for a conviction be there a reason I be I be sorry could you tell me if there be a cost to file a warrant by a judge i mean other than the administrative cost of order the warrant and it be lodge be there something else that the judge would have to do or the system would have to do to effect that warrant or to keep it active that would be a reason why a judge would not just issue a warrant when someone s arrest what do they do here yeah do they have any contact with the defendant do they reach out to the state court do we know whether they continue any of the function of supervised release ,438.51000000000016,Case pending,"Feb 26, 2019",Jason J.

2018,Timbs v. Indiana,113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Is there any in rem forfeiture, not this one, which relied on the criminal activity of this defendant, but let's say that Austin -- that the state did away with innocent owner defense so that the forfeiture was against the innocent owner. Would that be punishment? I think under our -- my reading of Austin, it was that only those forfeitures that are punitive count under the clause. So what can a state do to take it out of its punitive nature? So they do away with the innocent owner defense, and the innocent owner comes in and says, this is my property, I didn't commit a crime. They say it's too bad. The property did. Why? If it's not punitive against him, it's the property that is being charged -- -- with having been involved in a crime. General, yeah, that -- that is true, but that's because at a certain -- up to a certain point in our history, we didn't apply the Bill of Rights to the states. So, in all of the situations before we apply the Bill of Rights to this -- before we apply the Bill of Rights to states, they did things that, under incorporation, were unconstitutional. And in most of our cases, they were history going both ways. Some states did; some states didn't. So, really, what the issue that we have to look at isn't -- is where has our understanding come to in terms of a particular Bill of Rights? And in Austin, we said it is a long part of history that punitive sanctions cannot be excessive. And Justice Scalia said it very well: For the Eighth Amendment to limit cash fines while permitting -- permitting limitless in-kind assessments would make little sense, altering only the form of the Star Chamber abuses. So, at a certain point in Austin, we looked at what had happened to in rem forfeiture and realized that we had just changed the Star Chamber form. I -- I -- I don't actually understand your argument based on history because, without incorporation, the history's going to be what you want it to be. The real question is the fundamental right. Are we trying to avoid a society that's like the Char -- Star Chamber? And if we look at these forfeitures that are occurring today, and that's what Austin documented, many of them seem grossly disproportionate to the crimes being charged. So how do you deal with that? How do we avoid a Star Chamber return? So, just so I'm clear, you're asking us to overrule Austin? Because that's the only way that you can win with a straight face? ",be there any in rem forfeiture not this one which rely on the criminal activity of this defendant but let us say that austin that the state do away with innocent owner defense so that the forfeiture be against the innocent owner would that be punishment i think under our my reading of austin it be that only those forfeiture that be punitive count under the clause so what can a state do to take it out of its punitive nature so they do away with the innocent owner defense and the innocent owner come in and say this be my property i do not commit a crime they say it be too bad the property do why if it be not punitive against him it be the property that be be charge with have be involve in a crime general yeah that that be true but that be because at a certain up to a certain point in our history we do not apply the bill of right to the state so in all of the situation before we apply the bill of right to this before we apply the bill of right to state they do thing that under incorporation we be unconstitutional and in most of our case they we be history go both way some state do some state do not so really what the issue that we have to look at be not be where have our understanding come to in term of a particular bill of right and in austin we say it be a long part of history that punitive sanction can not be excessive and justice scalia say it very well for the eighth amendment to limit cash fine while permit permit limitless in kind assessment would make little sense alter only the form of the star chamber abuse so at a certain point in austin we look at what have happen to in rem forfeiture and realize that we have just change the star chamber form i i i do not actually understand your argument base on history because without incorporation the history s go to be what you want it to be the real question be the fundamental right be we try to avoid a society that be like the char star chamber and if we look at these forfeiture that be occur today and that be what austin document many of them seem grossly disproportionate to the crime be charge so how do you deal with that how do we avoid a star chamber return so just so I be clear you be ask us to overrule austin because that be the only way that you can win with a straight face ,185.96,Roberts Court,"Nov 28, 2018",Tyson Timbs,Indiana,17-1091,"Jun 18, 2018","Feb 20, 2019",113.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2018,"Rimini Street, Inc. v. Oracle USA, Inc.",113,Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Perry, I -- I understand all that case law. I think your adversary would argue, number one, that full costs in the Copyright Act predated -- predated both the definitional inclusion of costs in the federal statutes and that it had a history, a meaning, independent of what happened later. You haven't addressed how you get rid of that independent meaning argument. Number two, I think your adversary pointed us to three statutes of many that have the word ""full costs."" Give me a meaning to those three statutes that would give effect to the word ""full."" But it's discretionary under both the Copyright Act now and under the statute. The government hasn't excepted that yet, though. Could you point me to where in your brief or an amici accounted for those 800 cases? When I read this argument, the first prong by you, I thought could it mean full costs, 1920, without the limits of 1821? No, I -- I understand that, but I still don't -- I'm still trying to give meaning to ""full."" And -- and so 1821 sets certain limits. If we read ""full costs"" to not invoke those limits but just to permit awards of what's specified in 1920, would that take care of your problem? You didn't adopt your adversary's on-and-off switch for the meaning of ""full."" So explain -- Mr. Clement, I -- I look at history completely, which means I look at how court of appeals and district courts have been using those terms now for decades. So the question is, where does that go into your analysis? Because it's contrary -- up until the Ninth Circuit, it's basically contrary to your point. It's not because you told me you don't know what the New York statute permitted or didn't. So it's, in my mind, a wash. Well, we know in American history that attorneys' fees were considered recoverable for a long time. It's a modern phenomenon, the American rule now. So I'm not sure what to do in that in-between period, other than to look at what more recent courts are doing or not doing. Was it 1976 -- what were the courts doing in 1976? Then let me -- let me -- -- get to my problem with your interpretation. It's open-ended, so open-ended that I don't have a way for judges to exercise their discretion in a reasonable manner because, under your definition of ""full costs,"" I'm assuming the babysitter for the witness who has to come to court is covered. I'm assuming experts, which could include experts like a body language reader. What -- what would limit -- there's nothing statutorily or otherwise that would limit a judge's discretion of awarding costs. If they were caused by the suit, then, presumably, they're recoverable. But that's not how we generally deal with costs. Why did they use -- why did they use the federal rule?
