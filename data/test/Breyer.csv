2018,Bucklew v. Precythe,110,Stephen G. Breyer,"What do you do with the -- do I understand where we are is that the district court and the court of appeals assumed that you had shown enough to deny summary judgment to the state, you'd shown enough that this method, because of his special condition and the terrible tumors and so forth, could cause serious suffering, and now they overturned you on the second part and said: But you haven't shown that that serious suffering wouldn't occur anyway, even with your new method. All right? That's where we are. So, as of this moment, though, we've been talking about the first part, and even you say a lot of conditions have changed. And some had changed. And some might have changed. And we're missing a piece of evidence about an affidavit that says, hey, the nurses and so forth do what they're supposed to do. Okay? Now, as to the second part, which is pretty hard to look at alone without the first part, as to the second part, what in your opinion should we do? Because the only -- the evidence in the record said, yeah, if we use nitrogen, Doctor -- the doctor that you mentioned said you use nitrogen 20 seconds, 30 seconds, he'll -- he'll be unconscious. Okay. The Chief Justice -- I mean, that is a point; it's never been used before. And even their doctors, they're listening and -- or knows about all this and it all is on an assumption that now seems not to be accurate in your own view. The horse study's misread. And so -- so what in your opinion should the Court do? Yes. That seems to be -- what do you recommend that we do? I mean, the difficulty with the discussion to me that you're having right now is a legal difficulty, that -- that you have the district judge and the court of appeals both assuming he's made his case on this point for summary judgment purposes. And -- and you may be right, he hasn't, but it's unusual for us to go into a record like this, I think, and then reverse both courts on that. So then we're stuck with the other part of it, which we don't know all that about -- much about. And the nitrogen, they have a good reason for thinking that the nitrogen won't be painful, that it works in a different way, and yet it isn't quite there in the record and -- and -- and you can argue it and that's why there was a dissent. So what strikes me is at that part -- at that point, you should go deal with this as -- as -- as a person rather than a lawyer. Go back and hold a full hearing on it. Go back and find out if this man really is special, if there really is a special problem, what we know about the alternatives, all the questions that you've pointed out and that they've pointed out, which we don't have answers to. Now I -- I -- why not? It could. I mean, my reaction to that is a question mark. I mean, that it hasn't been tried, it's certainly a strike against it, but is it a fatal strike against it? And the other thing that's going on in the back of my mind is -- is, of course, what people do think very often is, look, once we send it back on this, then they'll think of something else. And really what's going on is endless delay because they think that the death penalty is -- is not appropriate. Okay? So can that be guarded against here? They -- they've sworn up and down, no, we're not going to do that. I mean, we're -- we're -- this is really an unusual case. And, you know, you've read all that stuff. So do you have anything you want to say about that? I thought -- I'm trying to get back to my question, which is asking you as a prosecutor, but, look, I guess you would agree that some -- X has a rare medical condition that makes the method of execution to him feel exactly like being burned at the stake. Okay? Would -- the Constitution would rule that out, wouldn't it? And -- but, yeah, he doesn't -- he has a mental condition of some kind. It makes it exactly the same. It feels exactly the same. Well, that's it. I'm making it up as I go along. (Laughter.) Okay? But what I want is -- it's exactly the same to him as if you burned him at the stake. And I guess if you're going to rule out the one, you'd rule out the other. That's my thought, because I'm going to say next he, this particular individual, will, because of his rare medical condition, feel exactly the same as if he'd been drowned to death over -- slowly over a period of time. Okay? So that's why I think Justice Kavanaugh brought that up. But my -- my -- my -- my -- and I -- and that seems to me to be the factual issue that's underlying your first point. But now we're back in the weeds with this individual. So I'm interested in your experience and as far as you read about it and know about it, what do we do about, in your opinion, 42 years in prison, 20 years in prison, 30 years in prison, and people thinking: Well, the reason is it's the courts that don't like the death penalty and, therefore, there's one thing after another and it goes on and on and on, and when we send it back here, we'll see that they'll think of a new one after this one and -- and so forth. So I -- I -- I think it's a serious question. And -- and I would like to know what you think. No, I'm not doing it that technically. I'm -- I'm doing it because this case really exhibits, as I said -- it's -- as a special case, and I think of the burning at the stake example. And I know that other people think that's just something they're going to bring up and lose or win and then they go on to the next one after that and the next one after that. And I've -- I've written and said: Well, it's because it's very hard to do this because you want to give them basic fairness. You don't want to burn someone at the stake. And that takes time. So -- so what is your take on that? My general argument. Challenge after challenge, that's -- I see that. But here is a person who has some evidence anyway that, when you execute him, it's going to be like slowly drowning him to death and there's a good chance of that. So, in your opinion, should the person, given the Eighth Amendment, not even have the right to make that argument? And if he has the right to make that argument, then how do we avoid the situation that we're in of having to decide it? And if he has the right to make the argument, that I want this alternative, how do we avoid the situation of 15 years of testing every possible method of execution? ",what do you do with the do i understand where we be be that the district court and the court of appeal assume that you have show enough to deny summary judgment to the state you would show enough that this method because of his special condition and the terrible tumor and so forth could because serious suffering and now they overturn you on the second part and say but you have not show that that serious suffer would not occur anyway even with your new method all right that be where we be so as of this moment though we have be talk about the first part and even you say a lot of condition have change and some have change and some might have change and we be miss a piece of evidence about an affidavit that say hey the nurse and so forth do what they be suppose to do okay now as to the second part which be pretty hard to look at alone without the first part as to the second part what in your opinion should we do because the only the evidence in the record say yeah if we use nitrogen

be listen and or know about all this and it all be on an assumption that now seem not to be accurate in your own view the horse study s misread and so so what in your opinion should the court do yes that seem to be what do you recommend that we do i mean the difficulty with the discussion to me that you be have right now be a legal difficulty that that you have the district judge and the court of appeal both assume he be make his case on this point for summary judgment purpose and and you may be right he have not but it be unusual for us to go into a record like this i think and then reverse

2018,Apple v. Pepper,110,Stephen G. Breyer,"Certainly, I wouldn't think that's true, even if they concluded it. And in a simple theory, I would have thought it would have been in antitrust for at least 100 years. What you do is you look to see who you claim is the monopolist. Who do they claim is the monopolist? Apple. And if you pay -- if that's true, they can raise prices to some people, lower them to others, their suppliers. And if you were injured because you paid them more, the monopolist, you can collect damages. And if you're injured because they forced your price down, you're a supplier, you can collect damages. End of theory. I don't see anything in Illinois Brick that conflicts with that. All right. What is that? Yeah. Yeah, it says that if -- I don't mean to interrupt you, but I don't want to -- you to miss the point I'm making. If Joe Smith buys from Bill, who bought from the monopolist, then we have something indirect. But, if Joe Smith bought from the monopolist, it is direct. That's a simple theory. Now I can't find in reason or in case law or in anything I've ever learned in antitrust anything that would conflict with that. And what I want you is to tell me what? You know, there are an awful lot of words in this case that I tend to have trouble understanding. One is two-sided market. Another is a lot that you used. So I go by simple analogy. If Bill buys from the monopolist, he is a direct purchaser. If Bill buys from Sam, who buys from the monopolist, he is an indirect purchaser. Anyone can understand that. And when I get into what I think of as jargon, I begin to think: Suppose I were advising United Fruit Company. I have a great idea. You won't have to torpedo the boats of your competitors anymore. Here's what you do: What you do is you buy from the farmers and you tell the farmers what you will pay the banana farmers is a very low price plus 30 percent commission. And then what you do is, when you sell to banana consumers throughout the world, you charge them that 30 percent commission, which they say is a higher price. And if -- you, United Fruit, did not become a monopolist. Now I think I'm advising Jay Rockefeller, John Rockefeller, and I give him the same advice. And I give the same advice to United Shoe, which happened to be a distribution company. And we thereby have -- well, you see the point. I wouldn't have thought that was the antitrust violation. I would have thought the antitrust violation is having enormous market power achieved by not patents and not skill, foresight, and industry but, rather, anticompetitive or more restrictive than necessary practices. Alcoa -- -- Alcoa did not charge higher than competitive prices, and that's why Learned Hand said the easy life, not necessarily higher prices, is the reward, often, of monopoly. Now -- -- I would have thought it's a matter for proof at the damages stage whether, in fact, Apple, assuming they prove it is a monopoly, has extracted higher than competitive prices from those particular people, the plaintiffs, or whether they've just had the easy life. Now I don't think that's the stage we're at in this case. So, if you say right, right, right -- -- then they must win. Have we had trial on that? Unless we're -- unless we're prepared to overrule, which wasn't our case, Alcoa, I think all you'd have to show is, one, they have monopoly power, and, two, they achieved it through less restrictive -- for more restrictive than necessary practices, end of your burden. In your case -- and -- and Justice Gorsuch is quite right, there's only one monopoly profit to be earned. And so you'd have a different question when you get to the damages stage. The different question is: Well, how did they divide that monopoly profit? You'd like to show that they got some of it from consumers. But that's for a later proceeding. And you're adding one thing. One of the things that we want to use in order to prove that they do have monopoly power, i.e., the power to raise price significantly above a competitive level, is they charge us so bloody much money. That's just a piece of evidence here, and we'll worry later, agreeing that there's only one monopoly profit in theory, as to who got what. Now have I stated that correctly? ",certainly i would not think that be true even if they conclude it and in a simple theory i would have think it would have be in antitrust for at least year what you do be you look to see who you claim be the monopolist who do they claim be the monopolist apple and if you pay if that be true they can raise price to some people low them to others their supplier and if you we be injure because you pay them more the monopolist you can collect damage and if you be injure because they force your price down you be a supplier you can collect damage end of theory i do not see anything in illinois brick that conflict with that all right what be that yeah yeah it say that if i do not mean to interrupt you but i do not want to you to miss the point I be make if joe smith buy from bill who buy from the monopolist then we have something indirect but if joe smith buy from the monopolist it be direct that be a simple theory now i can not find in reason or in case law or in anything I have ever learn in antitrust anything that would conflict with that and what i want you be to tell me what you know there be an awful lot of word in this case that i tend to have trouble understanding one be two sided market another be a lot that you use so i go by simple analogy if bill buy from the monopolist he be a direct purchaser if bill buy from sam who buy from the monopolist he be an indirect purchaser anyone can understand that and when i get into what i think of as jargon i begin to think suppose i we be advise united fruit company i have a great idea you will not have to torpedo the boat of your competitor anymore here s what you do what you do be you buy from the farmer and you tell the farmer what you will pay the banana farmer be a very low price plus percent commission and then what you do be when you sell to banana consumer throughout the world you charge them that percent commission which they say be a high price and if you united fruit do not become a monopolist now i think I be advise jay rockefeller john rockefeller and i give him the same advice and i give the same advice to united shoe which happen to be a distribution company and we thereby have well you see the point i would not have think that be the antitrust violation i would have think the antitrust violation be have enormous market power achieve by not patent and not skill foresight and industry but rather anticompetitive or more restrictive than necessary practice alcoa alcoa do not charge high than competitive price and that be why learned hand say the easy life not necessarily high price be the reward often of monopoly now i would have think it be a matter for proof at the damage stage whether in fact apple assume they prove it be a monopoly have extract high than competitive price from those particular people the plaintiff or whether they have just have the easy life now i do not think that be the stage we be at in this case so if you say right right right then they must win have we have trial on that unless we be unless we be prepared to overrule which be not our case alcoa i think all you would have to show be one they have monopoly power and two they achieve it through less restrictive for more restrictive than necessary practice end of your burden in your case and and justice gorsuch be quite right there be only one monopoly profit to be earn and so you would have a different question when you get to the damage stage the different question be well how do they divide that monopoly profit you would like to show that they get some of it from consumer but that be for a late proceeding and you be add one thing one of the thing that we want to use in order to prove that they do have monopoly power ie the power to raise price significantly above a competitive level be they charge us so bloody much money that be just a piece of evidence here and we will worry later agree that there be only one monopoly profit in theory as to who get what now have i state that correctly ,293.2799999999998,Case pending,"Nov 26, 2018","Apple, Inc.","Robert Pepper, et al.",17-204,"Jun 18, 2018",,110.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2018,"Mission Product Holdings, Inc. v. Tempnology, LLC",110,Stephen G. Breyer,"Do you want -- do you want -- are you -- I mean, the main question that I have, I think, is the same that Justice Alito and Justice Kagan had -- -- where I think -- well, let me show you. Where I think this comes from an article by Professor Andrews, and he says, look, I'm the debtor, you're the licensee, but say you leased a house. There are two assets here; one is the house, which you've leased, and the other is a promise by me to replace the windows. All right? So, if you can analogize it to that, you win. Well, the more I think about it, I'm not sure. Why? A, there are a lot of special provisions in the trademark law and in bankruptcy law about houses and leases. B, it's really a special kind of house. It's like a house that would collapse unless you keep it up; maybe like an igloo that you promised to air condition. You know, you break your promise to air condition, no more igloo. Now, if you seem to think of it like that, you think, no, there aren't two rights. This upkeep business is an essential part of one right, which is going to give you the house to live in. So I -- I -- I -- so I had -- I would like you or Ms. Spinelli or, you know -- -- at some point to tell me which is the strong -- why is it stronger when -- Yeah. All right. It's a day before bankruptcy. Nobody knows bankruptcy's going to take place. I am the holder of a trademark. I have leased it to you, and you can use it for 10 years, and I assume certain obligations. And I write you a letter. You say, ha, ha, ha, I'm not going to do it. Which is a material breach of the contract. Now you bring a lawsuit, the day before, and you say: Judge, you know, I want to keep the leased good, which could be anything, jewels for a costume company, you know -- I don't know about igloos, but -- but -- but nonetheless, you say it could be anything. Okay. What's the law? Can I keep it or not keep it? Now, when you say ""in -- in -- in your view,"" I already stop you because it's amazing to me that there is no authority that's more on point than this real estate stuff, which, as you say, is absolutely filled with writings in the statute. All right, but -- so -- so you say ""in your view,"" that means you're not certain? MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I -- I don't think that there's -- there's case law that's clear on this -- JUSTICE BREYER: No? No, I'm not talking about trademarks. Let's -- necessarily, but -- but, gee, I mean, they've had property law for 500 years and people have breached for 500 years. And -- Well, no, okay, but there -- Okay. You can't think of any analogy or anything that would tell us when you walk in the day before, say nobody knows about bankruptcy, and you say Breyer has breached the contract -- -- but I want to keep the property. There's just no good case that would help me? Anything that you think is analogous. Okay. If that's -- No. And then -- -- you see then -- then the argument really turns down to, which is where I sort of felt after reading the briefs, well, is this continuous obligation to keep the trademark going, which is on me, the breacher, is that enough? And at that point, I become uncertain. And one of the things cutting against you is that the licensee can keep up the trademark himself. I don't know if that's enough. So have you found anything that would really help me? Right. All right. That may be, but there are thousands of McDonald's, I guess, firms that have leased the word ""McDonald."" And if one of -- if somehow super McDonald went bankrupt, couldn't those trustees say the people in this neighborhood trust me to have real McDonald's, and what I'll do is I will look at every hamburger and I will make certain that -- that these hamburgers are exactly the same as they were when McDonald was still alive or whatever. Now he doesn't have a right to do that? Because I got the impression in the other briefs he does. Yeah. What happens? But what happens to an abandoned trademark? Can you use an abandoned trademark? No. Can a person -- Can -- He can, okay. If he can, and here we're dealing with non-exclusive licenses, why isn't that his problem? Let me -- let me be sure I'm not missing something. Forget bankruptcy. Think of contract law over the course of the centuries, all right? Now, as I started out, A breaches a provision. The ordinary rule is B can keep the property that he's got if he wants. Isn't that the ordinary rule? But then there are lots -- there should be lots of not ordinary cases. There should be lots of cases where, maybe not like igloos, but the property is severely injured, disappears, dah-dah-dah, unless the breachor keeps it up. And in those non-bankruptcy cases, what happens? Does he -- does he -- does -- does he -- what happens? Yeah. One quick question and then there's your third. But -- but -- and, look, outside of bankruptcy or in general, you lease, the lessor leases a trademark to the lessee. Lessor doesn't keep it up, doesn't quality control. Does that stick, which is now in the hands of the lessee, dissolve, disappear -- -- gone? ",do you want do you want be you i mean the main question that i have i think be the same that justice alito and justice kagan have where i think well let me show you where i think this come from an article by professor andrew and he say look I be the debtor you be the licensee but say you lease a house there be two asset here one be the house which you have lease and the other be a promise by me to replace the window all right so if you can analogize it to that you win well the more i think about it I be not sure why a there be a lot of special provision in the trademark law and in bankruptcy law about house and lease b it be really a special kind of house it be like a house that would collapse unless you keep it up maybe like an igloo that you promise to air condition you know you break your promise to air condition no more igloo now if you seem to think of it like that you think no there be not two right this upkeep business be an essential part of one right which be go to give you the house to live in so i i i so i have i would like you or ms spinelli or you know at some point to tell me which be the strong why be it strong when yeah all right it be a day before bankruptcy nobody know bankruptcy s go to take place i be the holder of a trademark i have lease it to you and you can use it for year and i assume certain obligation and i write you a letter you say ha ha ha I be not go to do it which be a material breach of the contract now you bring a lawsuit the day before and you say judge you know i want to keep the lease good which could be anything jewel for a costume company you know i do not know about igloo but but but nonetheless you say it could be anything okay what be the law can i keep it or not keep it now when you say in in in your view i already stop you because it be amaze to me that there be no authority that be more on point than this real estate stuff which as you say be absolutely fill with writing in the statute all right but so so you say in your view that mean you be not certain mr hallward driemeier well i i do not think that there be there be case law that be clear on this justice breyer no no I be not talk about trademark let us necessarily but but gee i mean they have have property law for year and people have breach for year and well no okay but there okay you can not think of any analogy or anything that would tell us when you walk in the day before say nobody know about bankruptcy and you say breyer have breach the contract but i want to keep the property there be just no good case that would help me anything that you think be analogous okay if that be no and then you see then then the argument really turn down to which be where i sort of felt after read the brief well be this continuous obligation to keep the trademark go which be on me the breacher be that enough and at that point i become uncertain and one of the thing cut against you be that the licensee can keep up the trademark himself i do not know if that be enough so have you find anything that would really help me right all right that may be but there be thousand of mcdonald s i guess firm that have lease the word mcdonald and if one of if somehow super mcdonald go bankrupt could not those trustee say the people in this neighborhood trust me to have real mcdonald s and what I will do be i will look at every hamburger and i will make certain that that these hamburger be exactly the same as they we be when mcdonald be still alive or whatever now he do not have a right to do that because i get the impression in the other brief he do yeah what happen but what happen to an abandon trademark can you use an abandon trademark no can a person can he can okay if he can and here we be deal with non exclusive license why be not that his problem let me let me be sure I be not miss something forget bankruptcy think of contract law over the course of the century all right now as i start out a breach a provision the ordinary rule be b can keep the property that he be got if he want be not that the ordinary rule but then there be lot there should be lot of not ordinary case there should be lot of case where maybe not like igloo but the property be severely injured disappears dah dah dah unless the breachor keep it up and in those non bankruptcy case what happen do he do he do do he what happen yeah one quick question and then there be your third but but and look outside of bankruptcy or in general you lease the lessor lease a trademark to the lessee lessor do not keep it up do not quality control do that stick which be now in the hand of the lessee dissolve disappear go ,357.72000000000014,Case pending,"Feb 20, 2019","Mission Product Holdings, Inc.","Tempnology, LLC",17-1657,"Oct 26, 2018",,110.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2018,"Washington State Department of Licensing v. Cougar Den, Inc.",110,Stephen G. Breyer,"Assume I think you're mostly right, but what about the fact that it's gasoline? I mean, can -- can the state impose tolls on -- on the highway? Say they really want people to use mass transit. We're going to have a $1,000 toll. Can they do that? Yes, doing it for everybody. Now, by the way, nobody, or hardly anyone, can use the highways, including the tribe. I believe that they are unlikely to impose it. That's why it's a hypothetical. No, no, everyone has to pay the thousand. Including the tribe. And then, if you were going to say they can do that, I really do find it difficult to distinguish this issue. There could? No, no, it's $1,000, and, of course, as soon as you agree to that, I'm going to say it's only 50, and then I'm going to say it's 10. And then, when I'm driving up, I would have thought they can't do that, but if they can't do that, this is gasoline. And maybe all those Oregon and -- and California and other places and everybody pays it, that's true, but if you pay a high gasoline tax, it's pretty hard to travel. And they're supposed to be able to travel on the highway, just as if you get all the salmon out of the river, it's pretty hard to fish. In Oregon, you say that they have -- they cannot take steps to remove significant numbers of salmon from the steam -- stream, and they cannot take steps sufficient to significantly limit the right to travel on the highway by these people. Do what you want for the other citizens. How much is the tax? How much is the tax? I know you don't think it's relevant, but if I happened to think it was relevant and asked the question how much is the tax, what would the answer be? You don't know? But they didn't make any of these arguments. The -- the thing I don't understand is that many states have laws against bringing in diseased apples, all kinds of things. All right? So, if they don't bring it in, you can't transport it at all. So, if your point is that they have a right to transport things, I would have thought you would have said a ban was worse because -- but you don't. You say a ban is okay, but a tax isn't. That's your argument? Okay. Now, if you tax what they do in this state, is they have a tax that says if you buy goods to use in your house somewhere else, you have to -- you have to pay a use tax when you bring it into our state. And then another state says we're going to legalize marijuana, but we tax it pretty high, and another state says we have -- you know, I can go on and on and on. And you're saying, well, this tribe, it doesn't have to pay the tax on marijuana. It doesn't have to pay the ordinary sales tax, which take the form of a use tax in the state. And I could probably think of 10 other examples. And, my goodness, I say why -- why not? Is that your position, what I said? Good. Now, fine. I'm glad it isn't because my own position I had a good argument against. (Laughter.) But I'd like -- I'd like -- like to -- I'd like to know what your position is then. So especially for gas? I didn't see that in your brief. I put the argument to them and I just didn't see that in your brief that you were saying but a tax on gas interferes with transportation. That's not your argument either. Okay. What is your argument? What do you mean the transportation? Does it say it taxes the transportation? It does? You know the statute better than I. Does the statute say we impose a tax on the transportation of gasoline? What's the answer, yes or no? What is the word? No, what is the word of the statute? You get a tax. A tax is imposed when a good enters. A tax is imposed of 90 percent when marijuana enters this state, and you just told me that would be okay. An importer of marijuana must pay a tax of 90 percent. You say that is legal or illegal? I just -- what I just said. Is it legal or illegal? You heard what I said. A tax -- the statute says a tax on marijuana is imposed. Now what were the words you used -- I wanted to use the same ones -- upon entry of the marijuana into the state. That's all. I'm just trying to -- All right. So now what you're claiming is that -- and this is what's bothering me and I'm trying to get to it -- you're saying that the tribe, unlike anyone else in the state, can refuse to pay taxes that really have nothing to do with transportation but have to do with drug regulation, which have to do with keeping certain bad things out, which have to do with raising money for other reasons. Now that -- you see what I'm saying? I'm saying the common sense of it is why would this treaty give a tribe the right not to pay taxes that have really nothing to do with transportation, that's just the way, et cetera. Yes. All right. It doesn't say transportation. It says bulk entry or something like that, non-bulk entry. And what I'm actually bothered about is people are going to buy millions of things online. And so a state says the following: We just want our sales tax. And so they pass a statute that looks like this. When something you've bought online enters into the state, a tax is due. You know, that's pretty close to this statute. And what I'm having trouble is seeing how your argument -- that's why I have this other argument, where it's just fuel. But you don't accept that. Okay. How your argument would permit the state to -- it would deny the state the right to tax the Indian tribe when they've done what everybody else has done, just bought things online, and they haven't yet paid the use tax or haven't yet paid the comparable sales tax. Now that's what's really bothering me. And -- and if you can give me a minute or so on that, I would be helped. I'm not talking about non-Indians. I'm talking about the Indian consumers. I've now read the statute again, and it seems there are four relevant words. The tax on fuel applies when the fuel ""enters into this state."" And now all I have to do is substitute for the word ""fuel"" things bought online, which could be anything at all, and then we can have diseased things or I don't know what, marijuana, and you are saying -- and I think you are saying this -- that this statute, which had to do with travel on the roads, applies to all those things as long as they use the words ""the tax applies when it enters into this state."" Now I hope I'm wrong -- or maybe I'm right -- I don't know. I want to hear your answer. Yes, it also, by the way, has to be the case that it goes by FedEx or it goes by UPS or it goes by a truck or something like that. It can't just go by an airplane and be delivered by a drone. I've got that. Now what else? ",assume i think you be mostly right but what about the fact that it be gasoline i mean can can the state impose toll on on the highway say they really want people to use mass transit we be go to have a toll can they do that yes do it for everybody now by the way nobody or hardly anyone can use the highway include the tribe i believe that they be unlikely to impose it that be why it be a hypothetical no no everyone have to pay the thousand include the tribe and then if you we be go to say they can do that i really do find it difficult to distinguish this issue there could no no it be and of course as soon as you agree to that I be go to say it be only and then I be go to say it be and then when I be drive up i would have think they can not do that but if they can not do that this be gasoline and maybe all those oregon and and california and other place and everybody pay it that be true but if you pay a high gasoline tax it be pretty hard to travel and they be suppose to be able to travel on the highway just as if you get all the salmon out of the river it be pretty hard to fish in oregon you say that they have they can not take step to remove significant number of salmon from the steam stream and they can not take step sufficient to significantly limit the right to travel on the highway by these people do what you want for the other citizen how much be the tax how much be the tax i know you do not think it be relevant but if i happen to think it be relevant and ask the question how much be the tax what would the answer be you do not know but they do not make any of these argument the the thing i do not understand be that many state have law against bring in diseased apple all kind of thing all right so if they do not bring it in you can not transport it at all so if your point be that they have a right to transport thing i would have think you would have say a ban be bad because but you do not you say a ban be okay but a tax be not that be your argument okay now if you tax what they do in this state be they have a tax that say if you buy good to use in your house somewhere else you have to you have to pay a use tax when you bring it into our state and then another state say we be go to legalize marijuana but we tax it pretty high and another state say we have you know i can go on and on and on and you be say well this tribe it do not have to pay the tax on marijuana it do not have to pay the ordinary sale tax which take the form of a use tax in the state and i could probably think of other example and my goodness i say why why not be that your position what i say good now fine I be glad it be not because my own position i have a good argument against laughter but I would like I would like like to I would like to know what your position be then so especially for gas i do not see that in your brief i put the argument to them and i just do not see that in your brief that you we be say but a tax on gas interferes with transportation that be not your argument either okay what be your argument what do you mean the transportation do it say it tax the transportation it do you know the statute good than i do the statute say we impose a tax on the transportation of gasoline what be the answer yes or no what be the word no what be the word of the statute you get a tax a tax be impose when a good enters a tax be impose of percent when marijuana enters this state and you just tell me that would be okay an importer of marijuana must pay a tax of percent you say that be legal or illegal i just what i just say be it legal or illegal you hear what i say a tax the statute say a tax on marijuana be impose now what we be the word you use i want to use the same one upon entry of the marijuana into the state that be all I be just try to all right so now what you be claim be that and this be what be bother me and I be try to get to it you be say that the tribe unlike anyone else in the state can refuse to pay tax that really have nothing to do with transportation but have to do with drug regulation which have to do with keep certain bad thing out which have to do with raise money for other reason now that you see what I be say I be say the common sense of it be why would this treaty give a tribe the right not to pay tax that have really nothing to do with transportation that be just the way et cetera yes all right it do not say transportation it say bulk entry or something like that non bulk entry and what I be actually bother about be people be go to buy million of thing online and so a state say the following we just want our sale tax and so they pass a statute that look like this when something you have buy online enters into the state a tax be due you know that be pretty close to this statute

deny the state the right to tax the indian tribe when they have do what everybody else have do just buy thing online and they have not yet pay the use tax or have not yet pay the comparable sale tax now that be what be really bother me and and if you can give me a minute or so on that i would be help I be not talk about non indian I be talk about the indian consumer I have now read the statute again and it seem there be four relevant word the tax on fuel applies when the fuel enters into this state and now all i have to do be substitute for the word fuel thing buy online which could be

2018,Dawson v. Steager,110,Stephen G. Breyer,"Suppose what -- suppose that the person who's drafting this bill for the state is trying to -- they think that the police officers and the others really -- they aren't paid very much and it's a particularly dangerous job, and you know those characteristics, so -- so they think they should give them a tax break. And then someone says, well, what about the federal marshals, they do the same thing? And then the person replies: Yes, they do, but they get paid a lot more, you see. And so the feds pay them a lot more than we pay the state people. So that's why we're doing it. Okay? Is that okay or not? I'm not sure. A reason, I -- I think, it's you can't do this, it seems to me, except in a very crude basis because there -- there's dozens of differences between state employees, federal employees. They categorize them differently. They have slightly different jobs. If you're going to start looking at an individual basis, you just don't know. So why don't we take literally what it says? Is it the source of income? Period. I mean, did it come from the feds? And if it does come from the feds, and they pay less in roughly similar categories, you can't get beyond roughly, that's the end of it. So we don't see whether, in fact, the feds are being paid more. We don't see, in fact, whether there's some other thing that -- that distinguishes why you wanted to give this break to the state police. You have here virtually all the state police. They're in this, so they have the right to it. It's not just the state police. It's also the local police. It's everybody in law enforcement almost. And they can get into it and the feds can't. Why isn't that just the end of it? It's not? I had it actually there was federal, there -- sorry, there were the state people, the sheriffs, the head sheriffs, the local policemen, that's where I thought -- and it says -- I thought I read that it said that they were eligible. They're not? And who decides? Who decides, whether I am a firefighter or a local policeman, who decides which plan I join? Who? No, I don't understand. I want an answer to the question. (Laughter.) Yeah. So the individual policeman can't decide? It has to be a vote or a -- a municipality? So how many local police are roughly in this program and how many local police aren't? You can't give them to me at all? Okay. So what is it? What is it? I mean, what is it that the -- the 20 towns with the police and the state sheriffs and the state deputy sheriffs and all these different -- what is it they do that the federal marshals don't do? That sounds like you're saying we discriminate on the basis of source. Yeah. But what you say is let's look at the state plan here and let's look at the federal plan. So you're saying they're the same people. They do the same thing. Is there discrimination? And you just seem to me to say: No, but the other side says, hey, they get a tax break and we don't. Now that sounds like discrimination. I mean, it may be justified or whatever it is. But the question is, is there discrimination? How do you explain that? Ah, that's the nub of this, it seemed to me, that -- that -- is it the case that if the state never thought of this, it wasn't against the marshals; it just developed a system that meant that they have a lot more money -- less money in their pocket than comparable state. Does that violate the statute? Now I thought the answer to that question is yes, it does violate the statute. Don't look into the state's actual reasons; just look into whether they end up with less money in their pocket and they're just -- maybe you could say a justification, but the justification can't be, well, we have a set of complicated retirement systems that pays the state people even more. I began to see this as a different issue than I had initially thought. So don't say I'm right if I'm wrong. Okay? And if I'm off base, just say it. But the statute says you cannot tax the pay of a -- or compensation of a federal official if the tax -- unless the tax does not discriminate because of the source of the pay or compensation. Okay. So then we have some money that the marshals get. And they put that money into a federal fund, which is a retirement fund. And the state in its taxation discriminates against them, but not because of their pay or compensation, but, rather, because of the nature of the retirement fund that they put it in. Is that what you're saying? Okay. So where did I get -- I didn't -- for some reason, it's not necessarily your fault, but I -- this is a fairly simple point. Look at the retirement fund, and if that's the basis for the discrimination against the federal employees, that's fine. That isn't their pay or compensation. And -- and that's what we should be looking at? Is that right? Then I didn't get that out of the brief too well, but maybe that's my fault. Okay. ",suppose what suppose that the person who be draft this bill for the state be try to they think that the police officer and the others really they be not pay very much and it be a particularly dangerous job and you know those characteristic so so they think they should give them a tax break and then someone say well what about the federal marshal they do the same thing and then the person reply yes they do but they get pay a lot more you see and so the fed pay them a lot more than we pay the state people so that be why we be do it okay be that okay or not I be not sure a reason i i think it be you can not do this it seem to me except in a very crude basis because there there have dozen of difference between state employee federal employee they categorize them differently they have slightly different job if you be go to start look at an individual basis you just do not know so why do not we take literally what it say be it the source of income period i mean do it come from the fed and if it do come from the fed and they pay less in roughly similar category you can not get beyond roughly that be the end of it so we do not see whether in fact the fed be be pay more we do not see in fact whether there be some other thing that that distinguish why you want to give this break to the state police you have here virtually all the state police they be in this so they have the right to it it be not just the state police it be also the local police it be everybody in law enforcement almost and they can get into it and the fed can not why be not that just the end of it it be not i have it actually there be federal there sorry there we be the state people the sheriff the head sheriff the local policeman that be where i thought and it say i think i read that it say that they we be eligible they be not and who decide who decide whether i be a firefighter or a local policeman who decide which plan i join who no i do not understand i want an answer to the question laughter yeah so the individual policeman can not decide it have to be a vote or a a municipality so how many local police be roughly in this program and how many local police be not you can not give them to me at all okay so what be it what be it i mean what be it that the the town with the police and the state sheriff and the state deputy sheriff and all these different what be it they do that the federal marshal do not do that sound like you be say we discriminate on the basis of source yeah but what you say be let us look at the state plan here and let us look at the federal plan so you be say they be the same people they do the same thing be there discrimination and you just seem to me to say no but the other side say hey they get a tax break and we do not now that sound like discrimination i mean it may be justify or whatever it be but the question be be there discrimination how do you explain that ah that be the nub of this it seem to me that that be it the case that if the state never think of this it be not against the marshal it just develop a system that mean that they have a lot more money less money in their pocket than comparable state do that violate the statute now i think the answer to that question be yes it do violate the statute do not look into the state s actual reason just look into whether they end up with less money in their pocket and they be just maybe you could say a justification but the justification can not be well we have a set of complicated retirement system that pay the state people even more i begin to see this as a different issue than i have initially think so do not say I be right if I be wrong okay and if I be off base just say it but the statute say you can not tax the pay of a or compensation of a federal official if the tax unless the tax do not discriminate because of the source of the pay or compensation okay so then we have some money that the marshal get and they put that money into a federal fund which be a retirement fund and the state in its taxation discriminates against them but not because of their pay or compensation but rather because of the nature of the retirement fund that they put it in be that what you be say okay so where do i get i do not for some reason it be not necessarily your fault but i this be a fairly simple point look at the retirement fund and if that be the basis for the discrimination against the federal employee that be fine that be not their pay or compensation and and that be what we should be look at be that right then i do not get that out of the brief too well but maybe that be my fault okay ,312.8400000000001,Roberts Court,"Dec 3, 2018","James Dawson, et ux.","Dale W.

2018,Manhattan Community Access Corp. v. Halleck,110,Stephen G. Breyer,"Sorry, were you finished? Look, your brief, the PSC regulations require that content on public access channels be ""non-commercial"" and that access must be ""on a first-come, first-served non-discriminatory basis."" So what is your discretion? And that's what you say. So -- -- so what is your discretion? Well, put -- putting shows on Channel 14 rather than Channel 16 wouldn't seem like relevant discretion, would it? I mean, what's broadcast out, whether it's 14 or 16, is absolutely determined by this rule. At least that's how I read your brief to say it. All right. There's another question then that I have -- -- which I can't get out of the brief. There are 13 directors, right? And two of them are chosen by the government? How are the other 13 chosen? Eleven, yeah. And who creates the nominating committee? So -- but why -- then that's your -- the -- the -- it's a self-perpetuating board? The other members are chosen by a nominating committee. The nominating committee is selected by the Board. I think this would help you. And only two of the members are actually chosen by the government. Are the other 11 members governmental people or have no governmental connection? Well, why didn't you put that in the brief? Did you put that in your brief? What is the -- the -- the -- All right. But -- but assume I -- I can read the cases. What I can't do is figure out what the facts are. And so that's what I'm focusing on. It's now -- do you have this power: At 5 p.m., something will be broadcast over your channel. Okay? Do you have the power to say this evening we wish to discuss subways; tomorrow at 4:00, we will discuss the public schools? All right. Do you have that power? Or, if we have one speaker who wants to talk about public schools and another one who wants to talk about subways, they have to go in whatever jumble they want, so people can't figure out the issues because there are 40,000 issues in New York, and do we have a general conversation about all of them at once, or do you have the power to order that? Shows. Look, first-come, first-served, tell me if I'm wrong, in my mind, is there 40,000 issues, people can discuss them in any order, and anyone who wants to come up and broadcast can discuss any issue, and you have no power to change that, or you do have the power to organize it and have first a subway discussion, then another discussion. Which is it? What -- to what degree? (Laughter.) That doesn't help me. You see, I have a simple factual question. Tomorrow I want to go and interrupt somebody who's in the subway discussion. As soon as he's finished, I want to discuss New York and hot dogs, okay? Now do you have to let me, yes or no? Well, somebody else has submitted a tape that they'd like to discuss schools. So I am third. That -- that's a factual question. What is it? All right. But I -- I will come third. First-come, first-served, is that right? So it has to be a jumble? Of course -- of course, it might be coincidence that it isn't -- -- but you have no power not to make it a jumble? What? Well, a prison, for example? I don't -- I mean, my goodness. Suppose that General Motors decides that cars are controversial, and they want to do something good for the city, so they open their offices somewhere, an auditorium for everybody to speak, and they say it'll be first-come, first-served. I mean, that wouldn't make General Motors a public entity. All right. Now what I have written down here, and I want to be sure I'm not missing something. That these are the features that they -- that -- that lead someone to say it's not governmental or it is. All right? One, the basic obligation is created by law. That's on your side. All right. Two, there are two appointed public directors, but there are 11 who are not and are members of the community. That seems to cut against you. Three, it's paid for -- the cost is paid for by the private entity but under government compulsion. I don't know. I think that cuts for you. Four, that there isn't much discretion in respect to what they run, but there is some. They can decide subject matters as long as they give people a fair chance. And, five, which is not part of that, but I'd love to hear what you have to say about it, is there is for you a state remedy, and, moreover, the existence and nature of that state remedy is linked to the strength of your basic argument here. And so I am in a -- I'm -- I'm not taking a side or the other. I'm suggesting that I am genuinely uncertain about this, and I brought out the issues to try to get you to focus on them. Editorial control. See, here is -- if I think back, maybe you can help me with this. Looking at it in a broader way and saying that the First Amendment is interested in a multiplicity of ideas, a multiplicity, that's the marketplace idea, now I don't know which way to go. I'm sure one thing that would help in this direction is having some channels, such as first-come, first-served. But I also think people might turn those off and another way to do it is to allow a lot of different Internet owners or Internet providers or et cetera, et cetera, to choose a lot of different ways, and they will have different views. Maybe there should be a mix of ways of bringing different views to the public. And I'm frightened in deciding for you that it would be too rigid, and before you know it, everybody, where there's something that looks like a public forum run by private companies, would have the kind of access that you may well have here. You see, that's -- so -- so what do you -- have you ever thought about that? What is the -- It's not so modest, because it seems to me what would make sense here is that you have to go to the state. You're claiming that you come here because there is the very obligation that you want, imposed by state law and the state. And that's the reason you're up here. But I don't know of any doctrine -- this is on your side. I mean, I don't know of any doctrine that says that you have to go to the state. And, therefore, we're not -- I had Justice Alito's problem. I think that was his problem. You're right if and only if you have an excellent state cause of action. Yeah. Go back to Justice Sotomayor for a question. You said you didn't have a suit against the city. But what about a suit or some kind of administrative proceeding against M -- is it MNN, whatever you call it -- how do you -- MM? MNN. Did you have an action against them, either administratively, it would be on the ground that they're not administering the first-come, first-served policy, or in a state court? No, no, but I want to know what you think on this, because it could be that this rule, first-come, first-served, is just hortatory, if there's no remedy for it. Or a violation of it. You're saying they violated it. All right. What's your remedy? And if there's no remedy, what kind of a rule is it? I'm your client. Do I have a remedy in state court or not? What are the odds? Talk more -- But it's not so clearly different because, in the United States, there are vast numbers of different kinds of arrangements between government and private people, ranging from agency to General Motors. And, of course, if you say public park, if that's what it is, you win in my opinion. Okay. But it's not. And is it Southern Pacific Railroad, which was regulated for many years? And what am I getting into? You see, that -- that's such a general question, and I don't know if you have a thought on that. ",sorry we be you finish look your brief the psc regulation require that content on public access channel be non commercial and that access must be on a first come first serve non discriminatory basis so what be your discretion and that be what you say so so what be your discretion well put put show on channel rather than channel would not seem like relevant discretion would it i mean what be broadcast out whether it be or be absolutely determine by this rule at least that be how i read your brief to say it all right there be another question then that i have which i can not get out of the brief there be director right and two of them be choose by the government how be the other choose eleven yeah and who create the nominating committee so but why then that be your the the it be a self perpetuate board the other member be choose by a nominating committee the nominating committee be select by the board i think this would help you and only two of the member be actually choose by the government be the other member governmental people or have no governmental connection well why do not you put that in the brief do you put that in your brief what be the the the all right but but assume i i can read the case what i can not do be figure out what the fact be and so that be what I be focus on it be now do you have this power at pm something will be broadcast over your channel okay do you have the power to say this evening we wish to discuss subway tomorrow at we will discuss the public school all right do you have that power or if we have one speaker who want to talk about public school and another one who want to talk about subway they have to go in whatever jumble they want so people can not figure out the issue because there be issue in new york and do we have a general conversation about all of them at once or do you have the power to order that show look first come first serve tell me if I be wrong in my mind be there issue people can discuss them in any order and anyone who want to come up and broadcast can discuss any issue and you have no power to change that or you do have the power to organize it and have first a subway discussion then another discussion which be it what to what degree laughter that do not help me you see i have a simple factual question tomorrow i want to go and interrupt somebody who be in the subway discussion as soon as he be finish i want to discuss new york and hot dog okay now do you have to let me yes or no well somebody else have submit a tape that they would like to discuss school so i be third that that be a factual question what be it all right but i i will come third first come first serve be that right so it have to be a jumble of course of course it might be coincidence that it be not but you have no power not to make it a jumble what well a prison for example i do not i mean my goodness suppose that general motor decide that car be controversial and they want to do something good for the city so they open their office somewhere an auditorium for everybody to speak and they say it will be first come first serve i mean that would not make general motor a public entity all right now what i have write down here and i want to be sure I be not miss something that these be the feature that they that that lead someone to say it be not governmental or it be all right one the basic obligation be

call it how do you mm mnn do you have an action against them either administratively it would be on the ground that they be not administer the first come first serve policy or in a state court no no but i want to know what you think on this because it could be that this rule first come first serve be just hortatory if there be no remedy for it or a violation of it you be say they violate it all right what be your remedy and if there be no remedy what kind of a rule be it I be your client do i have a remedy in state court or not what be the odds talk more but it be not so clearly different because in the united state there be vast number of different kind of arrangement between government and private people range from agency to general motor and of course if you say public park if that be what it be you win in my opinion okay but it be not and be it southern pacific railroad which be regulate for many year and what be i get into you see that that be such a general question and i do not know if you have a think on that ,521.3699999999999,Case pending,"Feb 25, 2019","Manhattan Community Access Corporation, et al.","Deedee Halleck, et al.",17-1702,"Oct 12,

Well, there may be more. There may be fewer. What do you think of saying, yes, look at the historical context here? History counts. And so, yes, okay, but no more. That's what Justice Ginsburg, I think, was bringing up. But no more. We're a different country. We are a different country now, and there are 50 more different religions, and, therefore, no more. We're not going to have people trying to tear down historical monuments even here, okay? Now what do you think of that? I'm not suggesting I'm for it. I want to know what you think of it. It's not just an argument. It's -- it's partly guidance. I don't know if we can. This is a tough area. Okay.

2018,Mont v. United States,110,Stephen G. Breyer,"Why? I mean, it doesn't say judgment of conviction. And quite often, after the prisoner or offender issues a guilty plea, he says I'm guilty, and a jury may find him guilty, and sentencing may not take place for months, and, when it finally does, then the judgment will enter. Now why isn't his being in jail, once he's pleaded guilty or once the jury has convicted him, why is that not in connection with a conviction? Where -- where is that? It doesn't say it in the language. So -- -- so where -- where do you get that from? I know that's what you think. But I'm -- I'm simply asking what support do you have for that, because it doesn't say it? That's also true after a judgment of conviction enters. You might be released on bond pending appeal. The inquiry doesn't, but why don't you read the sentence as you think it really means it? Just read the sentence as you think it means it. No, no, don't tell me what it means. Read it so that the language embodies what you think. Well, I mean, no matter how I read it, okay, in which the person is imprisoned in connection with a conviction. He wasn't. He was imprisoned in connection with suspicion, probable cause, whatever the standard is that he has committed a crime. That's not a conviction. So what I want you to do is read it, past, present, or future, in a way that embodies what you think. My problem is I think it's unambiguous. And -- and this is the only way I can think of how to write it, would have been in connection with a crime in respect to which he was later convicted. That'll do it. I mean, that's -- that's -- but you wouldn't say -- you see -- you see, that's why I'm looking. The Chief has come pretty close. But I -- What -- what -- what would you want to say, if anything? Imagine you lose everything. The last desperate point will decide it, and it says conviction. Now your -- your co-counsel argues ""conviction"" means the entry of a judgment of conviction, not when you plead guilty and not before a sentencing or if at trial. What would you say in response to that?

2018,Timbs v. Indiana,110,Stephen G. Breyer,"What is the situation with jail, prison? I have a vague recollection -- often such recollections are incorrect -- (Laughter.) -- but I have a vague recollection that there was a case in which California's three-strike law was applied to sentence to life a person whose final offense was stealing an $80 golf club. And I think the majority said, no, we're not going to look at that because it's too complicated. Am I right? Does that ring a bell? Because if -- if that still is the law, which I think it is, it's something anomalous about saying, by the way, if you took his Mercedes, we will look to see whether that's disproportionate to taking a golf club, but if you send him to jail for life, we won't. Now have -- have I stated this correctly and, if so, how do we -- how do we deal with it? My question really is, are there cases where we have said that the punishment is disproportionate, where it's simply a question of the degree of punishment, i.e., life imprisonment, and the nature of the offense, e.g., stealing a golf club? And do you see what I -- I'm not sure there are, and, if there are not, it seems odd, and I think I'd have to think about it, or maybe we should address in some way your argument, as to why there is that difference. Am I right, you're saying there is a difference? Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah, he had a history. Yeah. He also robbed a chicken coop. (Laughter.) Well, in your view, an in rem civil forfeiture is not an excessive fine, is that right? So what is to happen if a state needing revenue says anyone who speeds has to forfeit the Bugatti, Mercedes, or a special Ferrari or even jalopy? (Laughter.) That isn't a problem because it was the Bugatti in which he was speeding. (Laughter.) So -- so there is all the nexus. Now I just wonder, what -- what is it? What is it? That -- is that just permissible under the Constitution? Yeah, and, by the way, it was only five miles an hour -- -- above the speed limit. Is it yes? It is forfeitable?

2018,"Rimini Street, Inc. v. Oracle USA, Inc.",110,Stephen G. Breyer,"Is there a -- I read in the briefs, and I don't fully -- I want to be certain I grasped the argument, that there was a period of time many, many, many years ago when a court in awarding costs, a federal court, would look to state statutes, and the state statutes provided different amounts and didn't just repeat what we have today. And then I thought that you had argued that, well, the word ""full costs"" means don't just look -- there are other things they don't look to the state statutes, but if state statute A awarded 33 cents and state statute B awarded $4,000, it would mean that you go and look to the actual cost. What is that? That's what I'm trying to find out. Could you help me with just a fact, which may or may not be relevant, but in the SG's brief, the costs that you were searching was about $5 million. That's your view of what they're entitled to. Three and a half million now? All right. Three and a half. And what they want is 17 and a half million. Does that 17 and a half million include attorneys' fees? All right. So it's 20 million in attorneys' fees. It's three and a half million in everybody concedes. Yeah, and then they want an additional 17.6 million more? All right. So they -- so it's 12.8 plus -- this is -- this is a big amount here -- so it's about 32, $35 million in costs. And what was the damage award? All right. Now I don't know if that's relevant, but it does seem a problem, if not in this case. But what -- what -- what -- what -- what is this -- somehow there's something odd about this, but -- but I -- but I don't know what. Well, maybe. I mean, they spent the money. They might have gotten more. Okay. What do you say to, is there -- is there anything that will help me, and I might be unique in this, but I -- I often think that Congress when it uses these words doesn't really think about it. (Laughter.) They -- they go up to the drafting section, there is a drafting section, and you'll get a young man or woman there who has to write a very complicated statute, and -- and they might use words they don't really think about. And so I look to a lot of other things, as in Murphy. All right. Now the Copyright Act of '76 has an enormous history, volume after volume, and my guess is you looked through that, or you had somebody look through it. And is there anything that helps you, or that hurts you if you want to say, in -- in that long, long history of the '76 reform? But I'm more -- I -- I mean, all right. The '84 year is in your brief, I think. Okay. All right. I'll look at that. I'll look at that. (Laughter.) Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. All right. Well, I'll look at that. But suppose you're right. Suppose I think -- now I think -- I read that and I say yeah, good point. All right. I made that kind of point in Murphy, and I -- I said let's look at what Congress wanted. And I had a -- I thought fabulous. But, unfortunately, it wasn't fabulous enough because I was writing a dissent. (Laughter.) All right? Now suppose -- and, after all, Murphy involved getting expert fees for the parents of handicapped children when, in fact, they, through the hiring of necessary experts, win. But the majority said in that case: No, they don't get their attorneys' fees. So am I stuck with that? You say no? Well, well, well, this is a general problem, go back to your lengthy career. When do I say, well, I lost; I lost in the consideration of the -- of that, so how long do I keep -- what rule do I follow? What approach do I take? And how long do I keep referring to a dissenting approach or view when others think the contrary? No, no, that's what I'm asking for. Pity. (Laughter.)
