2018,Bucklew v. Precythe,115,Neil Gorsuch,"Mr. Sauer, I believe some time ago you said there were four reasons why you thought at step 2 a defendant should be required to show an alternative. I'm -- I'm not sure we got past the first of those four. I'm not even sure we got the first one out there, actually. And I'm curious what -- what -- what all four are. I'm waiting for four still. But why -- why -- why wouldn't we want to do the comparison, if we're going to do it in gross on a facial challenge, why wouldn't we do the comparison, if you concede it's valid there, why wouldn't we want to do the same comparison specifically when it comes to your client? Perhaps we have to look outside what Missouri has authorized, but -- a firing squad or whatever, but why wouldn't we do that exact same analysis in specific?

2018,Apple v. Pepper,115,Neil Gorsuch,"Well, Mr. Wall, along those lines, I -- I take your point that Illinois Brick and Hanover Shoe might be read about the economic realities of the pass-through mechanism being important, rather than the contractual formalities, whether it's a sales agent or a formal purchase between the manufacturer and the distributor. And antitrust normally accounts for economics, rather than forms of contract. I take your point. But building on what Justice Alito had in mind, Illinois Brick has been questioned by 31 states before this Court in an amicus brief. You're asking us to extend Illinois Brick, admittedly, only because of a contractual formality and the economic realities are the same. I'll spot you all of that for purposes of this question. But why should we build on Illinois Brick? Shouldn't we question Illinois Brick, perhaps, given the fact that so many states have done so. They've repealed it. There haven't been a huge number of reported problems with indirect purchasers and direct purchasers receiving double recovery, one of the problems Illinois Brick built on, and the other one, which Justice Alito alluded to, is direct purchasers don't always sue because there's a threat that monopolists will share the rents with the direct purchasers. And indirect purchasers may be better suited to enforce the antitrust laws. So long wind-up. Sorry, but there -- there's the pitch. Well, but, Mister -- Mr. Frederick, I think you'd agree that there can only be one monopoly rent. And then the question becomes, who's paying it? And it might be spread partially between direct purchasers and indirect purchasers. It might be partially spread between the app makers and the purchasers of apps. And disaggregating that is the question that we've been wrestling with here. I guess here is where I'm stuck and need your help. You say that Illinois Brick is a bright-line rule premised on the existence of a contractual relationship between the buyer -- the ultimate purchaser and the intermediate seller, and that there has to be that kind of relationship, rather than a sales agency relationship like we have here. But antitrust doesn't usually depend upon such contractual formalities. It usually depends upon the underlying economics. And I have a hard time distinguishing this case from Illinois Brick in the sense of -- in the question of economic pass-through and the problems that it presents, the possibility that the intermediate purchaser may absorb the monopoly rent and not pass it along. Now that raises for me the question, further question, and I -- I -- I'll wind it up quickly, I promise, whether Illinois Brick is correct. All right. And you have an amicus that says it's not, but you don't make that argument. I'm really curious why -- -- the plaintiffs' bar is not making that argument before this Court. So there -- there's a whole -- a whole bunch of things for you to chew on. Say I don't -- say I don't buy the formalistic contractual -- it seems to me an argument in -- in -- in the law of contracts rather than the law of antitrust. So help me out with economics. Again -- again, that -- -- that's based on the form of the relationship. Talk to me about the possibility, the problem that the app producer might absorb the monopoly rent. That's the economic problem that I'm stuck with. I understand the 99 cent argument. Let's put that aside. Are we going to create a -- I'm sorry. Go ahead, please. Well, I think Justice Sotomayor's question is a -- requires further exploration. I mean, are -- are we in danger of just incentivizing a restructuring of contracts here so that all that Apple does or people like it is make you purchase directly from the app provider and then it then returns the -- the profit to Apple later? And if that's all we're doing, then what is the point of Illinois Brick? And you still haven't explained to me why the plaintiffs' bar isn't asking to overturn Illinois Brick when 31 states are. So help -- help me on both those. They're two separate questions. Well -- well, assume for the moment that -- that I believe the economics underlying the two arrangements are very similar. Hard to distinguish. I haven't yet heard you give me a good argument why. So let's just posit that. Then it really is just about form, isn't it? Ah, so pricing control is really important to proximate cause then? So pricing control is really important to proximate cause? Sounds kind of late in the day -- -- to come up with a new litigation theory. In the Supreme Court, a blue brief, really? I mean, should we be taking that up now? I mean, maybe you can amend your complaint or something like that on remand, but should we be addressing that? But we're usually -- -- a court of review, not first view, right. ",well mr wall along those line i i take your point that illinois brick and hanover shoe might be read about the economic reality of the pas through mechanism be important rather than the contractual formality whether it be a sale agent or a formal purchase between the manufacturer and the distributor and antitrust normally account for economics rather than form of contract i take your point but building on what justice alito have in mind illinois brick have be question by state before this court in an amicus brief you be ask us to extend illinois brick admittedly only because of a contractual formality and the economic reality be the same I will spot you all of that for purpose of this question but why should we build on illinois brick should not we question illinois brick perhaps give the fact that so many state have do so they have repeal it there have not be a huge number of report problem with indirect purchaser and direct purchaser receive double recovery one of the problem illinois brick build on and the other one which justice alito allude to be direct purchaser do not always sue because there be a threat that monopolists will share the rent with the direct purchaser and indirect purchaser may be well suit to enforce the antitrust law so long wind up sorry but there there be the pitch well but mister mr frederick i think you would agree that there can only be one monopoly rent and then the question become who be pay it and it might be spread partially between direct purchaser and indirect purchaser it might be partially spread between the app maker and the purchaser of apps and disaggregating that be the question that we have be wrestle with here i guess here be where I be stuck and need your help you say that illinois brick be a bright line rule premise on the existence of a contractual relationship between the buyer the ultimate purchaser and the intermediate seller and that there have to be that kind of relationship rather than a sale agency relationship like we have here but antitrust do not usually depend upon such contractual formality it usually depend upon the underlying economics and i have a hard time distinguish this case from illinois brick in the sense of in the question of economic pas through and the problem that it present the possibility that the intermediate purchaser may absorb the monopoly rent and not pass it along now that raise for me the question further question and i i I will wind it up quickly i promise whether illinois brick be correct all right and you have an amicus that say it be not but you do not make that argument I be really curious why the plaintiff bar be not make that argument before this court so there there be a whole a whole bunch of thing for you to chew on say i do not say i do not buy the formalistic contractual it seem to me an argument in in in the law of contract rather than the law of antitrust so help me out with economics again again that that be base on the form of the relationship talk to me about the possibility the problem that the app producer might absorb the monopoly rent that be the economic problem that I be stick with i understand the cent argument let us put that aside be we go to create a I be sorry go ahead please well i think justice sotomayor s question be a require further exploration i mean be be we in danger of just incentivizing a restructuring of contract here so that all that apple do or people like it be make you purchase directly from the app provider and then it then return the the profit to apple later and if that be all we be do then what be the point of illinois brick and you still have not explain to me why the plaintiff bar be not ask to overturn illinois brick when state be so help help me on both those they be two separate question well well assume for the moment that that i believe the economics underlie the two arrangement be very similar hard to distinguish i have not yet hear you give me a good argument why so let us just posit that then it really be just about form be not it ah so price control be really important to proximate because then so price control be really important to proximate because sound kind of late in the day to come up with a new litigation theory in the supreme court a blue brief really i mean should we be take that up now i mean maybe you can amend your complaint or something like that on remand but should we be address that but we be usually a court of review not first view right ,268.00000000000006,Case pending,"Nov 26, 2018","Apple, Inc.","Robert Pepper, et al.",17-204,"Jun 18, 2018",,115,0.0,0.0,0.0,1

2018,"Washington State Department of Licensing v. Cougar Den, Inc.",115,Neil Gorsuch,"Well, counsel, is that so? I mean, I thought the interpretation of the phrase ""in common with"" by the district court in Yakama Indian Nation was that it allowed the state to impose certain regulations that facilitate both native and non-native travel along the same highways. So -- -- safety regulations, speed limits, would facilitate travel in common. Right. But it does regulate the questions that we've been talking about in terms of it does provide some safety regulations, for example, right? That's all, under the Yakama Indian Nation holding, that's all that the treaty would allow you to do. And I guess I'm wondering in the first instance why -- why you're not estopped from arguing a different position today? Well, I -- I don't feel bound. I wonder if you are, though. (Laughter.) Well, we -- counsel, we normally read a -- a -- a phrase to bear the same meaning in all of its applications. And we wouldn't normally read the term ""in common with"" to mean one thing when it's fishing and another thing when it's highways, would we? That would be kind of an extraordinary -- -- reading of a statutory term. What -- what -- what do you think about that, though? But having adopted one reading of it, why wouldn't we be consistent? Okay. The next -- next concern would be then what do we do about the fact that this is also how the district court concluded it after very careful reading in Yakama Indian Nation about the history of the treaty -- -- and looking at the original understanding of both parties and its original meaning at that time, and that the Indians understood it not to mean a common regulation applicable to everybody, but, again, that they would be able to do the same things that they've always done, just with non-native persons present? What kind of -- -- what kind of promise is that? Given the constitutional rights to travel and equal protection, is that a -- is that a -- is that an illusory promise, the promise you've just described? Do you think any of that would hold up today?

2018,The American Legion v. American Humanist Association,115,Neil Gorsuch,"What's the difference between that and an endorsement? You tell us we should abandon Lemon's endorsement test because it's become a dog's breakfast. And nobody knows how to apply it. The circuit courts are confused, you tell us. And then you replace it with coercion but now maybe proselytizing in the reply brief. I'm -- I -- I don't see the daylight between proselytizing and endorsement. Can you help me out? Well, I guess then that's where I -- Well, I don't -- That's where -- that's where I -- I'm just stuck. And -- and to say I endorse something -- -- is -- what's the difference between saying I endorse something and I proselytize or promote, perhaps, is another synonym, something? It seems to me that you are taking us right back to the dog's breakfast you've warned us against. And I do understand the coercion test, but I -- I -- I don't understand your abandonment of it. Why am I not proselytizing religion when I say ""In God we trust"" but I am when I say ""In Jesus Christ we trust""? I'm just proselytizing religion in a more generic sense. Well, there we are. But would you proselytize that test? You endorse the test. Do you proselytize for it? (Laughter.) Well, that -- that raises for me -- that -- that answer raises for me a question about standing. Is it too loud? Is the Star of David too loud? Is it too offensive? There aren't many places in the law where we allow someone to make a federal case out of their offensiveness about a symbol being too loud for them. We accept that people have to sometimes live in a world in which other people's speech offend them. We have to tolerate one another. This is the only area I can think of like that where we allow people to sue over an offense because, for them, it is too loud. And we get into, as a result, having to dictate taste with respect to displays. We have a Ten Commandments display just above you, which may be too loud for many. Why shouldn't we apply our normal standing rules and require more than mere offense to make a federal case out of these? So are you suggesting all Ten Commandment -- I'm sorry. Well, hold on. Just a moment ago, you told us the Ten Commandments can be stripped of their religious significance and that an Indian totem pole may be stripped of its religious significance. Why -- why not so too here? You do -- -- you do suggest we -- at various points we should consider how people process things and whether they're offended and elsewhere you don't. And I guess I am curious in response to Justice Kagan, you say we shouldn't apply Lemon in this case. It's been a long time since this Court has applied Lemon, but yet the courts of appeals continue to cite it and use it. And -- and, there, reasonable observers process things in all sorts of different ways. And it has resulted in a welter of confusion, I think, by anyone's admission, including your own. Is it time for this Court to thank Lemon for its services and send it on its way? (Laughter.) But, if you don't find it useful in this case and you don't want the Court to apply it in this case, what about all those poor court of appeals judges who are left still with confusion? We haven't overruled it, but we never use it anymore, except for when we might have 25 years ago. And I -- I -- I think a majority of this Court, though never at the same time, has advocated for Lemon's dismissal. So what do -- I mean, is it really fair on the lower court judges struggling to apply this Court's dictates if we don't provide an answer on Lemon? Wait a minute -- -- let -- let's just take that. I mean, we're fighting the hypothetical, counsel. Now I love doing that too. But let's just stick with the hypothetical. You can't transfer it. You can't move it. You have to tear it down. Road-side crosses along public highways, for example, those are many. And in some places, they've been ruled to be unconstitutional, including in my old court. Because they endorse religion, proselytize. So back to -- -- Justice Alito's question. If you could answer it, I -- I'd be grateful. That would help me. What if -- -- what if -- what if -- what if other cities replicated the 9/11 cross? It's a different world. It's a different time. History's changed. But here's an example of a cross that has very contemporary meaning and to a lot of people. Would -- would you prohibit cities and states from duplicating that cross on -- on their -- on their public memorials to 9/11? No, no, it's -- it's -- my question is, it's a 9/11 memorial. And that's the predominant thing, and there might be some names on it, just like our Bladensburg cross. Well -- -- you're -- you're -- you're in the same boat, though, saying apply Lemon -- keep Lemon, keep it -- keep it around for a rainy day, but please, please, please, do not apply Lemon to this case.

2018,Timbs v. Indiana,115,Neil Gorsuch,"General, before we get to the in rem argument and its application to this case, can we just get one thing off the table? We all agree that the Excessive Fines Clause is incorporated against the states. Whether this particular fine qualifies because it's an in rem forfeiture, another question. But can we at least get the -- the theoretical question off the table, whether you want to do it through the Due Process Clause and look at history and tradition, you know, gosh, excessive fines, guarantees against them go back to Magna Carta and 1225, the English Bill of Rights, the Virginia Declaration of Rights, pretty deep history, or whether one wants to look at privileges and immunities, you might come to the same conclusion. Can we at least -- can we at least agree on that? Well, I -- I think -- I think a ""yes"" or ""no"" would probably be a good starting place. (Laughter.) Well, whatever the Excessive Fine Clause guarantees, we can argue, again, about its scope and in rem and in personam, but whatever it, in fact, is, it applies against the states, right? I mean, most -- most of these incorporation cases took place in like the 1940s. And here we are in 2018 -- -- still litigating incorporation of the Bill of Rights. Really? Come on, General. Wait a minute, counsel, you know, if -- if -- just -- just to pause on that for a second, you know, the Indiana Supreme Court didn't address the merits questions, didn't address any of this forfeiture, in rem, in personam. It just said that the Excessive Fines Clause is not incorporated, period. Why isn't that just wrong? And then you can go make these arguments about why it doesn't apply to this case on remand. Do you really want us to answer the merits questions too? Okay. Let's say this Court's not inclined to revisit Austin. You're going to lose not just the incorporation question but the merits question too. Could these work? Well, the -- the part that's different about modern forfeitures -- and I think this is what Justice Sotomayor's getting at -- is that many of them are punitive to the person and that that was not part of in rem forfeitures at common law. We're dealing with a world in which it's different in kind, not just degree, not just a number but in kind. And that's what Justice Scalia, that's what everybody, in Austin agreed on. That much was unanimous. And I guess I'm asking you, given the concession by the State before the Indiana Supreme Court that the forfeiture here was punitive, if we do -- don't overrule Austin, and you want us to apply not just the question of incorporation but go to the merits, don't you lose? Sure. But you conceded that it's punitive. Now it becomes a question of proportionality. The statute here says it's punitive and you've conceded the statute's punitive. So I'm still stuck on how -- how do you get out of that box? ",general before we get to the in rem argument and its application to this case can we just get one thing off the table we all agree that the excessive fine clause be incorporate against the state whether this particular fine qualifies because it be an in rem forfeiture another question but can we at least get the the theoretical question off the table whether you want to do it through the due process clause and look at history and tradition you know gosh excessive fine guarantee against them go back to magna carta and the english bill of right the virginia declaration of right pretty deep history or whether one want to look at privilege and immunity you might come to the same conclusion can we at least can we at least agree on that well i i think i think a yes or no would probably be a good starting place laughter well whatever the excessive fine clause guarantee we can argue again about its scope and in rem and in personam but whatever it in fact be it apply against the state right i mean most most of these incorporation case take place in like the s and here we be in still litigate incorporation of the bill of right really come on general wait a minute counsel you know if if just just to pause on that for a second you know the indiana supreme court do not address the merit question do not address any of this forfeiture in rem in personam it just say that the excessive fine clause be not incorporate period why be not that just wrong and then you can go make these argument about why it do not apply to this case on remand do you really want us to answer the merit question too okay let us say this court s not incline to revisit austin you be go to lose not just the incorporation question but the merit question too could these work well the the part that be different about modern forfeiture and i think this be what justice sotomayor s get at be that many of them be punitive to the person and that that be not part of in rem forfeiture at common law we be deal with a world in which it be different in kind not just degree not just a number but in kind and that be what justice scalia that be what everybody in austin agree on that much be unanimous and i guess I be ask you give the concession by the state before the indiana supreme court that the forfeiture here be punitive if we do do not overrule austin and you want us to apply not just the question of incorporation but go to the merit do not you lose sure but you concede that it be punitive now it become a question of proportionality the statute here say it be punitive and you have concede the statute s punitive so I be still stick on how how do you get out of that box ,160.11999999999995,Roberts Court,"Nov 28, 2018",Tyson Timbs,Indiana,17-1091,"Jun 18, 2018","Feb 20, 2019",115,1.0,1.0,1.0,1
