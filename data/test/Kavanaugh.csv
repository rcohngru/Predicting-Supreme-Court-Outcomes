But the effect -- the effect was that, in taking your goods to market, which was the promise, in exchange for a huge area of land, an area of land the size of the State of Maryland that was given up by the tribe, that you could take your goods to market. And this burdens, as Justice Kagan said, this burdens substantially their ability to take goods to market. That -- that reading of ""in common with"" was rejected by the Court in the fishing cases. It doesn't say that. The -- the purpose wasn't -- the purpose wasn't just to leave the reservation, though. The purpose, as I understand it, was to leave for the -- for trade. And if you so burden the trade, that seems inconsistent with the purpose. If an off-reservation sales tax is okay, as you say it is, why is an off-reservation possession tax not okay? Suppose it is a possession tax. Is that then okay? An off-reservation possession tax? That seems to be an argument that it's a sham, that it's really getting to transportation. ""Sham"" might be too strong a word, but it's not -- it's really about transportation, not possession. What if it's really about possession? Counsel, do you -- The language of the treaty does not distinguish, though -- -- between the ceded area and the other areas.

In that situation, does the State have to treat the federal employees the same as the most favored group, if group 1 has a favorable tax treatment, or does the State in that example have discretion since the federal employees are similarly situated to both group 1, who gets the favorable, and group 2, who does not?

2018,Manhattan Community Access Corp. v. Halleck,116,Brett M. Kavanaugh,"Does your -- does your argument depend on having editorial discretion? In other words, if you have no editorial discretion at all, do you still win under Jackson? Is that your theory? You referred to public function. But, under our cases, it has to be a traditional public function, something that's traditionally exclusively been a public function. How do you suggest that this qualifies under those precedents? I don't understand why leasing or operating a public access channel is -- is akin to one of these traditional public functions that are described in the cases. Help me with that. Why isn't this -- Sorry to interrupt. Why isn't this more like a utility in Jackson where, let's say, all editorial discretion's been taken away, and then you're operating, in essence, like a utility, and the Court there was very careful to say that wasn't -- even though heavily regulated, that wasn't good enough? You -- You've referred a few times to the school access cases. Of course, those were government property, right? So, here, just to make sure I'm following, MNN is a private company, correct? And operating a channel on a cable system that's also private, privately owned? And it's heavily regulated by the state, right? So it's not government property. It's not operating on government property. It's just heavily regulated in terms of being forced how it -- how it performs its functions, which, again, coming back to the utility and everything we said in Jackson on that front, but I -- I just don't think the school access cases help you because they assume the conclusion. It's government property there. No one disputes it. My point is simply it's a private company operating a channel on another private company's system, and it's forced in terms of how it exercises its discretion to do so in a particular way by the government. But that just means it's heavily regulated in terms of its editorial discretion. You're melding, I think, the public forum question with the state action question. But doesn't that have -- So, if the government imposes a first-come, first-served requirement on a private company -- -- what happens then? Because that's some of the hypotheticals, as you know, raised in the amici briefs about Twitter and YouTube and the like. So what's -- But I thought you said to the Chief Justice that the reservation of first-come, first-served is what gave you the property interest. Well, that's -- that's -- but what gave you the property interest if it's something other than the first-come, first-served? It seems certain -- So, if a utility gets rights-of-way from the local government, does that give the local government the -- does that make the utility a state actor? The language -- I'm repeating myself -- but the language that we've used in the cases is traditionally exclusively a public function. And I'm not sure -- it's not even true in this case, right, in other states, other localities, these public access channels are not run by -- But you -- you agree -- if you prevail here, you agree that it would be different if it were a private company -- we all agree it's a private company -- that operates in open forum, Justice Breyer's General Motors example. The government can't require first-come, first-served on that, and -- ",do your do your argument depend on have editorial discretion in other word if you have no editorial discretion at all do you still win under jackson be that your theory you refer to public function but under our case it have to be a traditional public function something that be traditionally exclusively be a public function how do you suggest that this qualifies under those precedent i do not understand why leasing or operate a public access channel be be akin to one of these traditional public function that be describe in the case help me with that why be not this sorry to interrupt why be not this more like a utility in jackson where let us say all editorial discretion s be take away and then you be operate in essence like a utility and the court there be very careful to say that be not even though heavily regulate that be not good enough you you have refer a few time to the school access case of course those we be government property right so here just to make sure I be follow mnn be a private company correct and operate a channel on a cable system that be also private privately own and it be heavily regulate by the state right so it be not government property it be not operate on government property it be just heavily regulate in term of be force how it how it perform its function which again come back to the utility and everything we say in jackson on that front but i i just do not think the school access case help you because they assume the conclusion it be government property there no one dispute it my point be simply it be a private company operate a channel on another private company s system and it be force in term of how it exercise its discretion to do so in a particular way by the government but that just mean it be heavily regulate in term of its editorial discretion you be meld i think the public forum question with the state action question but do not that have so if the government impose a first come first serve requirement on a private company what happen then because that be some of the hypothetical as you know raise in the amici brief about twitter and youtube and the like so what be but i thought you say to the chief justice that the reservation of first come first serve be what give you the property interest well that be that be but what give you the property interest if it be something other than the first come first serve it seem certain so if a utility get right of way from the local government do that give the local government the do that make the utility a state actor the language I be repeat myself but the language that we have use in the case be traditionally exclusively a public function and I be not sure it be not even true in this case right in other state other locality these public access channel be not run by but you you agree if you prevail here you agree that it would be different if it we be a private company we all agree it be a private company that operate in open forum justice breyer s general motor example the government can not require first come first serve on that and ,195.95,Case pending,"Feb 25, 2019","Manhattan Community Access Corporation, et al.","Deedee Halleck, et al.",17-1702,"Oct 12, 2018",,116.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

What do you say to them? Well, suppose -- -- suppose after this case Hyattsville puts up a cross and College Park puts up a cross and the surrounding communities put up crosses, and they -- there's mixed purposes. Some people do it because they want to support it because they want to celebrate Christianity. Some people do it because they say we want to celebrate war dead. There's mixed purposes. Proselytizing or not proselytizing? Presumptively valid and can -- that presumption can be overcome when? What -- what -- What -- -- what's your answer -- what's your answer to the cross on City Hall? I didn't get whether your answer is that's unconstitutional or constitutional. And in that dissent, he said that a cross on City Hall would be unconstitutional. Do you -- Do you agree? Even though all five -- But -- but all five crosses -- Excuse me. All five crosses in Justice Kagan's hypothetical, I believe, are the same. Of course, the purpose articulated, unstated or stated, but not visible, might be different. But the crosses are all the same. And you're saying it depends on the implicit purpose or reason it was put up? So, if that's put up as a war memorial but it doesn't have words around it, that has to come down? I -- I take your point that it's a religious symbol. I'm not going to dispute that at all. But our cases have upheld religious displays and religious words in cases like Marsh, the chaplain in Congress, and the prayer cases like Van Orden, the Ten Commandments, cases like Town of Greece, legislative prayer before a meeting. How do you square your position in this case with those cases, which have upheld religious symbols, displays, or words in government property or government events? What about the Ten -- the -- I'm sorry to interrupt -- -- but the Ten Commandments then? But how -- -- how can it be useful when we haven't used it in the most important cases that are on point here, cases like Town of Greece, it's not used. Van Orden, Marsh v. Chambers, those are the cases that are on point. Those go back 40 years, and we haven't used the test. And to Justice Gorsuch's point, the lower courts need some clarity about that. If the test isn't being used, that would suggest that the test doesn't work for this context. Well, Town of Greece was certainly a case, and that's about prayer before a legislative meeting. I think you -- -- I think you alluded to this earlier, but I wanted to ask it so I'm clear. The distinction between the Ten Commandments and the cross? Can I -- Your -- your argument sounds in liberty. You raise an important liberty argument. In thinking about a liberty claim, I think the Constitution tilts toward liberty in its structure, and one of the ways it does so is there are lots of avenues for you to -- the Bladensburg counsel could change its approach here. The Maryland legislature could say no more. The Maryland constitution, as Judge Sutton would remind us, could, or the Maryland courts could prohibit it. With that in mind, the Establishment Clause test referenced a historical practice can be thought of as setting a floor, an important one, but there are other ways the Constitution tilts toward liberty and other avenues. How should we think about that, or should we think about that at all, or is that irrelevant to us? I guess my question was, in thinking about our role, what is the role of this Court in a case like this? Should it matter that we know that the Bladensburg council, the state legislature of Maryland, the Maryland constitution, are all there, or is that irrelevant to how we think about this? The fact that there are other ways in which the cross -- other bodies that can decide the cross is too much, the Maryland -- the local council could, the Maryland legislature. And I'm not saying that's the right answer. I'm just saying, is that relevant to how we think about our role in a case like this or not? No, that the cross should come down. In other words, the Bladensburg council could transfer the property -- -- to the Maryland legislature. The Maryland state courts, the Maryland court of appeals could decide. Yeah.
