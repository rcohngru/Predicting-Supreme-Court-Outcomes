Is there contrary -- is there contrary evidence? What is your basis for arguing that there would be a shorter twilight period with lethal gas? Are you relying on Dr. Antognini's testimony for that? You're not? Okay. So what are you relying on? But you're making this very complicated. Isn't the question for what period of time will Petitioner be -- not be insensate but may have difficulty breathing? All right. And how do you get to that figure with -- the figure that applies there with respect to lethal gas? Yeah. Okay. What are the numbers? And where does that come from -- -- is what I'm asking. So you're relying on -- on the Oklahoma study for that? Okay. But what -- didn't -- Dr. Antognini said that it would be the same for lethal gas and for -- All right. So your -- you reject his testimony. He says it's the same. So you want to accept him -- you want to accept his number -- I mean, maybe there's more. That's why I'm asking this. Do you want to accept his number for lethal gas but reject his number for pentobarbital -- for -- for the current protocol? Even though what he said was that they are the same. Doesn't the -- isn't the role of the second prong at least in part, and maybe in full, what has been called by the lower courts as the second prong, something that informs the first prong?

2018,Apple v. Pepper,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Mr. Wall, could I ask you about what troubles me about your position, and -- and it is this: Illinois Brick was not about economic theory. It was about the court's -- the court's -- the basis for the decision was not economic theory, as I read the case. It's the court's calculation of what makes for an effective and efficient litigation scheme. And maybe your answer to this question is that the validity of Illinois Brick is not before us. But I really wonder whether, in light of what has happened since then, the court's evaluation stands up. Take the third point that it makes about that the direct -- the so-called direct purchasers are the most efficient and most -- in the best position to -- to sue. If we look at this case, how many app developers are there whose apps are sold at the Apple store? Yeah. Has any one of them ever sued? That's an interesting theory, but is that the theory -- is that your claim? I thought this case was all about the 30 percent. So the 30 percent has nothing to do with this? What concerns me about your argument is that it doesn't seem to be based on the way in which this claim was understood by the lower courts. Maybe they misunderstood it. But, I mean, the opening line of the -- the order granting Apple's motion to dismiss the second amended complaint by the district court: ""The thrust of Plaintiff's second amended complaint is that Apple has engaged in antitrust conduct by collecting 30 percent of the price of iPhone applications."" And where -- okay. Where -- can you point to me where in the Ninth Circuit's opinion they understood your claim in the way that you've characterized it this morning?

So how can -- how can the debtor not continue to perform duties under the contract? What would that -- I'm sorry. What would happen in this situation?

Well, then that's very artificial and you get into this metaphysical question of what they're doing.

2018,Dawson v. Steager,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","I -- I don't follow -- -- why that is so. If the -- if you have two categories of state employees and they're very similar and they're treated differently, and then you have a category of federal employees who are similar to both of those categories of state employees, wouldn't you have to determine which group of state employees are most -- are more similar to the federal employees? Otherwise, it -- I don't see how it's discrimination. Could you just say what you mean by ""facially discriminatory""? Let me try this out. Let me try this out and see if this is close to what you're saying. Where you have a variety of categories of state employees and some get the benefit in question and some don't get the benefit in question, so the first step would be you compare all the categories of -- the relevant categories of state employees and you identify the characteristics that distinguish the employees in the favored class from the -- from the characteristics of those in the disfavored class. And once you've done that, then you ask whether the federal employees have those characteristics. That would be step two. But the -- the -- I think even when you do that, you will very -- unless this -- unless the states get to do just about what any -- whatever they want, you will have situations where the federal employees are pretty similar to the ones in the favored class, but they're not identical. And then you've got a judgment call. And I don't quite know how to resolve that. Now is this -- is this right? Is that -- or am I off base with this? Well, if that were true, then this would apply only when the discrimination -- the alleged discrimination affects a lot of employees, because other than -- in fact, how many employees would have to be affected before it would have any kind of tangible effect on the finances of the federal government? What are the characteristics -- No. That -- that can't be -- Could you just explain, what are the unique characteristics of those who get the favorable treatment, the characteristics that distinguish them from the state employees who don't get it? What are the characteristics that they -- they have? And then we can see whether a marshal or a deputy marshal has those characteristics. All right. Well -- Deputy marshals have a risk too. Why does that matter? Well, what would be the argument for giving favorable treatment -- suppose we're just talking about categories of state employees, and you have -- you have law enforcement -- you have law enforcement officers who are basically identical, but one is in a law-enforcement-only plan and the other is in a plan that includes other employees. What would be the reason for treating those -- those differently? Okay. Well, so now you're saying it's funding considerations, but it's not just the fact that they're -- they're only law enforcement officers. Suppose a retiree -- Suppose a retiree had worked for 20 years as a deputy sheriff, one year as a sheriff, and then retired. What -- what would that -- how would that employee be treated? Okay. So then why wouldn't the -- why wouldn't the answer be that -- that Mr. Dawson is treated the same way? For part of -- if there's a -- if his duty -- if he is similar to deputy sheriffs but not to -- but also, you know, during the time when he was a deputy marshal, why wouldn't the answer be to treat him the same way, to break it down that way? Well, I don't know where you're going with that -- -- because suppose the state -- the state has a -- all of its employees are in one plan, okay, and the state says those people get this benefit. And now you have a federal employee who comes along, and the state says, well, you don't get that benefit because you weren't in the state plan. I mean, you -- you think that's okay? Okay. So then I don't know what you're -- where you're going with the fact that it turns on whether you're in one plan or another plan. Yeah, the components of the plan, but not the mere fact that you are or are not a -- a member of that plan. ",i i do not follow why that be so if the if you have two category of state employee and they be very similar and they be treat differently and then you have a category of federal employee who be similar to both of those category of state employee would not you have to determine which group of state employee be most be more similar to the federal employee otherwise it i do not see how it be discrimination could you just say what you mean by facially discriminatory let me try this out let me try this out and see if this be close to what you be say where you have a variety of category of state employee and some get the benefit in question and some do not get the benefit in question so the first step would be you compare all the category of the relevant category of state employee and you identify the characteristic that distinguish the employee in the favored class from the from the characteristic of those in the disfavored class and once you have do that then you ask whether the federal employee have those characteristic that would be step two but the the i think even when you do that you will very unless this unless the state get to do just about what any whatever they want you will have situation where the federal employee be pretty similar to the one in the favored class but they be not identical and then you have get a judgment call and i do not quite know how to resolve that now be this be this right be that or be i off base with this well if that we be true then this would apply only when the discrimination the allege discrimination affect a lot of employee because other than in fact how many employee would have to be affect before it would have any kind of tangible effect on the finance of the federal government what be the characteristic no that that can not be could you just explain what be the unique characteristic of those who get the favorable treatment the characteristic that distinguish them from the state employee who do not get it what be the characteristic that they they have and then we can see whether a marshal or a deputy marshal have those characteristic all right well deputy marshal have a risk too why do that matter well what would be the argument for give favorable treatment suppose we be just talk about category of state employee and you have you have law enforcement you have law enforcement officer who be basically identical but one be in a law enforcement only plan and the other be in a plan that include other employee what would be the reason for treat those those differently okay well so now you be say it be fund consideration but it be not just the fact that they be they be only law enforcement officer suppose a retiree suppose a retiree have work for year as a deputy sheriff one year as a sheriff and then retire what what would that how would that employee be treat okay so then why would not the why would not the answer be that that mr dawson be treat the same way for part of if there be a if his duty if he be similar to deputy sheriff but not to but also you know during the time when he be a deputy marshal why would not the answer be to treat him the same way to break it down that way well i do not know where you be go with that because suppose the state the state have a all of its employee be in one plan okay and the state say those people get this benefit and now you have a federal employee who come along and the state say well you do not get that benefit because you be not in the state plan i mean you you think that be okay okay so then i do not know what you be where you be go with the fact that it turn on whether you be in one plan or another plan yeah the component of the plan but not the mere fact that you be or be not a a member of that plan ,243.40000000000003,Roberts Court,"Dec 3, 2018","James Dawson, et ux.","Dale W.

And if we step back and ask who owns, in the colloquial sense at least of the word, these channels, is it the cable company or is it the government, what would your answer be? How can that be? The -- I mean, the cable company didn't decide that it wanted to dedicate these channels to this purpose, and it doesn't control what's on these channels. It's the government that said you have to provide these channels and make them available on certain grounds. Well, suppose the city appointed MNN to decide who would have access to a facility in Central Park. Would you say MNN is not -- MNN is not then a state actor in exercising that authority? Well, let's say there's a place where people can go and speak in Central Park or there is a -- a facility where concerts are put on.

It seems strange to me to say that if the policy is first-come, first-served, no editorial discretion, therefore, no viewpoint discrimination, the First Amendment applies, but if there's discretion and the administrator has the authority to engage in viewpoint discrimination, the First Amendment doesn't apply. It seems exactly backwards. If -- if the government is running something and it allows people to speak, it seems to me there -- there are two possibilities. One, it's throwing this open for anybody to speak, but if it's not doing that, then what happens there is government speech. Now would you -- is this government speech? If -- all right. In the situation where there's discretion, would you say that it's government speech? So you're not -- you just -- they -- they empower the administrator to decide who's going to talk, and the administrator chooses the viewpoints that it likes. That is -- that's government speech?

2018,The American Legion v. American Humanist Association,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","And does it -- does it matter -- -- does it matter in this particular case that this cross was put up to commemorate the deaths of 49 real people and that this was done in the wake of World War I? Could I -- could I ask a question that picks up on a question that Justice Ginsburg asked earlier? So let's say there is a shooting at a church, and Christians are targeted and killed. There is a shooting at a synagogue and Jews are targeted and killed. There is a shooting at a mosque and Muslims are targeted and killed. In each case, the town says we are outraged by this, we want to put up a monument to express our sympathy and solidarity with the families and with the communities that they represent. They ask those people what kind of monument would you like, and they all say it's very important for us to put up something of religious significance. And that -- the town does that. Those towns do that. Would that be a violation of the Establishment Clause? I mean, this would be a different case if some of those 49 soldiers whose names are associated with this monument were Jewish or -- or Muslim or a member of some other non-Christian faith and the town insisted on putting their names on a monument in the form of a cross. But there's no evidence that that's what happened here. Is that right? All right. Well, it's speculation, but we don't know that there was anybody who objected, that there was any family who objected to having this form of a memorial -- -- for their fallen family member, do we? I mean, there are cross monuments all over the country, many of them quite old. Do you want them all taken down? So which ones do you think can stand? Yeah, and that's the way this sort of thing is being handled today in a pluralistic society in which ordinary people get along pretty well and -- and are not at each other's throats about religious divisions. But let me ask you about some others that are not in Arlington. How about the Irish Brigade monument at Gettysburg put up in 1888? There were 12 -- -- there were 12 -- are there 12 African-American soldiers among the 49? And do you think that the -- that the -- the -- the situation of -- of African Americans in Prince George's County at that time was worse -- was better than the situation for Jews? Well, along those lines, would it be a violation of the Establishment Clause for the state to promote secularism or humanism as opposed to religion? Well, let me take you back to Justice Breyer's question, which is an interesting question to me, and your response was he's wrong on the numbers. But I don't know. I've got pictures of lots of crosses that are on public land. So, you know, assuming for the sake of argument that there are 50 or there are -- there are a lot of them, and we say you got to take down all of the crosses, what message does that send when people see that on -- on TV, they see crosses all over the country being knocked down? All right, take -- move -- moved, taken down, but they're -- they're taken down one way or the other. What -- what message is that? That -- that my promote a particular world view, but is that -- is that consistent with the Establishment Clause? You raised -- so you just said no other cross has to be torn down, just this one. Would you like us to write that in the opinion? (Laughter.) Say we're going to write an opinion and we're going to say this cross is particularly bad. This one has to be moved, torn down, transferred, so forth. But every other cross is fine. Is that what you just said? Okay. I misunderstood.

Isn't that person imprisoned during that -- that first year? Well, suppose the statute said that, upon conviction of this offense, the defendant shall be sentenced to five years imprisonment. No discretion for the judge. But the person has been in detention for a year. Does that mean that the judge cannot credit that person for the one year spent in -- in official detention because that person wasn't imprisoned at that time? Now that's true, and that's -- it raises a very interesting question. Why is that the point at which we look at this? Congress enacts a statute, all right? The statute is going to apply in the future. It wants to describe something that it anticipates will occur in the future. Isn't it natural for it to use the present tense? So let's say some -- an employer adopts a rule that says, going forward, if employees work on the weekend, they will get -- an employee who works, present tense, on the weekend gets overtime. What do we read into that -- that -- it's how you describe something that is going to occur on a recurring basis in the future. So it's natural to use present tense. Why does it -- why do we infer from that that you're going to examine this person's status in jail in real time and ask, okay, today, what is he -- what is he doing? Is -- tomorrow, what is he doing? Do you see what I'm saying? But what do you think -- -- is the -- the purpose of supervised release? A person can be -- who is in prison serving a sentence can receive vocational training or any other sort of training, but I thought that the purpose of -- of supervised release or parole was to see how that person would do in the outside world. I don't want to take up your rebuttal time, but -- Suppose the -- the defendant, while in the -- while in pretrial detention, does something that would constitute a violation of the conditions of supervised release. Can that be the grounds for a revocation? I'm sorry. Just -- so, in this case, the way you interpret what happened, if Mr. Mont had done that during the term of pretrial detention, that would not be a ground for revocation of -- of supervised -- And would the district court during that time have jurisdiction to consider -- to adjudicate an alleged violation that occurred before incarceration? Where it would not be deprived of jurisdiction during that period? What if somebody is being held -- I mean, what if somebody is being held in a jail where the sheriff says: This is my jail, and I supervise the people here, and I don't want any federal probation officers messing around in my jail? Does it -- is that different?

2018,Timbs v. Indiana,112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","There are a few others that have not been incorporated, isn't that right? Well, what is the provision in the Constitution that you rely on? It's a component of -- of the liberty that's substantively -- substantively protected by the Fourth Amendment's Due Process Clause? Well, your client was convicted of an offense that was punishable by a maximum of 10 years' imprisonment; am I correct? Twenty years' imprisonment. And he was sentenced to six, but it was -- it ws suspended, right? So, if he had been sentenced to six years of actual imprisonment, would that have been a violation of the Eighth Amendment? Well, what have we said about the application of the grossly disproportionate standard? Well, I mean in the context of -- of imprisonment, not fines. If we were to assume for the sake of argument that imprisonment for six years would not be an Eighth Amendment violation for this offense, what would that say about a fine of $42,000? Is it possible that six years' imprisonment is not an Eighth Amendment violation, but a fine of $42,000 is an Eighth Amendment violation? But we're talking about a federal constitutional standard, not -- -- whatever sentencing philosophy any one of the thousands of judges in the United States who impose sentences might think is the right sentence for a particular crime and a particular offender. So you're saying even if it's a classic in rem forfeiture of a kind that's been known for centuries, that would potentially violate the Excessive Fines Clause? This gets me back to the question I was asking before. If six years' imprisonment is not a violation of the Eighth Amendment, and, you know, you said it might be, I think you might have something of an uphill fight to prove that, but three years, two years? How -- how low would the ceiling of permissible term of imprisonment have to go in order to justify a holding that a fine of $42,000 is a violation of the Eighth Amendment? What is the equation between the -- the monetary -- between dollars in -- in a fine and time imprisonment? Well, let me give you two examples. What -- suppose your client, instead of using a -- a Land Rover, was it? Yes, a Land Rover, had been using a 15-year-old Kia or, at the other extreme, suppose that he used a Bugatti, which costs like a quarter of a million dollars. Would the Excessive Fine Clause apply differently in those three cases? Well, would the result be different? If he had been driving a -- a car with a -- a book value of $1500, would the result be different? We know. It is -- it's the offense we have here. We know what the offense is. What is the difference between the approach that you're advocating here and the way the Court used to address the question whether rights protected by the Bill of Rights apply to the states, before it began the process of incorporating provisions of the Bill of Rights one by one, and it said that what applied to the states were those rights that were implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. So there was a two-tiered system. And that seems to be what you're asking us to go back to with respect to the Excessive Fines Clause. Is there a difference? I -- I don't -- could you explain what is the difference between those two approaches? But, if Austin were overruled, then the rule as applicable to the federal government would change as well? So I'm still not seeing the difference between them. Well, isn't that pretty much what the dissent in McDonald said? We don't like Heller, but at least let's just keep it applicable to the District of Columbia and the federal government and not apply it to the states. Well, at the time of McDonald and at the present time, all the -- the Court has held that the Second Amendment right protects the right to have certain firearms in the home for self-defense. It hasn't gone further. But, if this Court were to go further, let's say in a case -- in another case involving the District of Columbia, and said that the right included something more than that, would we have to go through another round of incorporation inquiry to determine whether this broader right applies to the state, or would it follow automatically under McDonald that it -- it applies to the states?

2018,"Rimini Street, Inc. v. Oracle USA, Inc.",112,"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, it says -- the second sentence says that the -- the court may award reasonable attorneys' fees as part of the costs. So what does that do to your argument that ""costs"" has a very narrow meaning that can't include attorneys' fees?

It -- costs were whatever the states regarded as costs, right? Whatever it -- was in the -- and so, if I looked at every single one of the state fee schedules in 1831, what would I find?
