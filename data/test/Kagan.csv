2018,Bucklew v. Precythe,114,Elena Kagan,"So are you saying, Mr. Sauer, that we would be in a different situation in this case right now if the Petitioner had instead requested an electrocution or a firing squad? May I ask a -- a different question? You know, one of the things that strike me -- strikes me, when I went back and -- and looked at Baze, there's a lot about kind of deference to a state legislature and state officials about determining the appropriate method of execution, about giving a kind of considered judgment to the sort of pain that would be expected from an execution, as well as their interests in carrying out legitimate sentences and making decisions on that basis. But what strikes me is that when we think about that, those officials really are thinking in gross, if you know what I mean. They're thinking about a method of execution as applied to the general class of people and deciding that it's appropriate. And what, of course, makes this case very different is that it's not in gross. It's a particular person that says I have a highly unusual condition that will make the execution highly unusual, that will have me suffer highly unusual pain. And in that context, I think all of that stuff that we talked about in Baze about why we should refer to state-considered judgments really falls away because there's been no considered judgment, surely by the legislature and, in general, by officials, about -- about one particular person. And it strikes me that because that's true, the way we look at a case like this has to change. So I'm -- I'm wondering, you know, what your response to that is. See, I'm not sure that that's true, because those officials are working within a system. They're working within a set of legislative rules that have been made in this sort of general sense. And for them to go outside that system would be -- you know, and say it's not appropriate for this particular person would be an extraordinary person for -- an extraordinary thing for an individual person to do. So I don't think we could realistically give the same kind of deference to that sort of decision. ",so be you say mr sauer that we would be in a different situation in this case right now if the petitioner have instead request an electrocution or a firing squad may i ask a a different question you know one of the thing that strike me strike me when i go back and and look at baze there be a lot about kind of deference to a state legislature and state official about determine the appropriate method of execution about give a kind of consider judgment to the sort of pain that would be expect from an execution as well as their interest in carry out legitimate sentence and make decision on that basis but what strike me be that when we think about that those official really be think in gross if you know what i mean they be think about a method of execution as apply to the general class of people and decide that it be appropriate and what of course make this case very different be that it be not in gross it be a particular person that say i have a highly unusual condition that will make the execution highly unusual that will have me suffer highly unusual pain and in that context i think all of that stuff that we talk about in baze about why we should refer to state consider judgment really fall away because there be be no consider judgment surely by the legislature and in general by official about about one particular person and it strike me that because that be true the way we look at a case like this have to change so I be I be wonder you know what your response to that be see I be not sure that that be true because those official be work within a system they be work within a set of legislative rule that have be make in this sort of general sense and for them to go outside that system would be you know and say it be not appropriate for this particular person would be an extraordinary person for an extraordinary thing for an individual person to do so i do not think we could realistically give the same kind of deference to that sort of decision ,141.76000000000005,Case pending,"Nov 6, 2018",Russell Bucklew,"Anne Precythe, et al.",17-8151,"Apr 30, 2018",,114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2018,Apple v. Pepper,114,Elena Kagan,"Does your answer to Justice Breyer depend on what you said, that the alleged monopolization is in the distribution function? Because I understood the -- the Respondents now to be saying, no, that's wrong; the alleged monopolization is in the apps themselves. In other words, the consumer says you have a monopoly on apps. You might also have a monopoly on the distribution function, which the app developers have to live with, but you have a monopoly on apps, which the consumers have to live with. So, in responding to Justice Breyer, you said: Well, it's because the alleged monopoly is the distribution function. But I don't think that that's correct. Well, Mr. Wall, I think you're avoiding the question a bit because, I mean, the questions that are being put to you by my colleagues are really, what was Illinois Brick about? Was it about a vertical supply chain or, instead, was it about a pass-through theory? Now, in the facts of Illinois Brick and, indeed, in the facts of all the Illinois Brick cases that we've discussed, you had both. So you didn't have to separate the two. And now, here, you don't have both, because this is not a vertical supply chain, but there still is a pass-through mechanism. So then the question is, does Illinois Brick apply to that or not? And I think what Justice Breyer was suggesting to you, that as long as it's not that vertical supply chain where the person is not buying from the monopolist itself, here, the person is transacting with the monopolist itself, that that's what separates this case from Illinois Brick and makes it entirely different, notwithstanding that there's some kind of pass-through mechanism involved. General, I have to say I find that a not intuitive argument, I mean, because it just seems to me that when you're looking at the relationship between the consumer and Apple, that there is only one step. I mean, I pick up my iPhone. I go to Apple's App Store. I pay Apple directly with the credit card information that I've supplied to Apple. From -- from my perspective, I've just engaged in a one-step transaction with Apple. And when I come in and say Apple is a monopolist and Apple is charging a super-competitive price by -- by extracting a commission that it can only extract because of its market power, I mean, there's my one step. Does it make a difference, General, that -- that Apple is influencing the prices here? In other words, this is -- you're suggesting that the app developers are just sort of setting these prices independently -- -- but I'll give you sort of two ways in which that's not true. The first way is this 99 cent charge -- -- which you might say, well, that doesn't matter because, you know, it could be 99 cents or it could be $100.99. But, in fact, these are all low-cost products for the most part. So saying a price has to end with the -- you know, the -- the number 99 is saying a lot about the fact that you can't charge 77 cents or 55 cents -- -- or 32 cents. So that's one. And the other is the entire allegation here is that Apple is truly a monopolist on both sides of the market. It's able to dictate to developers whatever price structure it wants, and it's also able to dictate to consumers what the nature of the sale is going to be. And in that event, it -- it sure seems as though, you know, Apple -- you know, it happened to set up this commission that puts it in the ambit of Illinois Brick, but it could have done a thousand other things that are essentially the same that would have taken it out of the Illinois Brick rule. But if you have to bid in $10 increments and the -- and the true alternative prices are $3, $5, and $7 -- -- then, indeed, you are setting the price. In other words, you are saying the consumer says, I'm paying a higher price for the product. It might be the entire 30 percent commission, it might be some portion of the 30 percent commission, that's super-competitive, but I'm paying a higher price for the product. And the app developer says: Well, I don't -- you know, that's irrelevant to me. I don't have to buy the product. What's relevant to me is fewer people are buying my apps. And that represents some amount of lost profits. But those two things are not -- I mean, it is true that two people are being able to sue because Apple is -- is transacting with each of these people and each of them has a gripe against what -- the way Apple has structured the market. But the damages are entirely different. One is a measure of lost profits, which may or may not exist. The other is I'm paying too much. And -- and -- and the rule of the end in 99-cent requirement in that theory is what? In other words, would your theory be the same if no such requirement existed, or would it not? So what's the significance of that end in 99-cent rule? ",do your answer to justice breyer depend on what you say that the alleged monopolization be in the distribution function because i understand the the respondent now to be say no that be wrong the allege monopolization be in the apps themselves in other word the consumer say you have a monopoly on apps you might also have a monopoly on the distribution function which the app developer have to live with but you have a monopoly on apps which the consumer have to live with so in respond to justice breyer you say well it be because the alleged monopoly be the distribution function but i do not think that that be correct well mr wall i think you be avoid the question a bit because i mean the question that be be put to you by my colleague be really what be illinois brick about be it about a vertical supply chain or instead be it about a pas through theory now in the fact of illinois brick and indeed in the fact of all the illinois brick case that we have discuss you have both so you do not have to separate the two and now here you do not have both because this be not a vertical supply chain but there still be a pas through mechanism so then the question be do illinois brick apply to that or not and i think what justice breyer be suggest to you that as long as it be not that vertical supply chain where the person be not buy from the monopolist itself here the person be transact with the monopolist itself that that be what separate this case from illinois brick and make it entirely different notwithstanding that there be some kind of pas through mechanism involve general i have to say i find that a not intuitive argument i mean because it just seem to me that when you be look at the relationship between the consumer and apple that there be only one step i mean i pick up my iphone i go to apple s app store i pay apple directly with the credit card information that I have supply to apple from from my perspective I have just engage in a one step transaction with apple and when i come in and say apple be a monopolist and apple be charge a super competitive price by by extract a commission that it can only extract because of its market power i mean there be my one step do it make a difference general that that apple be influence the price here in other word this be you be suggest that the app developer be just sort of set these price independently but I will give you sort of two way in which that be not true the first way be this cent charge which you might say well that do not matter because you know it could be cent or it could be but in fact these be all low cost product for the most part so say a price have to end with the you know the the number be say a lot about the fact that you can not charge cent or cent or cent so that be one and the other be the entire allegation here be that apple be truly a monopolist on both side of the market it be able to dictate to developer whatever price structure it want and it be also able to dictate to consumer what the nature of the sale be go to be and in that event it it sure seem as though you know apple you know it happen to set up this commission that put it in the ambit of illinois brick but it could have do a thousand other thing that be essentially the same that would have take it out of the illinois brick rule but if you have to bid in increment and the and the true alternative price be and then indeed you be set the price in other word you be say the consumer say I be pay a high price for the product it might be the entire percent commission it might be some portion of the percent commission that be super competitive but I be pay a high price for the product and the app developer say well i do not you know that be irrelevant to me i do not have to buy the product what be relevant to me be few people be buy my apps and that represent some amount of lose profit but those two thing be not i mean it be true that two people be be able to sue because apple be be transact with each of these people and each of them have a gripe against what the way apple have structure the market but the damage be entirely different one be a measure of lose profit which may or may not exist the other be I be pay too much and and and the rule of the end in cent requirement in that theory be what in other word would your theory be the same if no such requirement exist or would it not so what be the significance of that end in cent rule ,302.04,Case pending,"Nov 26, 2018","Apple, Inc.","Robert Pepper, et al.",17-204,"Jun 18, 2018",,114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2018,"Mission Product Holdings, Inc. v. Tempnology, LLC",114,Elena Kagan,"When -- when you say that, Ms. Spinelli, what law do you look to to find that, to find that principle? I mean, you say you look to outside bankruptcy law. Are you looking to state law? Is it a kind of common law? But -- but the difference -- it said specifically, didn't it, what the difference it thought there was, right? Which was this quality control -- -- obligation that Justice Alito started us off with. And I guess just to take us back there, why is it that that obligation does not make trademarks different under -- you -- you say we look to state law. I mean, is it -- are you saying that there's uniform state law that says that the quality control obligation sort of makes no difference with respect to this issue, that the entire contract is not unwound? Right. I mean, the question is whether the quality control obligation makes trademarks different -- -- from normal contract law. That's the question. I mean, just thinking -- I'm sorry. You know, just thinking about that example you gave, the analogy of the --- the lessor of real property, there is in many cities background law that says once the landlord stops maintaining the property, the city insists that the tenant leave because the property isn't safe anymore. And I guess one question is whether there might be or is a similar background rule with respect to what happens to a trademark where the obligation for quality control is not being maintained? Is that a silly analogy? And -- and you don't think that there's, outside bankruptcy, any special rule for trademarks? You agree -- Well, I just want -- I want -- I want you to tell me -- and I think this is consistent with Justice Ginsburg's question -- outside bankruptcy, what would be the rule in this context, in the trademark context? Right. But the question is whether you have any authority for the proposition that trademark is different, whether there's any authority that says if you're outside bankruptcy and the licensor breaches, is there any authority for the idea that the licensee then has to stop using the mark? Okay. But that's your -- that's your bigger argument, which is not a trademark argument. Your -- that's an argument about everything, right, which is that we should not read (g) to say that, you know, what (g) says, honestly, (g) says constitutes a breach. That suggests that you just look to the effects of a breach under non-bankruptcy law. Why -- why doesn't (g) say that? But what -- but what you're saying, Mr. Hallward-Driemeier, is that -- is that what (g) tells you is that you can unwind the entire deal. And that's not the effect of a breach outside of bankruptcy in -- in -- certainly in the usual context. Well -- Well, what language are you pointing to in 36 -- 365(g) that says anything other than we look to see what happens when you breach? Well, I think we can understand it. (Laughter.) I thought you were saying exactly the opposite, Mr. Hallward-Driemeier. I mean, you said this is consistent with the rule for photocopiers. But -- so could I -- -- understand the sort of nature of the argument? I mean, you have your general argument, and the way that goes is Ms. Spinelli says the effect of rejection is breach, and you say the effect of rejection is rescission. And that's the basic argument, where, you know, honestly, Ms. Spinelli has this language that says it constitutes a breach. So -- but -- So -- but then you say, even if Ms. Spinelli is right on that and we just look to what it means to breach outside non -- outside bankruptcy law, then you say we have a special rule for trademarks because trademarks are different outside bankruptcy law, and you point us to a single Seventh Circuit case, is that correct? ",when when you say that ms spinelli what law do you look to to find that to find that principle i mean you say you look to outside bankruptcy law be you look to state law be it a kind of common law but but the difference it say specifically do not it what the difference it think there be right which be this quality control obligation that justice alito start us off with and i guess just to take us back there why be it that that obligation do not make trademark different under you you say we look to state law i mean be it be you say that there be uniform state law that say that the quality control obligation sort of make no difference with respect to this issue that the entire contract be not unwound right i mean the question be whether the quality control obligation make trademark different from normal contract law that be the question i mean just think I be sorry you know just think about that example you give the analogy of the the lessor of real property there be in many city background law that say once the landlord stop maintain the property the city insist that the tenant leave because the property be not safe anymore and i guess one question be whether there might be or be a similar background rule with respect to what happen to a trademark where the obligation for quality control be not be maintain be that a silly analogy and and you do not think that there be outside bankruptcy any special rule for trademark you agree well i just want i want i want you to tell me and i think this be consistent with justice ginsburg s question outside bankruptcy what would be the rule in this context in the trademark context right but the question be whether you have any authority for the proposition that trademark be different whether there be any authority that say if you be outside bankruptcy and the licensor breach be there any authority for the idea that the licensee then have to stop use the mark okay but that be your that be your big argument which be not a trademark argument your that be an argument about everything right which be that we should not read g to say that you know what g say honestly g say constitute a breach that suggest that you just look to the effect of a breach under non bankruptcy law why why do not g say that but what but what you be say mr hallward driemeier be that be that what g tell you be that you can unwind the entire deal and that be not the effect of a breach outside of bankruptcy in in certainly in the usual context well well what language be you point to in g that say anything other than we look to see what happen when you breach well i think we can understand it laughter i think you we be say exactly the opposite mr hallward driemeier i mean you say this be consistent with the rule for photocopier but so could i understand the sort of nature of the argument i mean you have your general argument and the way that go be ms spinelli say the effect of rejection be breach and you say the effect of rejection be rescission and that be the basic argument where you know honestly ms spinelli have this language that say it constitute a breach so but so but then you say even if ms spinelli be right on that and we just look to what it mean to breach outside non outside bankruptcy law then you say we have a special rule for trademark because trademark be different outside bankruptcy law and you point us to a single seventh circuit case be that correct ,224.88,Case pending,"Feb 20, 2019","Mission Product Holdings, Inc.","Tempnology, LLC",17-1657,"Oct 26, 2018",,114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2018,"Washington State Department of Licensing v. Cougar Den, Inc.",114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. Purcell -- -- there are a lot of issues in this case, but just to make it easier for me, could I ask you to assume a couple of them and then could -- we could focus on one? So you know one issue is does the right to travel include the right to travel with goods, and I'm going to ask you to just assume that it does. And then another question is, does this treaty preempt generally applicable taxes? And I'm -- that's -- you've been talking a lot about that. And I'm just going to ask you to assume that it does. In other words, you know, if -- if -- if you have a toll on a road, for example, the fact that it's generally applicable, you still can't apply it to members of the Yakama Nation. I'm just going to ask you -- -- to assume that, okay? So, if both of those things are true, then it seems to me we come -- to me, the hardest issue, which is how do we look at this tax? Do we look at it as a tax that is preventing the Yakama from doing exactly what they bargained for in this treaty; in other words, it -- you know, it's not preventing but burdening the Yakama from traveling on roads with goods, or you keep on saying, well, no, because it's not targeted at that. It's not directed at that. It's a more broad tax on the possession of fuel. And I guess what I want to ask you is why that matters. I mean, it -- it does seem to me that from the Yakama's point of view, and they're, after all, the people who entered into the treaty, from the Yakama's point of view, this tax is burdening exactly what they bargained to get, which is the ability to transport their goods without any burdens, without a tax. I know -- maybe I'm not making myself clear. You're sort of saying, well, the tax applies in other circumstances to people who aren't transporting fuel. But I'm saying, from the Yakama's point of view, they're transporting goods on the road, exactly as the treaty says they can, and why do they care if you apply your tax in other circumstances as well? Why should they care? Why does it matter what the full scope of the tax is if, from the Yakama's point of view, the tax burdens exactly what they got as a result of its treaty? But what the treaty seems to present -- prevent is the state from taxing either travel or, as Justice Kavanaugh says, travel with goods. Isn't that exactly what they got in exchange for their land? Well, the -- the tax legislation taxes a wide range of activities. One is it taxes fuel that's removed in the state from a refinery, but the one that's being applied here is that it taxes motor vehicle fuel entering into this state. So entering into, this is a pretty standard importation tax, which is to say that it's taxing the travel of goods into the state, which, again, seems to be what the Yakama got as a result of this treaty: the ability to take goods to market and to take goods from market, regardless where that market is. Do you -- do you contest -- I mean, if you said what is Cougar Den doing, how would you describe what Cougar Den is doing, what its activity is? Because the way I would describe Cougar Den's activity is that it's bringing goods from market. I just really asked how would you describe Cougar Den's activity. You would describe it as possessing fuel as opposed to transporting fuel? So if Jack says I'm taking my pigs to market, and somebody says, what are you doing, Jack? He says, well, I'm taking my pigs to market. No, I think you're possessing your pigs, Jack. But I think what is at issue is the transport of goods to and from the market, which is what it seems the Yakama is engaging in here. But if -- if I disagree with you on that -- and I hadn't understood that you were taking that position in your brief -- but if I disagree with you on that and I use -- and I understand ""in common with"" the way Tulee understood ""in common with,"" then it seems, well, there they are, they're doing what this treaty says that the -- that this -- they're doing exactly what this treaty protects, which is transporting goods to and from market. But not because of the -- but not at the movement point, not -- not when it -- the -- the goods go from one state to another on the highway. Well, it might be thin, but shouldn't we say that the state has to do things the right way, which is to say the state has to do things without violating the treaty. And if the state has another way to do it, go for it. But what the state has done is to tax exactly the activity that's protected under the treaty, which is the -- which is the transportation of goods to and from market. Well, it uses the word enter. Enter is a -- It's a movement. Enter. Mr. Unikowsky -- Mr. Unikowsky -- -- it seems to me you can look at this in one of two ways, and which way you look at it, in part, you know, suggests who should win. The first is you -- you could say: What is the taxpayer here doing? Is what the taxpayer here doing within the terms of the treaty? And there, it just seems to me that you win because what the taxpayer is doing is transporting goods to and from market. You can say he's possessing the goods. You can say he's breathing while he's transporting the goods. But what he's doing is transporting goods to and from market. So -- so that suggests that you should win, where the focus is on the activity taxed. But what I hear the state and the SG in its brief saying is you shouldn't focus on the thing that the taxpayer is doing, you should instead sort of look to the purpose of the state. You should look to what is the full scope of activities that the state is trying to tax and why they have this tax. And according to them, they have this tax because they want to get to every single taxpayer who possesses fuel in the state. And this is what's necessary to get to Yakama taxpayers. So what should we focus on: the activity that the taxpayer is doing or the purpose of the state legislation? But on -- on that one, didn't Mr. Unikowsky say, consistent with our case law, that there's a difference between taxation and regulation? ",mr purcell there be a lot of issue in this case but just to make it easy for me could i ask you to assume a couple of them and then could we could focus on one so you know one issue be do the right to travel include the right to travel with good and I be go to ask you to just assume that it do and then another question be do this treaty preempt generally applicable tax and I be that be you have be talk a lot about that and I be just go to ask you to assume that it do in other word you know if if if you have a toll on a road for example the fact that it be generally applicable you still can not apply it to member of the yakama nation I be just go to ask you to assume that okay so if both of those thing be true then it seem to me we come to me the hard issue which be how do we look at this tax do we look at it as a tax that be prevent the yakama from do exactly what they bargain for in this treaty in other word it you know it be not prevent but burden the yakama from travel on road with good or you keep on say well no because it be not target at that it be not direct at that it be a more broad tax on the possession of fuel and i guess what i want to ask you be why that matter i mean it it do seem to me that from the yakama s point of view and they be after all the people who enter into the treaty from the yakama s point of view this tax be burden exactly what they bargain to get which be the ability to transport their good without any burden without a tax i know maybe I be not make myself clear you be sort of say well the tax applies in other circumstance to people who be not transport fuel but I be say from the yakama s point of view they be transport good on the road exactly as the treaty say they can and why do they care if you apply your tax in other circumstance as well why should they care why do it matter what the full scope of the tax be if from the yakama s point of view the tax burden exactly what they get as a result of its treaty but what the treaty seem to present prevent be the state from tax either travel or as justice kavanaugh say travel with good be not that exactly what they get in exchange for their land well the the tax legislation tax a wide range of activity one be it tax fuel that be remove in the state from a refinery but the one that be be apply here be that it tax motor vehicle fuel enter into this state so enter into this be a pretty standard importation tax which be to say that it be tax the travel of good into the state which again seem to be what the yakama get as a result of this treaty the ability to take good to market and to take good from market regardless where that market be do you do you contest i mean if you say what be cougar den do how would you describe what cougar den be do what its activity be because the way i would describe cougar den s activity be that it be bring good from market i just really asked how would you describe cougar den s activity you would describe it as possess fuel as oppose to transport fuel so if jack say I be take my pig to market and somebody say what be you do jack he say well I be take my pig to market no i think you be possess your pig jack but i think what be at issue be the transport of good to and from the market which be what it seem the yakama be engage in here but if if i disagree with you on that and i have not understood that you we be take that position in your brief but if i disagree with you on that and i use and i understand in common with the way tulee understood in common with then it seem well there they be they be do what this treaty say that the that this they be do exactly what this treaty protect which be transport good to and from market but not because of the but not at the movement point not not when it the the good go from one state to another on the highway well it might be thin but should not we say that the state have to do thing the right way which be to say the state have to do thing without violate the treaty and if the state have another way to do it go for it but what the state have do be to tax exactly the activity that be protect under the treaty which be the which be the transportation of good to and from market well it use the word enter enter be a it be a movement enter mr unikowsky mr unikowsky it seem to me you can look at this in one of two way and which way you look at it in part you know suggests who should win the first be you you could say what be the taxpayer here do be what the taxpayer here do within the term of the treaty and there it just seem to me that you win because what the taxpayer be do be transport good to and from market you can say he be possess the good you can say he be breathe while he be transport the good but what he be do be transport good to and from market so so that suggest that you should win where the focus be on the activity taxed but what i hear the state and the sg in its brief say be you should not focus on the thing that the taxpayer be do you should instead sort of look to the purpose of the state you should look to what be the full scope of activity that the state be try to tax and why they have this tax and accord to them they have this tax because they want to get to every single taxpayer who possess fuel in the state and this be what be necessary to get to yakama taxpayer so what should we focus on the activity that the taxpayer be do or the purpose of the state legislation but on on that one do not mr unikowsky say consistent with our case law that there be a difference between taxation and regulation ,387.52,Case

2018,Dawson v. Steager,114,Elena Kagan,"But an antidiscrimination provision doesn't necessarily require a most favored nation clause. And as I understand your answers to Justices Kavanaugh and Alito, you're saying there's a most favored nation requirement. What difference does that make? I mean, let's assume a situation where the State says state employees who are in one of these four plans, and let's further assume that everybody in those four plans receives a lesser benefit or, alternatively, contributes a greater percentage of their salary to the plan. So, you know, it's -- it's -- it's -- the State has just decided, look, this is a convenient way of identifying these people, but, in fact, all the people in these plans have that characteristic, which makes them different from the federal employees, that they contribute more or that they receive less in other benefits. Well, I guess my hypothetical was meant to take that off the table. To say assuming that that's not true -- -- and the State really has categorized precisely as -- as to benefit levels or contribution levels but not in those terms, you're -- you know, not in those terms, and you're saying that in itself is impermissible? If that's the problem, why were you suggesting that we remand this? It would just seem as though we should decide it if that's the problem. I -- I guess what I don't -- But I guess what I -- I don't understand about -- about what you think ought to be left open on remand is, if you think that the prime evil of this legislation is that it's not facially neutral, that a federal employee can't be a part of these state plans, so could never be treated in the same way, then all the State justifications like these people get fewer benefits, these people pay more in -- in -- in -- make more of a contribution, all of that, do I understand your position correctly, is just irrelevant? The -- you know, the -- the state court could find that these people get less benefits and that these people, the state employees, make a greater contribution, and -- and yet not be able to rule for the State. Is that correct? No, but even if he is in the favored class, you're saying he's not -- no, I -- I -- okay, I get it. I get it. Could you -- Well, what -- what could -- what could -- this is going to the exact same thing. What could West Virginia say on a remand and what could the West Virginia court find on a remand in -- in -- in defense of a decision for West Virginia? Like, how would that opinion read, a pro West Virginia opinion on remand? Oh, well, that's -- that was exactly my hypothetical. And your friend answered it the other way. And I -- I -- I thought that he answered it the other way because he said, even if they drew the line in exactly that way, the problem with this statute is that the federal employees can't get into the state plans. It's this benefits and contributions? Well, we can't possibly -- I'm sorry. So if I understand what you -- what you're saying, I think you suggested three characteristics of the members of these plans, and one is that they receive low benefits. Another is that they contribute a very substantial portion of their earnings to the plan. And the third, which I'm not sure I understand, but your third is that the plan itself is made up only of law enforcement officers. Is that correct? Now it seems to me that we couldn't possibly do anything -- suppose -- even if you were right, that -- that if the State showed all of that, I mean, we're not in a position to rule in your favor here. At the very most, you're entitled to -- or at the very most, what we should do is remand so that the state court could figure out whether, in fact, the members of this state plan, as compared to federal employees, receive lower benefits, make higher contributions, and are similarly in a -- you know, and -- and -- and don't share this characteristic of a law-enforcement-only plan? So that is very interesting because -- What -- what -- what strikes me about the way this argument has gone, it's a little bit unexpected for me, is that you and the SG actually agree. Because you think that the states should be able to prove that the members of this plan are different from federal employees, notwithstanding that the State has made a non-neutral distinction. And, on the contrary, LAWRENCE D. ROSENBERG thinks the fact that the State has made a non-neutral facial distinction is game over. ",but an antidiscrimination provision do not necessarily require a most favored nation clause and as i understand your answer to justice kavanaugh and alito you be say there be a most favored nation requirement what difference do that make i mean let us assume a situation where the state say state employee who be in one of these four plan and let us further assume that everybody in those four plan receive a less benefit or alternatively contribute a great percentage of their salary to the plan so you know it be it be it be the state have just decide look this be a convenient way of identify these people but in fact all the people in these plan have that characteristic which make them different from the federal employee that they contribute more or that they receive less in other benefit well i guess my hypothetical be mean to take that off the table to say assume that that be not true and the state really have categorize precisely as as to benefit level or contribution level but not in those term you be you know not in those term and you be say that in itself be impermissible if that be the problem why we be you suggest that we remand this it would just seem as though we should decide it if that be the problem i i guess what i do not but i guess what i i do not understand about about what you think ought to be leave open on remand be if you think that the prime evil of this legislation be that it be not facially neutral that a federal employee can not be a part of these state plan so could never be treat in the same way then all the state justification like these people get few benefit these people pay more in in in make more of a contribution all of that do i understand your position correctly be just irrelevant the you know the the state court could find that these people get less benefit and that these people the state employee make a great contribution and and yet not be able to rule for the state be that correct no but even if he be in the favored class you be say he be not no i i okay i get it i get it could you well what what could what could this be go to the exact same thing what could west virginia say on a remand and what could the west virginia court find on a remand in in in defense of a decision for west virginia like how would that opinion read a pro west virginia opinion on remand oh well that be that be exactly my hypothetical and your friend answer it the other way and i i i think that he answer it the other way because he say even if they draw the line in exactly that way the problem with this statute be that the federal employee can not get into the state plan it be this benefit and contribution well we can not possibly I be sorry so if i understand what you what you be say i think you suggest three characteristic of the member of these plan and one be that they receive low benefit another be that they contribute a very substantial portion of their earnings to the plan and the third which I be not sure i understand but your third be that the plan itself be make up only of law enforcement officer be that correct now it seem to me that we could not possibly do anything suppose even if you we be right that that if the state show all of that i mean we be not in a position to rule in your favor here at the very most you be entitle to or at the very most what we should do be remand so that the state court could figure out whether in fact the member of this state plan as compare to federal employee receive low benefit make high contribution and be similarly in a you know and and and do not share this characteristic of a law enforcement only plan so that be very interesting because what what what strike me about the way this argument have go it be a little bit unexpected for me be that you and the sg actually agree because you think that the state should be able to prove that the member of this plan be different from federal employee notwithstanding that the state have make a non neutral distinction and on the contrary lawrence d rosenberg think the fact that the state have make a non neutral facial distinction be game over ,285.9600000000001,Roberts Court,"Dec 3, 2018","James Dawson, et ux.","Dale W.

2018,Manhattan Community Access Corp. v. Halleck,114,Elena Kagan,"Mr. De Leeuw -- Mr. De Leeuw, what would you think is the right result if you had the obligation that you think you don't have? In other words, just assume for the moment that you did have to follow a first-come, first-served rule and that you didn't have the discretion that you think you have over programming. What would then the right answer be? Well, I guess I'm going back to Justice Ginsburg's question. On the assumption that you don't have discretion, that you have to follow a first-come, first-served rule, I think that Justice Ginsburg asked why doesn't that essentially make you -- you -- you've been designated by the city to administer a public forum. So you would say it's because you're private? Yeah. So -- but -- but I think the city thinks that it has a property right here. It has -- you know, it's a property right that comes from a contract where the city has reserved for itself the ability to decide what programming should be. Well, you can talk about it as an easement or you can just talk about it as a contract right, but -- but these cable operators would not be able to function unless the government had given them these public rights-of-way. And in exchange for giving them these public rights-of-way, the government says: Well, we're going to take certain stations and we're going to decide what the programming for those stations will be. And, you know, given that the whole thing doesn't get off the ground unless the government gives the cable operators the rights-of-way and that it -- it exacts a quid pro quo for that, why isn't there, call it what you want, a property right coming from a contract or an easement or whatever? What is the difference between Justice Alito's hypothetical? Well, let's say that the city has decided we want a public theater. And so it creates a public theater. It decides it wants to use a first-come, first-served system. It decides it doesn't want to do the scheduling itself, so it hires somebody to administer the public theater under the rules that it should all be first-come, first-served. Would -- would that administer be a -- a state actor? Right. So that could be one point of distinction -- -- is, is it property, and then we're back to the question that we started with. But put that aside for a moment. Well, the government says we set the rules about how this is going to operate. We decided we wanted a theater. We decided we wanted first-come, first-served. All we're asking you to do is, you know, we don't have an extra employee to administer this program, so we're contracting that function out. But what makes that person then the independent actor as opposed to the person who's essentially doing everything that the government would do, except that the government thinks it's more efficient to hire somebody else? Does -- -- does your position depend on our finding a governmental property interest and, if so, what is the interest? Where -- where's the line that -- that you think -- I mean, what you said, essentially, is the -- the administrator has no discretion. But suppose the city gave the administrator some discretion. Where -- where's the -- where's the appropriate line? I mean, suppose the -- the city -- suppose it weren't a complete public forum. Suppose there were subject matter limitations. Suppose that the -- the city gave the administrator some discretion to decide within particular areas which programs were better than other programs. Where is the line that this starts becoming not a public forum in your view? I think the question, Mr. Hughes, is what property interest does the government have? And it obtained that interest when it gave the rights-of-way to the cable operator, is that right? What it took back or what it reserved for itself was a property interest in these public access channels? So what you're saying is this is not just a lot of regulation. This is a property interest that the city reserved for itself when it gave over the rights-of-way that the cable company needs to do anything? What gives you the property interest is that you've given over the rights-of-way and you've kept access to -- to -- you've kept the rights to determine how to use public access channels. And you can do that yourself or you can use an administrator. Is that correct? ",mr de leeuw mr de leeuw what would you think be the right result if you have the obligation that you think you do not have in other word just assume for the moment that you do have to follow a first come first serve rule and that you do not have the discretion that you think you have over programming what would then the right answer be well i guess I be go back to justice ginsburg s question on the assumption that you do not have discretion that you have to follow a first come first serve rule i think that justice ginsburg ask why do not that essentially make you you you have be designate by the city to administer a public forum so you would say it be because you be private yeah so but but i think the city think that it have a property right here it have you know it be a property right that come from a contract where the city have reserve for itself the ability to decide what programming should be well you can talk about it as an easement or you can just talk about it as a contract right but but these cable operator would not be able to function unless the government have give them these public right of way and in exchange for give them these public right of way the government say well we be go to take certain station and we be go to decide what the programming for those station will be and you know give that the whole thing do not get off the ground unless the government give the cable operator the right of way and that it it exact a quid pro quo for that why be not there call it what you want a property right come from a contract or an easement or whatever what be the difference between justice alito s hypothetical well let us say that the city have decide we want a public theater and so it create a public theater it decide it want to use a first come first serve system it decide it do not want to do the schedule itself so it hire somebody to administer the public theater under the rule that it should all be first come first serve would would that administer be a a state actor right so that could be one point of distinction be be it property and then we be back to the question that we start with but put that aside for a moment well the government say we set the rule about how this be go to operate we decide we want a theater we decide we want first come first serve all we be ask you to do be you know we do not have an extra employee to administer this program so we be contract that function out but what make that person then the independent actor as oppose to the person who be essentially do everything that the government would do except that the government think it be more efficient to hire somebody else do do your position depend on our find a governmental property interest and if so what be the interest where where be the line that that you think i mean what you say essentially be the the administrator have no discretion but suppose the city give the administrator some discretion where where be the where be the appropriate line i mean suppose the the city suppose it be not a complete public forum suppose there we be subject matter limitation suppose that the the city give the administrator some discretion to decide within particular area which program we be good than other program where be the line that this start become not a public forum in your view i think the question mr hughes be what property interest do the government have and it obtain that interest when it give the right of way to the cable operator be that right what it take back or what it reserve for itself be a property interest in these public access channel so what you be say be this be not just a lot of regulation this be a property interest that the city reserve for itself when it give over the right of way that the cable company need to do anything what give you the property interest be that you have give over the right of way and you have keep access to to you have keep the right to determine how to use public access channel and you can do that yourself or you can use an administrator be that correct ,266.42,Case pending,"Feb 25, 2019","Manhattan Community Access Corporation, et al.","Deedee Halleck, et al.",17-1702,"Oct 12, 2018",,114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2018,The American Legion v. American Humanist Association,114,Elena Kagan,"What would happen if all the facts that you gave were the same, except for the 93 years? In other words, a community decides, for whatever reason, we don't have a World War I memorial; we want to put up exactly this to memorialize the -- the -- the war dead from -- from World War I, but now. And -- and does that answer apply not just to memorials for World War I soldiers but to memorials for soldiers from any armed conflict? Well, here are some facts, Mr. Katyal, from that hypothetical. And you can understand how something like this can come about, that people want to memorialize the dead, and in one religious tradition, and a dominant one in many, many communities of this country, the preeminent symbol to memorialize the dead is the Latin cross. And -- and so they gravitate toward that symbol as a way to memorialize the dead. But, at the same time, for members of other faiths, that symbol is not a way to memorialize the dead and does not have that meaning. So I think that the question that Justice Ginsburg is asking, you know, for many people, this is a very natural way to do exactly what they want to do. For others, not. What -- what counts as proselytizing? I think I understand what coercion means better than what proselytizing means. Well, suppose a city -- -- suppose a city erected a cross not for purposes of memorializing the war dead or -- but just to emphasize the values of Christianity. Would -- would that be proselytizing, or would that not be proselytizing? Right. This one is not -- -- on top of City Hall. This one is, you know, in a park. It's just a cross. This is -- they want to emphasize the values of Christianity, so they put up a cross. Well, I guess what -- what -- what I was trying to suggest was that this was something that indicated that the city was aligning itself with one particular religion. We're putting up a cross. We're not putting up any other religious symbols because we believe in the values that the cross indicates. But it's -- it's not on top of City Hall. It's on a street. It's in a park. Maybe there are two crosses. Maybe there could be 10 crosses, you know, in different parts of the city. But that's why the -- the -- the city is doing it. And, of course, everybody recognizes what a cross is. Well, is there? It's just a -- it's just a cross. It really is. So it's -- it's -- it's -- you know, these values are important to this community, the values of Christianity, so we would like to put up some crosses around town. Justice Scalia once -- -- Justice Scalia once asked a question when somebody gave that example. He said, what -- what would happen if a coin had said ""In Jesus Christ we trust""? But do I -- So, Mr. Wall, just to -- -- figure out where you want to draw the line, just take a lot -- I'm going to give you an example of a bunch of different crosses. So one is World War I cross erected many, many years ago. Another is World War I cross erected now. A third is another war memorial cross. A fourth is a memorial cross that has nothing to do with any war. A fifth -- are we up to five? A fifth is not a memorial cross at all, just a cross, it's a cross, because a community wants to put up a cross. Are they all okay? Are some not okay? And the fifth? Could -- Could you take the -- the examples I gave that are neither the first nor the fifth, in other words, just the memorial crosses but not any particular relationship to World War I, and -- and erected now. On -- on what theory are -- are -- are -- are those permissible? In other words, when -- when -- is the theory that this is a universal symbol? Is the theory that this is a secular symbol? Is the theory that this is a religious symbol, but that's perfectly fine, to adopt one religious symbol rather than another? What's the theory? I think that that's an odd kind of case, so I -- I think let's -- let's not talk about that one. Let's just talk about your ordinary decision to erect -- to -- you know, not anything that's found in a -- you know, let's just talk about -- -- an ordinary municipal decision to erect a cross as a way to memorialize some group of citizens. And -- and I guess I ask, why is that? Is it because the cross has become a symbol that's universal? Is that what your -- your claim is? I mean, it is the foremost symbol of Christianity, isn't it? It invokes the central theological claim of Christianity, that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for humanity's sins and that he rose from the dead. This is why Christians use crosses as a way to memorialize the dead. Is it because it connects to that central theological belief, isn't that correct? May -- may I ask about this cross -- I'm sorry. So this cross, Ms. Miller -- This cross, Ms. Miller -- -- it's very old, was erected almost 100 years ago, right after World War I. It does have -- it's two fallen soldiers from World War I, and World War I does have this history that this is how soldiers were memorialized in World War I. And it's true not all soldiers. When you go into a World War I battlefield, there are Stars of David there, but because those battlefields were just rows and rows and rows of crosses, the cross became, in people's minds, the preeminent symbol of how to memorialize World War I dead. And then you have these other facts that Mr. Katyal started us off with. There are other war memorials around the park. There's no -- there are no religious words on the memorial, quite the opposite. All the words on the memorial are words about military valor and so forth. So why in a case like that can we not say essentially the religious content has been stripped of this monument? Or the particular religious content? Well, I guess what I'm -- what I'm suggesting -- And I really did mean to confine it to this World War I context, because I think there's something quite different about this historic moment in time when -- so if you look -- you know, if you look at all the crosses that are war memorials, they're basically all World War I memorials, that this was sort of the -- because of the battlefields and the way the crosses were erected there, this became the preeminent symbol for how to memorialize the war dead at that time. Why isn't that important? Ms. Miller -- -- why does it even matter -- Ms. -- Ms. Miller, I -- I've been struck, some of these questions about how people process these symbols and what messages they convey, that you've sort of accepted this idea that that's what we should be thinking about. But why isn't it enough to just say: Does erecting a symbol like this align the government with a particular religion and not align it with every other religion? ",what would happen if all the fact that you give we be the same except for the year in other word a community decide for whatever reason we do not have a world war i memorial we want to put up exactly this to memorialize the the the war dead from from world war i but now and and do that answer apply not just to memorial for world war i soldier but to memorial for soldier from any arm conflict well here be some fact mr katyal from that hypothetical and you can understand how something like this can come about that people want to memorialize the dead and in one religious tradition

but at the same time for member of other faith that symbol be not a way to memorialize the dead and do not have that meaning so i think that the question that justice ginsburg be ask you know for many people this be a very natural way to do exactly what they want to do for others not what what count as proselytizing i think i understand what coercion mean good than what proselytize mean well suppose a city suppose a city erect a cross not for purpose of memorialize the war dead or but just to emphasize the value of christianity would would that be proselytize or would that not be proselytize right this one be not on top of city hall this one be you know in a park it be just a cross this be they want to emphasize the value of christianity so they put up a cross well i guess

different part of the city but that be why the the the city be do it and of course everybody recognize what a cross be well be there it be just a it be just a cross it really be so it be it be it be you know these value be important to this community the value of christianity so we would like to put up some cross around town justice scalia once justice scalia once ask a question when somebody give that example he say what what would happen if a coin have say in jesus christ we trust but do i so mr wall just to figure out where you want to draw the line just take a lot I be go to give you

It says that the term doesn't run when the person is imprisoned in connection with a conviction. Right? So when doesn't the term run? The term doesn't run when the person is imprisoned in connection with a conviction, meaning that the conviction has to have occurred and the person has to have been imprisoned in connection with it. No? Even under -- am I right about this -- that even under your view of the statute, you will run into that problem in certain situations?

2018,Timbs v. Indiana,114,Elena Kagan,"So we are several steps removed, but I think that the import of some of these questions is, look, we've made it awfully, awfully hard to assert a disproportionality claim with respect even to imprisonment. And if it's at least equally hard to assert a disproportionality claim with respect to fines, we could incorporate this tomorrow and it would have no effect on anybody. What is the -- on the federal side, how does this work? What kind of forfeitures have been held unconstitutional? Have any? If I -- if I understood your response to Justice Gorsuch, it was essentially that we can't answer the question wholesale, that we have to look at the particular right being invoked. So I guess the question is, do you have a theory about how we go about dividing up rights? You know, how do we decide that we're looking at a particular right against in rem forfeitures as opposed to a general right against excessive fines? I mean, that seems to make the incorporation question sort of indistinguishable from the substantive question. But, again, it -- it just seems as though there are two questions, and one question is incorporating the right, and the other question is the scope of the right to be incorporated. And, really, what you're arguing is about the scope of the right. And we can incorporate the right -- -- without saying a word about the scope of the right. Now, as you say, Austin says something about the scope of the right, and that's a problem for you. But -- but you're really asking us to talk about the scope of the right, aren't you? Well, that's why -- why I asked at the beginning what's your theory for how you define the right and which history you look to -- -- because you're really suggesting that we don't take the right wholesale; we try to chop it up. And I guess, you know, there are always going to be questions about the scope of the right to be incorporated. And, so far, we have not addressed those questions when we've decided whether to flip the switch of incorporation or not. We've understood those questions to be distinct and -- and to be questions for another day. And why is it that you're saying we should not use that pretty standard practice and instead start chopping up the right at the incorporation stage? ",so we be several step remove but i think that the import of some of these question be look we have make it awfully awfully hard to assert a disproportionality claim with respect even to imprisonment and if it be at least equally hard to assert a disproportionality claim with respect to fine we could incorporate this tomorrow and it would have no effect on anybody what be the on the federal side how do this work what kind of forfeiture have be hold unconstitutional have any if i if i understand your response to justice gorsuch it be essentially that we can not answer the question wholesale that we have to look at the particular right be invoke so i guess the question be do you have a theory about how we go about divide up right you know how do we decide that we be look at a particular right against in rem forfeiture as oppose to a general right against excessive fine i mean that seem to make the incorporation question sort of indistinguishable from the substantive question but again it it just seem as though there be two question and one question be incorporate the right and the other question be the scope of the right to be incorporate and really what you be argue be about the scope of the right and we can incorporate the right without say a word about the scope of the right now as you say austin say something about the scope of the right and that be a problem for you but but you be really ask us to talk about the scope of the right be not you well that be why why i ask at the begin what be your theory for how you define the right and which history you look to because you be really suggest that we do not take the right wholesale we try to chop it up and i guess you know there be always go to be question about the scope of the right to be incorporate and so far we have not address those question when we have decide whether to flip the switch of incorporation or not we have understand those question to be distinct and and to be question for another day and why be it that you be say we should not use that pretty standard practice and instead start chop up the right at the incorporation stage ,140.76000000000005,Roberts Court,"Nov 28, 2018",Tyson Timbs,Indiana,17-1091,"Jun 18, 2018","Feb 20, 2019",114.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

It's not a good reason for repeating yourself. Mr. Clement -- -- you agree that if the word ""full"" wasn't in the statute you would lose? Okay. So we -- we decided a case earlier this year on the basis of the legal proposition that adjectives modify nouns. Why doesn't that kill you in this case? In other words, ""full"" can only modify costs as defined in 1920. But that's a strange kind of thing, because you -- we started, you said, if it just said cost, we would all understand that it was the term of art in 1920 costs. And then you say that by adding the word ""full,"" rather than to say, look, it really is the full amount of the 1920 costs, don't try slicing and dicing the 1920 costs, rather, you want to use the word ""full"" to suggest that it's not the 1920 costs we're talking about at all. It's some different kind of costs. Well, haven't we said we expect redundancy in these kind of statutes?
