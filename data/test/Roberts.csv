2018,Bucklew v. Precythe,111,"John G. Roberts, Jr.","We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 17-8151, Bucklew versus Precythe. Mr. Hochman. That's to -- your termination point at that is when the EEG is zero, right? But -- but, for major surgery, they don't wait until the EEG is zero. It's, what, 40 or 50, something like that? So why are we concerned about the time to get to zero? Well, I don't know, but they're -- they -- they undertake major surgery with the EEG at a much -- -- higher level here than you're talking about -- Is that because of the injection difficulties? Well, does that include the femoral injection option, or are you only talking about the regular veins? Could I ask -- Could I ask you to address the reasonable alternative question? I know you think it's not required in your case, but assuming that it is, how can it be a reasonable alternative if it's never been used before? Well, one of the things we see often in the Eighth Amendment cases is the point or allegation that things can go wrong regardless of the method of execution. And it seems to me that if you have a method that no state has ever used, that that danger is magnified. And yet your claim is that this is a better -- a better alternative? Well, but that gets to the point -- I mean, you understand the theory between Baze and Glossip, which is what the Eighth Amendment prohibits is the unnecessary infliction of pain. If the death -- death penalty is constitutional, as it now is, there must be a way to administer it. But, if you can show that there's another way that is less painful, then the theory is, again, that it's an Eighth Amendment claim because it's unnecessary pain. But, again, it seems to me that you can't make that showing with respect to something that's never been -- never been used by any other state. Thank you, Mr. Hochman. Sure. Mr. Sauer.

But, when it comes to the -- the 30 percent increase, you're -- you're obviously saying the purchasers, again, under your theory of the apps, are harmed by that and recover -- can recover damages for that, and also that the developers are harmed by that and they can recover damages for it as well. In other words, to the extent it might be said that Apple is a two-sided market, they're -- they're subject to suit on both sides of the market for a single antitrust price increase that they're alleged to have imposed. No, no, I understand -- I understand your claim on your side of the market. But you do think that the developers have a claim as well, don't you? It's the same?

2018,"Washington State Department of Licensing v. Cougar Den, Inc.",111,"John G. Roberts, Jr.","We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 16-1498, Washington State Department of Licensing versus Cougar Den. Mr. Purcell. Thank you, counsel. Not -- not so fast. (Laughter.) I did that once too. Ms. O'Connell. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Unikowsky. So if -- if this -- these were apples coming into the State of Washington and there was a fee to -- but they inspected the apples to make sure they weren't diseased and the people who owned the apples had to pay that fee, is that problematic if it wasn't motor fuel, oil, but just apples, a fee to inspect the apples and prevent disease from spreading to other Washington apples? Well, that's kind of the -- well, in other words, everybody else bringing apples in has to pay the fee to inspect the apples, but the tribe doesn't, even though -- or the -- the fee can't be assessed if the tribe is transporting the apples? But -- but -- but no fee can be assessed if the tribe is transporting the apples? Even if the apples don't belong to the tribe? They're bringing them to somebody -- you know, they're just bringing them down the road? Yeah. Isn't that what's going on here? I thought -- -- it was the owner -- I thought it was the owner of the fuel that is taxed, not the -- -- not the transporter? So it's not who owns -- it -- it's not a -- a separation between the goods and the transport, right? So -- so, if it's the owner, why do you -- why does it interfere with a right to travel? Does it make a difference -- I think this is the argument on the other side -- that it's assessed per gallon, in other words, that suggests as opposed to per mile that you're carrying it? It suggests that it's -- it's based on possession if it's based on right there at that moment how much do you have. They don't care where it's going. They don't care if you use it all up right at the border or -- or whatever. It has nothing to do with -- with travel. It's purely on the good itself. Well, what if you have the -- the tank where the fuel is going to go in is -- is right by the border and it's a tax on fuel that goes into the tank? They don't care what you do with it; you can transport it, you can -- whatever you want to do with it. And it's owned by Cougar Den, the -- the -- the tank, and they then use it, transport it in their trucks. In other words, the state doesn't care about transportation. It just wants -- as soon as it comes into the border, with no involvement by Cougar Den, it comes into -- it's taxed in their tank, and then that's it. End of story as far as the state's concerned. No, I'm talking about my hypothetical tax, okay? It -- as soon as it goes into a tank, not one of the tanker trucks, then it's taxed on that. As soon as you -- it enters into a tank at the border and it's taxed, is that okay? Nothing to do about transportation at all. A non- -- non-Indian truck. Well, you want to characterize it as a transport tax, and the statute doesn't say that either. Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, Mr. Purcell. Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.

2018,Dawson v. Steager,111,"John G. Roberts, Jr.","We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 17-419, Dawson versus Steager. What if -- Have any -- Well, but there -- he -- he was different things. He's not just somebody who was working in the Marshals Service. He was for a while. And then maybe you have an argument with respect to the other state. But he was also the U.S. Marshal -- -- and that is not like a cop on the beat. I would suspect he's not accompanying fugitives when they move from one -- I mean prisoners when they move from one place to another. His job is, you know, more policy, administrative. Does some of his retirement money come from his time as U.S. Marshal? Well, what do you do in that situation? I mean, we have different comparators on the state side, but he himself embodies, at least arguably, two entirely different types of job. I don't think that's right. His responsibilities didn't include tracking down fugitives or the other things that somebody, you know, at the -- at the sort of operational level of the service does. I mean, would you say the Attorney General would qualify in this situation? He has law enforcement duties. Well, how different? I mean, a marshal is appointed by the President, right? And -- and confirmed by the Senate, right? Well, that seems to me a little bit different than -- than, as I said, the -- you know, someone who's, day one, starting at the bottom level at the Marshals Service. Well, yeah, but I'm wondering whether or not we should be parsing out if part of his retirement seems similar and part not. Is the head of the Marshals Service covered? In other words, not one of the state marshals but the -- the head of the Marshals Service? Yes. So his -- his duties are the same as somebody who's on his first day? Yeah. Well, he lives somewhere. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Huston. Well -- well, it's, I think, related to your point. Where are you on the dialogue I had with Mr. Rosenberg? Does -- are the benefits that, say, your -- your boss, the Attorney General, receives exempt? Think carefully before answering. (Laughter.) Well, I'm sure. But I'm more interested in how -- how you're going to carry out that division. In other words, say facially discriminatory, but with respect to what duties, what category of duties? Well, but that seems to me that you're looking at the State's purpose, and I thought the whole point was that you look just to the source of income. Thank you, counsel. Ms. See. Well, I think that -- I understand your point is because there's discrimination, it's not necessarily discrimination on the basis of source, if you can find some other basis. And then you'd say it's based on the amount of contributions or whatever. But I understand Davis to talk -- to say you don't get to do that. If you're saying, if you're federal, you don't get it, they're going to assume that it's based on something that's -- that's not permissible. I mean, if your -- if that -- if your basis is something else, you ought to say that. You ought to say where -- where, you know, people who have this percentage contributions or whatever, and if the federal employees don't qualify, they don't qualify. But as soon as you say it's -- you have to have the state retirement plan and not the fed's, I think the idea in Davis was, well, you kind of presume that that's based on discrimination based on, as they say, the source of income. Well, but, I mean, you've got to figure how -- how many. I mean, if Charleston is one of the ones that does, I mean, maybe 10 percent of them don't. That statistic really doesn't tell us anything. Well, and to get back -- this is pertinent, I think, to your response to Justice Breyer and to me -- how do you reconcile with your answer this language from Davis? In Davis, it said a tax exemption truly intended to account for differences in retirement benefits would not discriminate on the basis of the source of those benefits, as Michigan's statute does, whether it would discriminate on the basis of the amount of benefits received by individual retirees. So that's why I -- I mean, I'm concerned about the idea that, yes, it says the source, is it federal or state, but we really think it's something else. And Davis seems to say you can't do that. Well, here, Phillips -- Phillips -- I'm sorry. Phillips Chemical said the same thing. There, it said the argument was that federal land was taxed differently because of its size, value, or number of employees. And what the Court said is the classification erected by Texas law is not based on such factors. And, therefore, it rejected it. Most -- No, go ahead. It seems to me that Davis makes it very clear that that's not a significant consideration. If you have a small retirement benefit, and say this is available for all people who do X, unless you're paid from a federal plan, would that violate Davis or not? You have 99 percent of the state employees are not eligible for it, but it says if you're in this category, a tiny category, you get the benefit, unless you're a federal retiree. Yeah, but that first question was not the one I asked. I asked a different one, which is you argued that, well, it depends on how many of the state employees are eligible or not. And I thought Davis said specifically it doesn't, it depends upon the source. So if it -- if it's five employees in the state, and there's one who's a federal employee, and your plan says these five get it and no federal employee gets it, does that violate Davis or not? Well, you just said it doesn't matter and then you tell me it matters. Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, LAWRENCE D. ROSENBERG. Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted. ",we will hear argument first this morning in case dawson versus steager what if have any well but there he he be different thing he be not just somebody who be work in the marshal service he be for a

In the case that you point out comes before us on the pleadings. Yeah. The city can kick you out at any time, right?

Did you want to -- did you want to complete your answer to Justice Alito? Thank you, counsel. Mr. Hughes. Well, I think they just did dispute it. I mean, getting to Justice Breyer's questions, can they lump things together? And can they say 5:00 is the show on hot dogs? And if -- even if your show on the subway was submitted prior to one on hot dogs, the one on hot dogs is going to jump over it? Well, but it seems to me a significant departure from first-come, first-served in that they can -- the programming -- they're curating the programming. They're saying, we're going to have a show about this subject, and we're going to put people who want to talk about it on, surely in order, yes, the -- the first hot dog show gets on before the third or fourth, but it doesn't -- it's a significant departure from that. Your -- your idea that you can control, is that based solely on your power which your -- your friend called into question to terminate the operator? Okay. But jump ahead to we've got somebody in place. Okay. Well, jump ahead again to this case. Right. And -- and your argument is that that greater power necessarily includes all the lesser powers? So, because you have the power to terminate, you have the power to select programming? Well, we've already established that there's some wiggle room at least in that since you can have the hot dog program, and you can have the subway program, regardless of whether the subway people wanted their shows before the hot dogs. Tell me -- -- what is the interest that it reserved for itself? Where -- where does it say that they retain the interest over the content on the channel? Yeah, I thought that's where you were telling me they reserved that property right. And I just wonder, where -- where is there anything that says that extends to what's -- what appears on the channel? Okay. I believe it may be critical as well. And as far as I can tell, there seems to be a significant factual dispute over what first-come, first-served actually means. You agree it doesn't actually mean first-come, first-served? I mean, if they're -- if they've got a program on the subways and somebody says my -- you know, my show about something else was submitted first, well, too bad, you can show that tomorrow.

We'll give you that. You know, the -- the requiring people to pay for the church, prohibiting -- imposing burdens on people who don't believe. I mean, all pretty stark items that -- that certainly under -- underlay the Establishment Clause when it was adopted. But you're certainly -- I don't understand your position to be limited in that way. Thank you, counsel. General Wall. Thank you, General. Ms. Miller. Well, just to follow up on Justice Gorsuch's question, what if you had one letter from one person who purported to be offended by it? Would that be enough to support your argument? What about -- I was just going to ask, I understand Native American totems have spiritual and religious significance. If one of those is on a federal -- on federal property, does it have to be torn down? Well, it has spiritual and religious significance for Native Americans, similar to, let's say, religious symbols, a Star of David, a cross. So, if the -- if the local government in the community were Native American, whether it's on the reservation or a -- a native village in Alaska, that would make a difference? Well, but that's one of the main criticisms of the -- of the Lemon test, that different people are going to process that in different ways. I mean, you heard from one of your friends on the other side that one of the major fundraisers of this was a Jewish individual. So he was obviously observing it or anticipating it in a different way. Well, I was just going to say, if -- if I were, I once was, a lower court judge and I get that type of analysis, I'm just going to throw my hands up. Those are 20 different facts, how big is it, where, you know, is it located. And maybe that's the best we can do. But do you -- do you have like something more concise about the test you would apply beyond looking at all the contextual factors and history and all that? You have a couple minutes left. Thank you, counsel. Three minutes, Mr. Katyal. Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted. ",we will hear argument this morning in case the american legion versus the american humanist association and number the consolidated case maryland national capital park and plan commission versus the american humanist association mr katyal well I be sorry but i i think you just say that the test be whether there be a secular purpose i think i read your brief to put a lot of weight on the fact that the cross here have more than a sectarian meaning because as your history set forth the cross be a symbol throughout the battlefield in world war i now I be wonder why that do not limit your argument in so that in such a case as justice kagan hypothesize you would not accept that thank you counsel mr carvin counsel i be just go to say you start out with what you you advertise be a pretty concise test but it degenerate pretty quickly into well i need to know about this i need to know about that and become kind of a fact specific test rather than the the the crisper one that you propose in your brief well but if you look at his of course you have his brief highlight six thing that he would say would be and it start out with the government establish a church all right we will give you that you know the the require people to pay for the church prohibit impose burden on people who do not believe i mean all pretty stark item that that certainly under underlay the establishment clause when it be adopt but you be certainly i do not understand your position to be limit in that way thank you counsel general wall thank you general ms miller well just to follow up on justice gorsuch s question what if you have one letter from one person who purport to be offend by it would that be enough to support your argument what about i be just go to ask i understand native american totem have spiritual and religious significance if one of those be on a federal on federal property do it have to be tear down well it have spiritual and religious significance for native american similar to let us say religious symbol a star of david a cross so if the if the local government in the community we be native american whether it be on the reservation or a a native village in alaska that would make a difference well but that be one of the main criticism of the of the lemon test that different people be go to process that in different way i mean you hear from one of your friend on the other side that one of the major fundraiser of this be a jewish individual so he be obviously observe it or anticipate it in a different way well i be just go to say if if i we be i once be a low court judge and i get that type of analysis I be just go to throw my hand up those be different fact how big be it where you know be it located and maybe that be the best we can do but do you do you have like something more concise about the test you would apply beyond look at all the contextual factor and history and all that you have a couple minute leave thank you counsel three minute mr katyal thank you counsel the case be submit ,208.0,Case pending,"Feb 27, 2019","The American Legion, et al.","American Humanist Association, et al.",17-1717,"Nov 2, 2018",,111.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
2018,Mont v. United States,111,"John G. Roberts, Jr.","We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 17-8995, Mont versus United States. Ms. Malone. Well, of course, you got the ben -- you got the benefit of that period in the actual sentence of conviction. I mean, that was credited to his sentence, right? What are -- what are the cred -- and what would you say the granting of that period was in connection with? I mean, that's the language of the statute. I understand your ""is imprisoned"" argument, but it's in connection with a conviction. So he's given credit for that period in connection with the conviction, right? But it's the term of imprisonment in connection with the conviction? It's got to be in connection with the conviction, or it wouldn't be -- nothing to credit it to. Well, but it would still -- that's because there's no conviction that it can be in connection to, right? No, that -- that doesn't help you? Well, it is a little different. I mean, the supervision is a lot easier if the person's in jail, right? So, I mean, I understand your point, but it does -- it does seem to me that the -- the imprisonment changes the obligations significantly under supervised release and -- and alters the degree of supervision. I guess -- I guess, just to -- -- to interrupt, I guess I would say I would think of the period that you're detained as being a lot more like the period you'd be imprisoned than the period when you're out free and being supervised. Thank you, counsel. Ms. Ellickson. But they could have -- I mean, what they could have said -- I think closer to what Justice Breyer was looking for -- any period in which the person is considered to have been imprisoned in connection with a conviction. And I -- I -- I mean, the difficulty is that they're engaging in -- in something of a legal fiction because there's a conviction and the judge says, well, you're getting five years and we're going to start counting 10 months ago. I mean, the -- the -- the process of imposing the sentence sort of changes the nature of how the period has been counted. Now I don't know which way that counts, but there -- it seems to me there is a way to read it that's pretty close to the way it reads. Well, your friend on the other side suggests that's not true. Suggests that when you're in detention that a lot of the features of supervised release can still continue. Why is drug testing? I -- I assume they do drug testing in prison on a pretty regular basis. Well, that -- I was going to say that's just because, I mean, they're going to have different periods of preconviction detention as well. Well, in some sentencings, judges may say you get credit for the time in pretrial detention and others would say you don't. I mean, people in different situations have different consequences, I guess, including for supervised release. That doesn't seem particularly compelling. The other things seemed more serious than -- than that. Thank you, counsel. Ms. Malone, you have four minutes remaining. Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.

2018,Timbs v. Indiana,111,"John G. Roberts, Jr.","We'll hear argument this morning in Case 17-1091, Timbs versus Indiana. Mr. Hottot. Well, but you can see there's different arguments about whether -- and this, I gather, is the State's primary submission -- whether excessive fines are prohibited and whether civil in rem forfeitures are. And I certainly understand the argument that the disproportion and excessiveness arguments would be quite different with respect to forfeiting the instrumentalities of the crime. I mean, an argument could be made, well, that's always proportionate since it's the way the crime is accomplished. Well, of course, the -- the argument there was not for the purposes we're talking about today in terms of incorporation. And if the test is, as it has been, you know, whether it's essential, fundamental, and all that, you can see a distinction between saying, okay, you're going to be fined $500,000 and saying, you know, you're going to -- I mean, the action is not against the individual. It's against the asset. And so you will lose assets that you use in crime. The first one sounds, yeah, that's pretty excessive. The second one, you can certainly argue, well, that makes a lot of sense. But -- but your assumption is that you assess the particular circumstances of the case. I mean, I suppose if you ask people do you think six months is an excessive sentence for whatever it was, three counts of dealing in, you know, hazardous illegal drugs, many people might say no. It's only when you say, well, is six months too much for the -- whatever the circumstances were here, the much -- I don't want to say insignificant, but lighter quantities involved, what do you look at? The particular circumstances or what the crime is? The crime is not dealing with tiny amounts of drugs. The crime that he's convicted for is much broader than that. Well, but you're asking us to, you know, buy a pig in a poke; in other words, you're saying incorporate this, but, you know, we're -- we don't even know whether it means we're going to decide whether $10,000 is enough or $20,000, or if we're simply going to say something along the lines of Harmelin, which it's not just that it's whatever so many grams; it's that it's the third offense, and so that's -- that's what's the -- protection against that is fundamental to -- to a civilized society or whatever the standard is that we've been applying. And you say don't worry about what it means; just incorporate it and then figure it out later on. Well, that's contrary to a lot of civil forfeiture law. I mean, this was an instrumentality of the crime. This is how he got to the -- the deal place and how he carried the drugs. Normally, I mean, you're carrying the -- the drugs in your car, I think it's pretty well established your -- your car can be forfeited. Well, does it make a difference -- we've been talking about the value of the -- the item. What if the -- the person doing this, you know, was a multimillionaire? Forty-two thousand dollars doesn't seem excessive to him. And -- and yet, if someone is impoverished, it is excessive? Does that matter? Thank you, counsel. General Fisher. Well, are we going to be wiping all that away or just leaving that for another day? I mean, it -- it -- what -- I guess this gets back to Justice Gorsuch's first question. I mean, the question presented is does the Excessive Fines Clause -- you know, is it incorporated in the Eighth Amendment? And I guess your argument is -- seems to be this isn't an excessive fine, and, in fact, it isn't a fine at all. Well, we can deal with that later, right? Well, you just -- you just want us to make sure that in our opinion that we say, if we're ruling against you, that the excessive fines are incorporate -- incorporated under -- under our incorporation doctrine and not say civil in rem forfeitures are incorporated? Thank you, General. Mr. Hottot, four minutes. Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted. ",we will hear argument this morning in case timbs versus indiana mr hottot well but you can see there have different argument about whether and this i gather be the state s primary submission whether excessive fine be prohibit and whether civil in rem forfeiture be and i certainly understand the argument that the disproportion and excessiveness argument would be quite different with respect to forfeit the instrumentality of the crime i mean an argument could be make well that be always proportionate since it be the way the crime be accomplish well of course the the argument there be not for the purpose we be talk about today in term of incorporation and if the test be as it have be you know whether it be essential fundamental and all that you can see a distinction between say okay you be go to be fin and say you know you be go to i mean the action be not against the individual it be against the asset and so you will lose asset that you use in crime the first one sound yeah that be pretty excessive the second one you can certainly argue well that make a lot of sense but but your assumption be that you assess the particular circumstance of the case i mean i suppose if you ask people do you think six month be an excessive sentence for whatever it be three count of deal in you know hazardous illegal drug many people might say no it be only when you say well be six month too much for the whatever the circumstance we be here the much i do not want to say insignificant but light quantity involve what do you look at the particular circumstance or what the crime be the crime be not deal with tiny amount of drug the crime that he be convict for be much broad than that well but you be ask us to you know buy a pig in a poke in other word you be say incorporate this but you know we be we do not even know whether it mean we be go to decide whether be enough or or if we be simply go to say something along the line of harmelin which it be not just that it be whatever so many gram it be that it be the third offense and so that be that be what be the protection against that be fundamental to to a civilized society or whatever the standard be that we have be apply and you say do not worry about what it mean just incorporate it and then figure it out later on well that be contrary to a lot of civil forfeiture law i mean this be an instrumentality of the crime this be how he get to the the deal place and how he carry the drug normally i mean you be carry the the drug in your car i think it be pretty well establish your your car can be forfeit well do it make a difference we have be talk about the value of the the item what if the the person do this you know be a multimillionaire forty two thousand dollar do not seem excessive to him and and yet if someone be impoverish it be excessive do that matter thank you counsel general fisher well be we go to be wipe all that away or just leave that for another day i mean it it what i guess this get back to justice gorsuch s first question i mean the question present be do the excessive fine clause you know be it incorporate in the eighth amendment and i guess your argument be seem to be this be not an excessive fine and in fact it be not a fine at all well we can deal with that later right well you just you just want us to make sure that in our opinion that we say if we be rule against you that the excessive fine be incorporate incorporate under under our incorporation doctrine and not say civil in rem forfeiture be incorporate thank you general mr hottot four minute thank you counsel the case be submit ,234.95999999999992,Roberts Court,"Nov 28, 2018",Tyson Timbs,Indiana,17-1091,"Jun 18, 2018","Feb 20, 2019",111.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
